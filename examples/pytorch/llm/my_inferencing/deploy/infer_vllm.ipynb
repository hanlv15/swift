Here’s a quick guide on how to spot symptoms, risk factors, prevent spread of the disease, and find out what to do if you think you have it.\\nInformation 2:\\nPublication date: None\\nTitle: press-release\\nContent:\\nIllinoisans can resume activities without wearing a mask indoors on February 28th except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. Federal requirements, in effect through at least March 18, include all transportation systems such as airports, planes, trains, and buses. \"Preparing to repeal statewide masking mandates at the end of the month is aggressive and optimistic but reasonable,\" said Dr.\\n\"Broad mandates are not about individuals. They are put in place to help protect communities, businesses, and healthcare access. Repealing the mask mandate allows people to choose the mitigation layers that are best for them and I have no doubt that many should and will choose to keep mask rules.\"\\nIf these trends continue — and we expect them to —then on Monday, February 28th, we will lift the indoor mask requirement for the State of Illinois,\" said Governor JB Pritzker. \"I want to be clear: Many local jurisdictions, businesses and organizations have their own mask requirements and other mitigations that must be respected.\\nSeth Trueger, a Northwestern emergency physician who is also immunocompromised. \"Masking has helped slow the spread even in the face of omicron\\'s transmissibility.

A: A face covering is a mask or cloth face covering that covers your nose and mouth.\\nExceptions may be made for individuals with medical conditions or disabilities that prevent them from safely wearing a face covering. For more information, refer to the questions on reasonable accommodations. A: Masks still must be worn by everyone on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation; in transportation hubs, such as airports and train and bus stations; in health care settings; and in congregate facilities, such as correctional facilities and homeless shelters.\\nThese frequently asked questions are to provide guidance regarding the application of the face covering requirement in Executive Order 2021-10 for businesses and other places of public accommodation subject to Article 5 of the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/.
