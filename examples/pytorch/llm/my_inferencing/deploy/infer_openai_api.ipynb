      "\n",
      "To accurately classify this claim, we need to analyze the relevant information provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Information 1: This is from 2013 and is not directly related to the claim about Illinois strengthening face mask rules in businesses in 2020. It provides general information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk factors, and prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 2: This information confirms that Illinois lifted its indoor mask requirement on February 28, 2022, except where required by specific laws, rules, and regulations. It also mentions that the state was optimistic about this decision due to the decreasing trends of COVID-19 cases. The information does not directly contradict the claim about strengthening face mask rules in 2020, but it provides context about the situation in 2021-2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 3: This information reveals that on September 3, 2021, the Governor of Illinois signed an Executive Order requiring face coverings for individuals over the age of 2 in indoor public places. It also mandated vaccination for specific groups. This information supports the claim that Illinois strengthened face mask rules in businesses in 2020, as the Executive Order was issued in September 2021, which falls within the timeframe of the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 4: This information provides FAQs for businesses regarding the use of face coverings during COVID-19. It explains the definition of a face covering, exceptions for medical conditions or disabilities, and situations where masks are still required. While this information does not directly confirm the claim, it reinforces the general context of face mask rules in businesses during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 5: This information is a list of statewide orders regarding face masks, compiled by a law firm. It is important to note that this resource is no longer being updated as of November 10, 2022. However, it does provide context about the widespread implementation of face mask rules during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the claim's exact date is not directly supported by the provided information, the context and the Executive Order from September 2021 (Information 3) suggest that Illinois did indeed strengthen face mask rules in businesses during the timeframe mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim can be classified as TRUE.\n"
