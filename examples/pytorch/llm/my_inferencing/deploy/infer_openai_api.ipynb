Information 4, from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, shows the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases or per 100,000 population for the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19. Information 5, from Our World in Data, provides information on the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19.\n",

      "The claim is a news article about COVID-19, and the information presented in the article is consistent with the information presented in the other sources. However, the claim does not provide any specific details about the hospital mortality data or the drug trial that raised eyebrows.\n",

      "Information 3 provides specific data on in-hospital mortality among confirmed COVID-19 cases, but it does not mention any drug trial. Information 4 provides data on the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases or per 100,000 population for the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, but it does not mention any drug trial or hospital mortality data. Information 5 provides data on the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19, but it does not mention any drug trial or hospital mortality data.\n",

      "Therefore, while the information presented in the claim is consistent with the information presented in the other sources, it does not provide any specific details about the hospital mortality data or the drug trial that raised eyebrows.
