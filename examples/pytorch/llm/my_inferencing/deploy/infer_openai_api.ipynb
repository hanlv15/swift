URL Copied! WBEZ brings you fact-based news and information. Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter. A state panel Tuesday sided with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in his fight against COVID-19 by approving a rule that could mean fines of up to $2,500 for “rogue” businesses that don’t require patrons wear facial coverings.\\nNow, the only consequences would be felt by businesses and their financial bottom lines. But that change wasn’t enough to satisfy Republicans, who failed in their effort to block the new rule from taking effect. The GOP pushback fell two votes shy of the necessary eight votes required to block the rule. “Honestly, having talked with some of the Illinoisans who refuse to wear masks, passing this administrative rule is not going to make people more likely to wear a mask,” said state Sen.\\nSince then, Pritzker’s administration eliminated a provision from the earlier version of the rule that would have subjected individuals who run businesses that flout state mask-wearing requirements to a Class A misdemeanor, which theoretically could carry jail time upon conviction.\\nLocal public health departments or law-enforcement agencies would first have to give rule-breaking businesses or groups written notice that they were violating the state mask-wearing order. Then, if that step didn’t produce compliance, local officials could order people in the business or facility to disperse.\\nInformation 4:\\nPublication date: 2023-04-14\\nTitle: Mask Mandate FAQ - Illinois Manufacturers' Association\\nContent:\\nWhile the mask mandate applies to all employers, these new fines and penalties are aimed at consumer-facing businesses that are open to the public.

A little over 4.8 million people in the state are fully vaccinated, according to data from the department of public health. The state’s updated policy on masks follows changes from the U.S.\\n“With public health experts now saying fully vaccinated people can safely remove their masks in most settings, I’m pleased to follow the science and align Illinois’ policies with the CDC’s guidance.” · Pritzker went on in his statement to say he supports individuals and business who choose to continue to wear a mask “out of an abundance of caution as this pandemic isn’t over yet.” · The Democratic governor is one of those still wearing a mask — nearly eight weeks after receiving a dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in Springfield.
