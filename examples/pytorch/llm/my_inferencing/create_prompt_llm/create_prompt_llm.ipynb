      "Information 1, published on 2020-12-01, discusses a false claim about a Covid-19 vaccine having the ability to \"transfer genetic material\" and manipulate human genes. The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response.
