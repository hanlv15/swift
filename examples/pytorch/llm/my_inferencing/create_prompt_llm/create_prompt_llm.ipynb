Kerr\\'s claim that 90% of Americans support universal background checks falls within the scope of the available data.\\nSome 90% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases.\\nIn 2015, for example, a national Public Policy Polling survey of gun owners found overwhelming support (83%) for background checks, a 2018 Gallup poll found that 95% of people supported \"requiring background checks for all gun sales,\" and in 2019, a Quinnipiac University poll from 2019 found that 94% of American voters supported universal background checks. The Pew Research Center wrote in 2019: When it comes to specific gun-related policies, the public finds broad agreement in certain areas. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91%) and Republicans and Republican-leaners (92%) say they strongly or somewhat favor barring people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns.\\n\\nHere is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:\\n\\nThe INFORMATION provided consists of five sources discussing the level of support among Americans for universal background checks on gun purchases. The sources include statements from Senator Chris Murphy, a poll from MPR News, and fact-checking articles from PolitiFact, Snopes, and Warriors coach Steve Kerr.\\n\\nThe main points from the INFORMATION are:\\n\\n* Senator Chris Murphy stated that 90% of Americans support universal background checks, citing a data point that 89% of Republicans and 89% of gun owners also support this measure.\\n* A poll from MPR News found that 80% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats support universal background checks, with 54% of Republicans also supporting gun licensing.\\n* PolitiFact and Snopes fact-checked similar claims and found them to be TRUE, citing multiple polls that consistently show majority support for universal background checks, often above 80% and sometimes above 90%.\\n* Experts suggest that the wording of questions in national surveys can vary, but the overall trend of strong support for universal background checks remains consistent.\\n\\nBased on this INFORMATION, there is reasonable evidence to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM> as TRUE. The <CLAIM> states that 90% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases, which is consistent with the findings from multiple polls and fact-checking articles. While the exact percentage of support may vary slightly depending on the poll or survey, the overall trend of strong majority support for universal background checks is clear.',\n",

Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group, catalogs deaths at the hands of police and last year recorded the highest number of killings since its national tracking began in 2013. The data suggests a systemic crisis and a remarkably consistent pattern, with an average of roughly three people killed by officers each day, with slight upticks in recent years.\\nAlbuquerque police killed six people in 2023, while many cities with substantially larger populations, including San Jose and Honolulu, each killed only one civilian last year. Some advocates have said gun culture in the state, particularly in rural areas, could be a factor in the high rates of police violence.

A spokesperson for the New Mexico governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, said in an email that she was “committed to promoting professional and constitutional policing”, and noted the governor signed a bill into law last year “aimed at increased accountability for those in this critical profession”. SB19 established a duty to intervene when officers witness certain unlawful uses of force; prohibited neck restraints and firing at fleeing vehicles; and required the establishment of a public police misconduct database.\\nThis contributes to the steady rate of violence, said Joanna Schwartz, University of California, Los Angeles law professor and expert on how officers evade accountability for misconduct: “Even with public attention to police killings in recent years and unprecedented community engagement, it’s really business as usual.\\nInformation 3:\\nPublication date: 2022-01-11\\nTitle: 2021 was deadliest year ever for law enforcement, report says\\nContent:\\nThe state with the highest number of duty deaths was Texas at 84 deaths.

The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response. Information 4, published on 2023-11-01, reiterates that Covid-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's genome and debunks false claims about DNA contamination leading to harmful effects. Information 5, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing vaccine misinformation to prevent vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nRestated Claim:\\nOn 2020-12-01, experts refuted the false claim that a Covid-19 vaccine can manipulate human genes.\\n\\nGiven the information available, the claim is TRUE. The Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to manipulate human genes, as confirmed by various experts and sources. These vaccines either use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response, but they cannot alter human DNA.\"\n",
