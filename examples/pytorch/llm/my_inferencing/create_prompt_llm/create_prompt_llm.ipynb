The article suggests that differences in mitigation efforts, vaccine uptake, and demographics may contribute to this disparity.\\n3. **Top 10 causes of death in the US, see the CDC’s latest list** (2024-08-11): This article reports on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) latest list of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, with COVID-19 ranking as the fourth leading cause of mortality in 2022.\\n4. **As Emergency Ends, a Look at Covid’s U.S. Death Toll** (2023-05-16): This article reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic's toll on the United States, noting that the country has suffered wave after wave of loss since the pandemic began.

      "I'd like to believe that out of this crisis, they are going to be lessons learned and people are going to take action, but I'm not sure that's true.” · McLean also spoke about the role private equity played in the healthcare industry. She referenced research from Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt that looked at how private equity investors undermine the financial stability of hospitals.\n",
      "She came to talk about her latest book, The Big Fail: What the Pandemic Revealed About Who America Protects and Who It Leaves Behind. McLean co-authored the book with Joe Nocera, her longtime editor at Fortune magazine. He served as editor on her first book, The Smartest Guys in the Room, about the Enron accounting scandal, and together, they co-authored her second book, All the Devils are Here, The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis. Their work consistently aims to dig beyond surface-level headlines and provide readers with a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that played a role in the outcomes.\n",
      "During the pandemic, many hospitals were faced with the threat of bankruptcy and had to be rescued with government financial support. At the very time that the hospitals were needed the most and were the busiest, she said, they were going bankrupt.  · “They're paid for elective surgeries, and I think the pandemic just laid bare how screwed up our healthcare system is and how it leaves people without access to healthcare.”\n",
      "“Private equity is almost entirely gone from the hospital industry,” she said. “But they didn't leave behind an improved industry that was functioning more efficiently. They left behind a debt-ridden mess, in essence, and yet they managed to make their money anyway.” · As McLean explained, investors made their money, in part, by selling the underlying real estate to an Alabama Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) called Medical Properties Trust.\n",

      "What’s ironic is that the strike will force these very health care systems to replace employed nurses with temporary nurses from staffing agencies, further compounding their financial woes, and ultimately, their bottom lines. Until we invest in people and their value in healthcare, we won’t be able to see light at the end of the tunnel. Everyday we read about hospitals throughout the country losing millions if not billions of dollars per year. Hospitals are closing urgent care centers, obstetric, pediatric and other services to try to survive. One of the major factors that has triggered this crisis is the lack of staff.\n",
      "It is not uncommon to hear that health care systems have shut down Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Obstetrics, and ICU. Other healthcare systems have gone to the point of closing down entire hospitals because of staffing issues. Another important factor is the crisis is that outpatient services have reduced hours and days.\n",

She referenced research from Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt that looked at how private equity investors undermine the financial stability of hospitals.\\nShe came to talk about her latest book, The Big Fail: What the Pandemic Revealed About Who America Protects and Who It Leaves Behind. McLean co-authored the book with Joe Nocera, her longtime editor at Fortune magazine. He served as editor on her first book, The Smartest Guys in the Room, about the Enron accounting scandal, and together, they co-authored her second book, All the Devils are Here, The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis. Their work consistently aims to dig beyond surface-level headlines and provide readers with a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that played a role in the outcomes.\\nDuring the pandemic, many hospitals were faced with the threat of bankruptcy and had to be rescued with government financial support. At the very time that the hospitals were needed the most and were the busiest, she said, they were going bankrupt.  · “They\\'re paid for elective surgeries, and I think the pandemic just laid bare how screwed up our healthcare system is and how it leaves people without access to healthcare.”\\n“Private equity is almost entirely gone from the hospital industry,” she said. “But they didn\\'t leave behind an improved industry that was functioning more efficiently. They left behind a debt-ridden mess, in essence, and yet they managed to make their money anyway.” · As McLean explained, investors made their money, in part, by selling the underlying real estate to an Alabama Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) called Medical Properties Trust.\\nInformation 2:\\nPublication date: 2023-07-20\\nTitle: Most hospitals profited off of pandemic, study finds\\nContent:\\nWhile policymakers had to react quickly on emergency relief, \"it will be important to consider alternative ways of allocating scarce public dollars to support our nation’s health system in crisis,\" they continued. The other side: Nearly half of hospitals still have negative operating margins today, per the American Hospital Association. 2022 was \"the worst year of the pandemic financially for hospitals and health systems, due to the rapid increase in expenses and the massive spike in COVID volume from the Omicron surge early that year,\" Aaron Wesolowski, vice president of policy research at AHA, said via email.\\nCOVID-19 funding was crucial particularly for government-run hospitals as well as safety-net facilities. Be smart: Hospitals treating higher proportions of Hispanic individuals experienced the most pandemic-related financial distress, the analysis found.\\nMore than 2,000 hospitals (53%) didn\\'t experience financial distress due to COVID-19 even without relief funds, but nearly three-quarters of those facilities received relief funds anyhow.\\nThe bottom line: \"COVID-19 relief funds went to some hospitals that did not need financial support or the amount of funding allocated,\" the authors of the analysis wrote.\\nInformation 3:\\nPublication date: 2023-01-10\\nTitle: The Coming Collapse of the U.S. Health Care System | TIME\\nContent:\\nPost pandemic, many of these individuals were not financially rewarded: they saw COVID-19 relief money go to upgrade facilities, build new buildings, and other non-employee rewards. This obviously changed the relationship between the bedside providers and hospital leadership.\\nWhat’s ironic is that the strike will force these very health care systems to replace employed nurses with temporary nurses from staffing agencies, further compounding their financial woes, and ultimately, their bottom lines. Until we invest in people and their value in healthcare, we won’t be able to see light at the end of the tunnel. Everyday we read about hospitals throughout the country losing millions if not billions of dollars per year. Hospitals are closing urgent care centers, obstetric, pediatric and other services to try to survive. One of the major factors that has triggered this crisis is the lack of staff.\\nIt is not uncommon to hear that health care systems have shut down Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Obstetrics, and ICU. Other healthcare systems have gone to the point of closing down entire hospitals because of staffing issues. Another important factor is the crisis is that outpatient services have reduced hours and days.\\nMedical technology companies cannot sell cutting edge ventilators, monitors and imaging devices to facilities that have no cash flow. Aging medical infrastructure cannot be repaired, upgraded or replaced in this financial environment. As a backdrop to this evolving crisis, we wonder why is this not a major news story.\\nInformation 4:\\nPublication date: 2022-05-26\\nTitle: Layoffs and Losses: COVID-19 Leaves U.S. Hospitals in Financial Crisis - Consumer Health News | HealthDay\\nContent:\\nEditors and writers make all efforts to clarify any financial ties behind the studies on which we report.

Overall and COVID-19–associated death rates decreased for all racial and ethnic groups. In 2023, White and AI/AN persons had the highest COVID-19–associated death rate (19.6 and 18.7, respectively), a shift from 2020−2022 when COVID-19 death rates were highest among AI/AN persons (1,6,7).\\nMore than 3 million persons died in the United States in 2023. The overall age-adjusted death rate in 2023 was 6.1% lower than in 2022. The overall death rate was highest among non-Hispanic Black or African American persons. The number of deaths from COVID-19 was 68.9% lower than in 2022.\\nBecause of the time needed to investigate certain causes of death and to process and review death data, final annual mortality data for a given year are typically released 11 months after the end of the calendar year. Provisional data, which are based on preliminary death certificate data sent to NCHS, provide an early estimate of deaths before the release of final data. NVSS routinely releases provisional mortality data for all causes of death, including deaths involving COVID-19.* This report presents an overview of provisional U.S.\\nNCHS coded the causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, which details disease classification and the designation of underlying cause of death§ (2). COVID-19 death counts and rates include deaths for which COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate as an underlying or contributing cause of death.¶ Leading causes of death were ranked by counts based on underlying cause of death (3). Data in this report exclude deaths among residents of U.S. territories and foreign countries. Age was unknown for 71 (<0.01%) decedents, and race and ethnicity were unknown for 10,068 (0.33%). To describe the trend in deaths during a given year, the number of deaths were calculated for each week from all causes and from COVID-19.\\nInformation 2:\\nPublication date: 2024-05-10\\nTitle: The Changing Political Geography of COVID-19 Over the Last Two Years\\nContent:\\nOverall, the COVID-19 death rate in all counties Trump won in 2020 is substantially higher than it is in counties Biden won (as of the end of February 2022, 326 per 100,000 in Trump counties and 258 per 100,000 in Biden counties). Partisan differences in COVID-19 death rates expanded dramatically after the availability of vaccines increased. Unvaccinated people are at far higher risk of death and hospitalization from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and vaccination decisions are strongly associated with partisanship.\\nDuring the summer of 2020, the largest share of the roughly 80,000 deaths that occurred during the pandemic’s second wave were in the southern parts of the country. The fall and winter months of 2020 and early 2021 were the deadliest of the pandemic to date. More than 370,000 Americans died of COVID-19 between October 2020 and April 2021; the geographic distinctions that characterized the earlier waves became much less pronounced.\\nBut by the third wave of the pandemic, which began in fall 2020, the pattern had reversed: Counties that voted for Donald Trump over Joe Biden were suffering substantially more deaths from the coronavirus pandemic than those that voted for Biden over Trump. This reversal is likely a result of several factors including differences in mitigation efforts and vaccine uptake, demographic differences, and other differences that are correlated with partisanship at the county level.\\nOver the past two years, the official count of coronavirus deaths in the United States has risen and is now approaching 1 million lives. Large majorities of Americans say they personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died of the coronavirus, and it has impacted – in varying degrees – nearly every aspect of life. A new Pew Research Center analysis of official reports of COVID-19-related deaths across the country, based on mortality data collected by The New York Times, shows how the dynamics of the pandemic have shifted over the past two years.\\nInformation 3:\\nPublication date: 2024-08-11\\nTitle: Top 10 causes of death in the US, see the CDC’s latest list\\nContent:\\n\"So while it’s good news that COVID-19 is causing fewer deaths than in previous years, we still want to be vigilant, as it continues to cause many deaths in the U.S.\" THESE 17 CANCER TYPES ARE MORE COMMON IN GEN X AND MILLENNIALS, AS STUDY NOTES \\'ALARMING TREND\\' Death rates were highest among the elderly, males and Black people, Siegel noted.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released the biggest causes of mortality in 2023.

COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020, under emergency use, beginning the national vaccination program, with the first vaccine officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 23, 2021.\\nBy mid-October, a third surge of cases began; there were over 200,000 new daily cases during parts of December 2020 and January 2021. COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020, under emergency use, beginning the national vaccination program, with the first vaccine officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 23, 2021. Studies have shown them to be highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. In comparison with fully vaccinated people, the CDC found that those who were unvaccinated were from 5 to nearly 30 times more likely to become either infected or hospitalized.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic ranks as the deadliest disaster in the country\\'s history. It was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. From 2019 to 2020, U.S. life expectancy dropped by three years for Hispanic and Latino Americans, 2.9 years for African Americans, and 1.2 years for white Americans.\\nDisproportionate numbers of cases were observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there was a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths occurred in many areas. The COVID-19 pandemic also saw the emergence of misinformation and conspiracy theories, and highlighted weaknesses in the U.S.\\nThere were also numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. A fourth rise in infections began in March 2021 amidst the rise of the Alpha variant, a more easily transmissible variant first detected in the United Kingdom.\\n\\n**Summary of INFORMATION**\\n\\nThe provided information consists of five articles related to COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States. Here\\'s a brief summary of each article:\\n\\n1. **Mortality in the United States — Provisional Data, 2023** (2024-08-08): This article reports on provisional mortality data for 2023, showing a decrease in overall and COVID-19 death rates compared to 2022. The article highlights that more than 3 million people died in the United States in 2023, with the highest death rates among non-Hispanic Black or African American persons.\\n2. **The Changing Political Geography of COVID-19 Over the Last Two Years** (2024-05-10): This article analyzes the political geography of COVID-19 deaths in the United States, finding that counties that voted for Donald Trump in 2020 had higher COVID-19 death rates than counties that voted for Joe Biden. The article suggests that differences in mitigation efforts, vaccine uptake, and demographics may contribute to this disparity.\\n3. **Top 10 causes of death in the US, see the CDC’s latest list** (2024-08-11): This article reports on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s (CDC) latest list of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, with COVID-19 ranking as the fourth leading cause of mortality in 2022.\\n4. **As Emergency Ends, a Look at Covid’s U.S. Death Toll** (2023-05-16): This article reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic\\'s toll on the United States, noting that the country has suffered wave after wave of loss since the pandemic began. The article includes a chart ranking causes of death in the United States, with COVID-19 ranking third in 2020 and 2021, fourth in 2022, and seventh in 2023.\\n5. **COVID-19 pandemic in the United States - Wikipedia** (2024-09-13): This Wikipedia article provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, including the timeline of the pandemic, vaccination efforts, and the disproportionate impact on certain populations.\\n\\n**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**\\n\\nThe CLAIM states that the number of people who have died in the U.S. in 2020 is on par with years prior to COVID-19. However, the provided information suggests that this CLAIM is FALSE.\\n\\nInformation 4 and 5 indicate that COVID-19 was a leading cause of death in 2020, ranking third in the United States. Information 5 also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic ranks as the deadliest disaster in the country\\'s history, with a significant drop in life expectancy for certain populations.\\n\\nFurthermore, Information 1 and 3 report on the high number of deaths in 2022 and 2023, with COVID-19 remaining a significant cause of mortality. While the death rates may have decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, the overall number of deaths remains substantial.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information, the CLAIM that the number of people who have died in the U.S. in 2020 is on par with years prior to COVID-19 is FALSE. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mortality rates in the United States, with a substantial number of deaths attributed to the virus.',\n",

The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response. Information 4, published on 2023-11-01, reiterates that Covid-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's genome and debunks false claims about DNA contamination leading to harmful effects. Information 5, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing vaccine misinformation to prevent vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nRestated Claim:\\nOn 2020-12-01, experts refuted the false claim that a Covid-19 vaccine can manipulate human genes.\\n\\nGiven the information available, the claim is TRUE. The Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to manipulate human genes, as confirmed by various experts and sources. These vaccines either use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response, but they cannot alter human DNA.\"\n",
