The exchange rate as of September 2015 was US$1=R$4.05. After a period of gradual recovery, it reached US$1=R$3 by February 2017. Jair Bolsonaro's tenure, initially welcomed with enthusiasm by the financial markets, started with US$1=R$3.86. Fueled by meager results of the economy, quick disenchantment followed, resulting in lack of foreign investments and real's strong depreciation. On 13 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply affected Brazil, the real reached a historical low against the US dollar, being negotiated at US$1=R$5.90.\\nIn the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downwards path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation. Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies, and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies.\\nThe Central Bank of Brazil is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994. As of April 2019, the real was the twentieth most traded currency. Currencies in use before the current real include: The Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis.

The country is ranked 69 among 175 countries in Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, which also reports that the country’s legal system is “plagued with inefficiencies and corrupt judges.”1 Brazilian elections are also believed to be infiltrated by corruption and, despite public outrage, politicians with prior convictions are often voted back to office.\\nThe country is ranked 69 among 175 countries in Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, which also reports that the country’s legal system is “plagued with inefficiencies and corrupt judges.”1 Brazilian elections are also believed to be infiltrated by corruption and, despite public outrage, politicians with prior convictions are often voted back to office. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, Brazil’s third-largest state with a population of 11.9 million as of 20122, “only one single politician in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro is said to have never fallen foul of the law,” according to one news report.3\\nIn Rio de Janeiro, for example, Brazil’s third-largest state with a population of 11.9 million as of 20122, “only one single politician in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro is said to have never fallen foul of the law,” according to one news report.3 · Additionally, a 2009 World Bank and IFC1 Enterprise Survey found that 70 percent of global and domestic companies viewed corruption as a “major constraint to doing business” in Brazil, while a Federation of the Industries of the state of São Paulo investigation found that corruption cost Brazil almost $40 billion (about 2.3 percent of GDP) in 2008 alone.4\\n6Savarese, Mauricio. “No End in Sight for Brazil’s Petrobras Scandal.” Americas Society / Council of the Americans.

Considering the provided information and the claim's publication date (2020-04-03), there is no direct evidence supporting or refuting the claim. However, information 5 highlights the pervasive corruption in Brazil, which might suggest a possibility of misappropriation of funds. However, this is not specific to the Paraíba state government or the timeframe mentioned in the claim. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is not possible to definitively classify the claim as true or false.\",\n",
