The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response. Information 4, published on 2023-11-01, reiterates that Covid-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's genome and debunks false claims about DNA contamination leading to harmful effects. Information 5, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing vaccine misinformation to prevent vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nRestated Claim:\\nOn 2020-12-01, experts refuted the false claim that a Covid-19 vaccine can manipulate human genes.\\n\\nGiven the information available, the claim is TRUE. The Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to manipulate human genes, as confirmed by various experts and sources. These vaccines either use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response, but they cannot alter human DNA.\"\n",
