It ruled that Meta was right to leave the video up under its current policy, which bars misleadingly altered videos only if they were produced by artificial intelligence or if they make people appear to say words they never actually said.\\nIt stopped short of calling for the policy to apply to photographs, saying that doing so might make the policy too difficult to enforce at Meta’s scale. Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, informed the board in the course of the review that it was planning to update the policy “to respond to the evolution of new and increasingly realistic AI”, according to the ruling. The clip on Facebook manipulated real footage of Biden exchanging “I Voted” stickers with his granddaughter during the 2022 US midterm elections and kissing her on the cheek.\\nInformation 2:\\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\\nTitle: \\'In a while pedophile\\': Donald Trump Jr smears Joe Biden with series of baseless social media posts | The Independent | The Independent\\nContent:\\nDonald Trump’s eldest son on Saturday posted a social media message suggesting Joe Biden was a paedophile, an incendiary and baseless charge that illustrates the tactics the president is turning to as he attempts to erase Mr Biden’s early advantage in key state polls.

Yet in the same Twitter post, he also reprised his original insinuation. He accused the former vice president of “unwanted touching” alongside a collage of photographs of Mr Biden showing affection for children.\\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.

The articles are from different sources and dates, ranging from 2020 to 2024. Here\\'s a brief summary of each article:\\n\\nInformation 1 (2024-05-02): Meta\\'s oversight board found that a Facebook video suggesting Joe Biden is a pedophile does not violate the company\\'s current rules, which focus on AI-generated content. The board deemed the rules \"incoherent\" and too narrowly focused.\\n\\nInformation 2 (2020-05-21): Donald Trump Jr. posted a social media message suggesting Joe Biden is a pedophile, which was baseless and incendiary. The post was criticized, and Trump Jr. later claimed he was \"joking around.\"\\n\\nInformation 3 (2024-05-04): This article appears to be a Facebook post about an altered video of President Biden, but the content is not provided.\\n\\nInformation 4 (2024-05-14): This article discusses rumors surrounding the allegedly stolen diary of Ashley Biden, Joe Biden\\'s daughter, which some claim contains evidence of pedophilia. However, there is no credible evidence to support these claims.\\n\\nInformation 5 (2022-07-13): This article\\'s title suggests that Joe Biden\\'s family privately refers to him as \"Pedo,\" but the content is not provided.\\n\\n<CLAIM> (2020-07-17): The claim states that Joe Biden is a pedophile.\\n\\nEvidence and Analysis:\\n\\nBased on the provided information, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Joe Biden is a pedophile. The articles and posts mentioned are either baseless accusations, rumors, or misinformation.\\n\\nInformation 1 highlights the issue of misleadingly manipulated videos on Facebook, but it does not provide evidence of Joe Biden\\'s involvement in pedophilia.\\n\\nInformation 2 shows Donald Trump Jr.\\'s attempt to smear Joe Biden with a baseless accusation, which was widely criticized.\\n\\nInformation 3 lacks content, making it impossible to analyze.\\n\\nInformation 4 discusses unverified rumors surrounding Ashley Biden\\'s diary, which lacks credible evidence to support the claims of pedophilia.\\n\\nInformation 5\\'s title is sensational, but the content is not provided, making it unreliable.\\n\\nThe <CLAIM> itself is a baseless accusation with no credible evidence to support it.\\n\\nClassification:\\n\\nBased on the available information, the <CLAIM> \"Say Joe Biden is a pedophile\" is classified as FALSE.

The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response. Information 4, published on 2023-11-01, reiterates that Covid-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's genome and debunks false claims about DNA contamination leading to harmful effects. Information 5, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing vaccine misinformation to prevent vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nRestated Claim:\\nOn 2020-12-01, experts refuted the false claim that a Covid-19 vaccine can manipulate human genes.\\n\\nGiven the information available, the claim is TRUE. The Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to manipulate human genes, as confirmed by various experts and sources. These vaccines either use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response, but they cannot alter human DNA.\"\n",
