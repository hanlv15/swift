The articles fact-check her statements and conclude that they are largely false or misleading.\\n\\n**Information 1**: A fact-checking article debunks several claims, including the alleged cover-up by Dr. Fauci, the lab-made origin of SARS-CoV-2, and the 36% increase in COVID-19 mortality due to influenza vaccines.\\n\\n**Information 2**: An article describes Dr. Mikovits\\' conspiracy theories as \"demonstrably untrue\" and mentions that her research was fraudulent.\\n\\n**Information 3**: A fact-checking article examines Dr. Mikovits\\' claims, including her statement that face masks \"activate\" the virus, and finds no evidence to support her assertions.\\n\\n**Information 4**: Dr. Mikovits\\' Wikipedia page summarizes her background, research, and controversies, including her promotion of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and her arrest in 2011.\\n\\n**Information 5**: A fact-checking article analyzes the \"Plandemic\" video, which features Dr. Mikovits, and debunks several false and misleading claims about COVID-19, vaccines, and treatments.\\n\\n**Evaluation of the CLAIM**\\n\\nBased on the provided information, the CLAIM is classified as **FALSE**.\\n\\nThere is no credible evidence to support Dr. Mikovits\\' claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci was paid to cover up the extent of the COVID-19 problem, that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab, or that influenza vaccines increase COVID-19 mortality by 36%. Multiple fact-checking articles and experts have debunked these claims, and Dr. Mikovits\\' research has been discredited due to fraud and lack of evidence.',\n",

No evidence of a COVID-19 cover-up by Dr. Fauci or any link between influenza vaccines and increased COVID-19 mortality. The claim about influenza vaccines increasing COVID-19 deaths originates from a misinterpreted study on four types of common coronaviruses, not SARS-Cov-2.\\n2. Dr. Judy Mikovits is a controversial virologist. Her claims of a scientific cover-up involving Dr. Fauci and \"Big Pharma\" lack credibility. She perpetrated a scientific fraud in 2009.\\n3. Dr. Mikovits has a history of unfounded and unscientific claims, including her belief that a flu vaccine caused a \"bad strain of flu virus\" that led to COVID-19. She also claims that wearing a mask \"literally activates your own virus\" and that the flu vaccine is responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.\\n4. Dr. Mikovits gained attention for spreading conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. No evidence exists to support her claims that the flu vaccine is responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.\\n5. The \"Plandemic\" viral interview with Dr. Mikovits contains a series of misleading and unsubstantiated claims. The claim that the flu vaccine is linked to an increased risk of novel coronavirus is not supported by any scientific evidence.\\n\\nGiven the information above, the claim that \"Dr. Mikovits, an established scientist, revealed that Dr. Anthony Fauci was paid to cover up the extent of the problem caused by COVID-19. Also, she revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab and that influenza vaccines increase COVID-19 mortality by 36%\" is FALSE.\\n\\nThere is no credible evidence to support the claim that influenza vaccines increase the risk of novel coronavirus, and the claim that the virus was created in a laboratory lacks any scientific credibility. Dr. Mikovits\\'s credibility is further undermined by her previous scientific misconduct and her spreading of conspiracy theories.'}"

The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook, but experts, such as Dr. Kirsty Short, have confirmed that the mRNA vaccine cannot enter the human genome. Information 2, published on 2020-05-19, mentions false claims about a future Covid-19 vaccine genetically modifying humans. Information 3, with no specific publication date, states that Covid-19 vaccines do not change a person's genes and use messenger RNA or modified adenovirus to trigger an immune response. Information 4, published on 2023-11-01, reiterates that Covid-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's genome and debunks false claims about DNA contamination leading to harmful effects. Information 5, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of monitoring and addressing vaccine misinformation to prevent vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nRestated Claim:\\nOn 2020-12-01, experts refuted the false claim that a Covid-19 vaccine can manipulate human genes.\\n\\nGiven the information available, the claim is TRUE. The Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to manipulate human genes, as confirmed by various experts and sources.

Information 1 explains that the World Bank clarified that the products labeled as \"Covid-19\" in the WITS database were medical equipment used for other purposes before the pandemic, but were classified as Covid-19 products by the World Customs Organization (WCO) to facilitate monitoring their movements during the pandemic.\n",

The data on the website showed previously existing devices that are now being used to fight the coronavirus, but the website initially displayed the data as if these devices were specifically Covid-19 test kits in 2017 and 2018. The World Bank confirmed that these products were available for other uses before COVID-19, but have recently been designated to support COVID-19 efforts.\n",

The data presented on the WITS website was misinterpreted, and the products labeled as \"Covid-19\" were medical equipment used for other purposes before the pandemic. Test kits for the virus that causes COVID-19 were only developed in 2020, as the virus itself was discovered in January 2020.\n"
