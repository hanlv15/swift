Title: United States Border Patrol - Wikipedia
Content:
Intelligence gathering has discovered bounties being placed on Patrol Agents to be paid by criminal smuggling organizations upon the confirmed murder or kidnapping of a U.S. Border Patrol Agent. In 2008, intelligence learned of a two-million-dollar contract for the murder of a Border Patrol Agent. In 2009 Border Patrol Agent Rosas was murdered in an ambush while on patrol; a bounty may have been paid to the assassins. Official data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows that between 2005 and 2017, the federal government paid out more than $60,000,000 in legal settlements of cases in which border agents were involved in deaths, driving injuries, alleged assaults, and wrongful detention.
In fiscal year 2020, Border Patrol agents and Air and Marine Operations agents are credited with saving more than 5,000 people and conducted approximately 1,400 search and rescue operations. There are 20 Border Patrol sectors, each headed by a sector chief patrol agent. All Border Patrol agents spend a minimum of 26 weeks at the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, which is a component of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC).
Between 2010 and 2011 alleged excessive use of force by Border Patrol agents and Field Operations officers led to the death of six Mexican citizens. A PBS report, Crossing the Line, released in July 2012, profiled the case of Hernández-Rojas who died after being beaten and while in custody of the USBP, ICE, and CBP in May 2010. In 2012, in a letter to President Obama posted on the website of the Washington Office on Latin America, 118 civil society organizations criticized the Border Patrol for failing to thoroughly investigate the incident and stated that the Border Patrol "is operating with very little transparency and virtual impunity, especially in the southern border region where Border Patrol and other CBP agents regularly violate the human and civil rights of those who call the border region home."

From 2008 to 2011, the Arizona organization No More Deaths interviewed nearly 13,000 illegal aliens who had been in Border Patrol custody, in the Arizona border towns of Naco, Nogales, and Agua Prieta.
For fiscal year 2019, the nationwide total of Border Patrol agents was 19,648, with 16,731 patrolling the southern border. Agents primarily patrol the Mexico–United States border, where they control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

In a federal gun trafficking investigation dubbed Operation Fast and Furious, hundreds of guns allegedly flowed from the U.S. to Mexico. Republicans say some of those weapons can be traced to the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. In hearings on Capitol Hill this week, Attorney General Eric Holder tried to explain what he knew, and when.

Congress Probes ATF Role In Border Agent's Death In a federal gun trafficking investigation dubbed Operation Fast and Furious, hundreds of guns allegedly flowed from the U.S. to Mexico. Republicans say some of those weapons can be traced to the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
The murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Mexico last year has touched off a scandal that's now reverberating in Washington. Members of Congress say that weapons found at the scene of Brian Terry's death have been traced to a federal program that allegedly allowed hundreds of guns to go from the U.S. across the border. Investigators at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives called it Operation Fast and Furious, just like the blockbuster movie.

Title: ATF gunwalking scandal - Wikipedia
Content:
He pleaded guilty after two AK-47 type rifles purchased by him were found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's death. Federal prosecutors stated that, in addition to gun trafficking, he had recruited others to do the same. He was under ATF surveillance at the time. In April 2017 a suspect in the 2010 murder of Patrol agent Brian Terry, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, was arrested on a ranch on the border of Sinaloa and Chihuahua, Mexico, by a task force that included the DEA, United States federal Marshals, the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, and Mexican law enforcement.
Conclusion of a recent investigation 18 month multi-agency operation "Fury Road" results in 82 federal prosecutions; seizure of 128 firearms, 1 kilogram of heroin and cocaine base. On July 9, 2012, an indictment charging five men in the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was unsealed.
One 20-year veteran of ATF's Tucson office told us that before Operation Wide Receiver, all of ATF's trafficking cases were very similar in their simplicity: ATF would get a tip from an FFL [Federal Firearms Licensee] about a buyer who wanted a large number of firearms and information about when the transaction was scheduled to take place, and would set up surveillance and arrest the buyer when he headed southbound or at the border. Sometimes the initial buyer would cooperate with ATF, and agents would arrest the actual buyer when he showed up to take possession of the guns.
Guns tracked by the ATF have been found at crime scenes on both sides of the Mexico–United States border, including the scene where United States Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in December 2010. The gunwalking operations became public in the aftermath of Terry's murder. Dissenting ATF agents came forward to Congress in response. According to Humberto Benítez Treviño, former Mexican Attorney General and chair of the justice committee in the Chamber of Deputies, related firearms have been found at numerous crime scenes in Mexico where at least 150 Mexican civilians were maimed or killed.
Participating in the meeting were Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, acting ATF Director Kenneth E. Melson, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrator Michele Leonhart, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Robert Mueller and the top federal prosecutors in the Southwestern border states. They decided on a strategy to identify and eliminate entire arms trafficking networks rather than low-level buyers. Those at the meeting apparently did not suggest using the gunwalking tactic, but Phoenix ATF supervisors would soon use it in an attempt to achieve the desired goals. The strategy of targeting high-level individuals, which was already ATF policy, would be implemented by Bill Newell, special agent in charge of ATF's Phoenix field division.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources related to the United States Border Patrol, arms trafficking, and the death of Border Patrol agents.

Information 1 (Wikipedia) provides an overview of the United States Border Patrol, including its structure, operations, and controversies. It mentions bounties placed on Patrol Agents by criminal organizations, excessive use of force by agents, and criticism from civil society organizations.

Information 2 (PolitiFact) fact-checks a claim by David Dewhurst that ballistic tests confirmed the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by weapons from a federal arms trafficking operation. The article provides background on the Fast and Furious operation, a multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation.

Information 3 (CBP Enforcement Statistics) presents data on CBP's enforcement activities, including border searches, apprehensions, and uses of force.

Information 4 (NPR) reports on a congressional probe into the ATF's role in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, who was killed in a shootout in Mexico. The article mentions that two assault weapons found at the scene were traced to the Fast and Furious operation.

Information 5 (Wikipedia) provides an overview of the ATF gunwalking scandal, including the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and the subsequent investigation and indictments.

**Evidence and Analysis**

The claim by David Dewhurst states that ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by weapons from a federal arms trafficking operation. Based on the provided information, there is evidence to support this claim.

Information 4 (NPR) and Information 5 (Wikipedia) both report that two assault weapons found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's death were traced to the Fast and Furious operation. This suggests that the weapons used in the shooting were part of a federal arms trafficking operation.

Additionally, Information 5 (Wikipedia) mentions that guns tracked by the ATF have been found at crime scenes on both sides of the Mexico–United States border, including the scene where Agent Terry was killed.

While the claim does not specify which Border Patrol agent's death was caused by weapons from a federal arms trafficking operation, the evidence suggests that Agent Terry's death is a likely candidate.

**Classification**

Based on the available information, I classify the claim as **TRUE**. The evidence suggests that ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent, likely Brian Terry, was caused by weapons that were part of a federal arms trafficking operation.

Data on this report is based on areas within the legal city boundary, outlined in black on the map. Any additional neighborhoods shown on the map are associated with the city by name and are included for reference only.
Importantly, when you compare Atlanta to other communities of similar population, then Atlanta crime rate (violent and property crimes combined) is quite a bit higher than average. Regardless of how Atlanta does relative to all communities in America of all sizes, when NeighborhoodScout compared it to communities of similar population size, its crime rate per thousand residents stands out as higher than most.
Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon. According to NeighborhoodScout's analysis of FBI reported crime data, your chance of becoming a victim of one of these crimes in Atlanta is one in 116.
Significantly, based on the number of murders reported by the FBI and the number of residents living in the city, NeighborhoodScout's analysis shows that Atlanta experiences one of the higher murder rates in the nation when compared with cities and towns for all sizes of population, from the largest to the smallest.

This means that new crime is estimated to occur every two minutes and 35 seconds. In the MSA of Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta, otherwise known as Metro Atlanta, the state’s 2022 crime statistical report found: Within a population of over 6,200,000 people, the number of crimes committed within this metropolitan area made up 61.4 percent of Georgia’s total reported illegal offenses.
It’s estimated that a violent crime, such as murder, rape, aggravated assault, or robbery, is committed every 14 minutes and 19 seconds on average in Georgia. Non-violent crimes, including burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, arson, and human trafficking, occur every three minutes and 10 seconds on average. This means that new crime is estimated to occur every two minutes and 35 seconds.
A: Holly Springs is regarded as the safest city in all of Georgia, as well as one of the safest cities across the country. It is located in Cherokee County, which has a crime index of 6.91 per 1,000. The city is north of Atlanta and consists of suburban neighborhoods that are also near to more bustling, urban areas.
The state of Georgia has a high frequency of property crimes, which can include theft/larceny, burglary, robbery, and fraud, as well as vandalism and arson. According to the 2022 summary report, larceny made up 60.95 percent of all reported crimes in the state, followed by motor vehicle theft and burglary crimes, with each making up roughly 10 percent of the state’s total crimes.

NPU A experienced its first homicide since 2018, a crime that shook neighborhoods in the northeastern most corner of the city. Taken as a group, however, the three northernmost NPUs bucked the citywide trend: the homicide rate dropped over 46% year-on-year. NPUs H, L, Y, and Z saw the largest increases in homicide rates.
Property crime has been trending down across all 25 of Atlanta’s NPUs over the 2009-2022 period, as seen below on Figure 3. However, some NPUs on the southside have seen small increases from their historic lows. The three northernmost NPUs, on the other hand, outperformed the rest of the city. They saw a 13% drop in the property crime rate between 2021 and 2022, from 255.4 incidents per 10,000 population to 221.4 per 10,000.
As mentioned in last year’s blog post, we saw a worrisome uptick in violent crime 2019 forward after a steady decline over the period 2009-18. But in 2022, Figure 4 illustrates that the citywide violent crime rate dropped over 7% year-over-year from 67.5 incidents per 10,000 population to 62.4 per 10,000, bested only by the historic low set in 2018.

Yet, the results of this year’s Metro Atlanta Speaks Survey (MAS) continued to find that crime was metro residents’ #1 concern, including in the city itself.[2] Do the actual crime data back up these perceptions (from MAS)?
After a steady decline in violent crime rates from 2009 to 2018, violent crime actually started to rebound the year before the pandemic began. However, even this with increase, the violent crime rate never exceeded its 2017 level and has since dropped to a new historic low in 2023.
Turning to homicides, the news is, of course, good. Figure 3, which follows, shows that the rate of homicide incidents dropped sharply year over year[3], to a level we have not seen since before the start of the pandemic.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM>:**

The <CLAIM> states that the crime rate in some Atlanta neighborhoods has dropped by 35 to 51 percent. While the provided information does not explicitly mention a 35 to 51 percent drop, it does suggest that crime rates have decreased in certain areas.

**Information 4** reports a 46% drop in homicide rates in some northern Atlanta neighborhoods, which supports the idea of a significant decrease in crime rates. Additionally, **Information 5** mentions a 21% drop in homicides in 2023, which further indicates a decline in crime rates.

However, the <CLAIM> is from 2013, while the provided information is from 2023 and 2024. It is possible that the crime rate drop mentioned in the <CLAIM> refers to a different time period or specific neighborhoods.

Based on the available information, I would classify the <CLAIM> as **PARTIALLY TRUE**, as it is supported by the general trend of decreasing crime rates in Atlanta, but the specific percentage drop and time period mentioned in the <CLAIM> are not directly confirmed by the provided information.

Title: How Does Fiscal Policy Impact the Budget Deficit?
Content:
Such policies are typically used to boost productivity and the economy. Conversely, the policy is contractionary when government spending decreases or taxes rise. Contractionary policies might be used to combat rising inflation. Generally, expansionary policy leads to higher budget deficits, and contractionary policy reduces deficits.
In times of economic expansion when businesses and consumers are spending at high levels, the government can choose to decrease its own spending. This could involve cutting back on public infrastructure projects, scaling down certain social programs, or trimming government contracts.
This could involve cutting back on public infrastructure projects, scaling down certain social programs, or trimming government contracts. By reducing government expenditures, the overall demand for goods and services in the economy decreases. This, in theory, can help to moderate inflationary pressures.
When individuals and businesses face higher tax obligations, they generally have less disposable income available for spending and investment. This decrease in spending and investment dampens aggregate demand, contributing to a reduction in inflationary pressures.

Title: Obama’s Foreign Policy Towards Israel: The Failure to Use Smart Power | Al Jazeera Centre for Studies
Content:
The United States cannot continue to claim its historical place as a beacon of democracy and liberty, and maintain its support for an occupying power that defies its values and harms its interests. The constant concessions to the Israeli government by the Obama administration have resulted in an avalanche of challenges by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the institution of the presidency.
The constant Israeli challenge to the institution of the presidency harms American national security interests and allows for others to undermine the prestige of the United States. Therefore, it is urgent that the president of the United States end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to preserve the prestige and credibility of the US around the world. Had the Obama administration made effective use of the smart power tools at its disposal, it would have achieved more preferable outcomes on the issues of a two-state solution and the thorny question of settlements, translating the Cairo speech into an effective strategy.
The constant concessions to the Israeli government by the Obama administration have resulted in an avalanche of challenges by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the institution of the presidency. For instance, the White House was not consulted on the shipment of weapons to Israel during Israel’s aggression against the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2014.
According to the two main theories of international relations, realism-neo-realism, and liberalism-neo-liberalism, states pursue foreign policy to accomplish four goals: protecting national security; achieving economic prosperity; spreading and protecting their own values; and increasing their political leverage and prestige.(4) A deep analysis of American foreign policy toward Israel reveals that the US has been harming itself by prolonging the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through constantly protecting Israel at the United Nations and other international forums; financing Israeli colonial pro

This cease-fire was shortly lived and sporadic fighting and attacks would continue to occur into the Obama administration. Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip on January 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn in as President. $900 million was pledged from Hillary Clinton to help the rebuilding process in Gaza.
While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the "effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions."
Before and after the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States, some Jews, including United States Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, questioned Obama's commitment to Israeli security. Obama maintained that he supports Israel and said he would continue the U.S. alliance with Israel as president.

Title: The Biden-Obama divide over how closely to support Israel
Content:
The current president believes his close embrace of Israel, which he called for as vice president, gives him greater influence with Israeli leaders and the public.
Biden also cited a quotation from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his 2014 book to argue that he has been right on how to handle Israel even though his views were rejected when he was vice president, according to two people familiar with his comments. In the book, Gates wrote that Biden “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”
WASHINGTON — In the first weeks of the Israel-Hamas war, President Joe Biden privately pointed to praise for his unconditional public support of Israel, as well as some initial successes in influencing its government, as vindication of advice he said President Barack Obama and his closest aides dismissed, according to five people familiar with his comments.
Biden recounted in private that when he was vice president in 2014 and Israel mounted a military assault on Gaza, Obama and his staff rejected his belief, held for decades, that the best way to approach the Israelis is to hug them close but not criticize them, the people familiar with his comments said.

Summary of the INFORMATION:

The provided information consists of five sources discussing the relationship between the United States and Israel, particularly during the presidency of Barack Obama.

Information 1 and 2 are identical, quoting an interview between Barack Obama and Jeffrey Goldberg for The Atlantic. In the interview, Obama states that Israel is not a drag on America's reputation overseas, but rather a "constant wound" or "constant sore" that "infects all of our foreign policy." The context suggests that Obama is referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a persistent problem that affects U.S. foreign policy.

Information 3 is an article from the Al Jazeera Centre for Studies, discussing Obama's foreign policy towards Israel. The article argues that the Obama administration's constant concessions to the Israeli government have resulted in challenges to the institution of the presidency and harmed American national security interests.

Information 4 is a Wikipedia article on the Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration. It provides a factual overview of the administration's actions and policies regarding Israel, including the 2008-2009 Israeli-Gaza Conflict and the provision of aid to Gaza.

Information 5 is an article discussing the differing approaches of Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama towards supporting Israel. The article mentions that Biden believes his close embrace of Israel gives him greater influence with Israeli leaders, whereas Obama's approach was more critical.

Evidence to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM>:

Based on the provided information, particularly Information 1 and 2, it is clear that Barack Obama did refer to Israel as a "constant sore" that "infects all of our foreign policy." This statement was made in the context of discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its impact on U.S. foreign policy.

Therefore, the <CLAIM> made by John Boehner on May 12, 2008, is classified as TRUE. The evidence from the Atlantic interview and other sources confirms that Obama used the phrase "constant sore" to describe the impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on U.S. foreign policy.

Title: Mexicans In The U.S. Are Sending Home More Money Than Ever : Goats and Soda : NPR
Content:
Many now worry that if they leave the United States they'll never be able to get back in. Whatever their reasons, Orozco posits that the fact that more Mexican migrants are remaining in the United States means many people who previously would have simply brought cash home in their pockets may now be sending it via money transfers. The growing importance of remittances is particularly significant in light of proposals that President Trump has floated to confiscate or otherwise target this flow in order to pressure Mexico into paying for an expansion of the border wall.
The recent surge is all the more notable because migration from Mexico has slowed to a crawl — with the number of migrants in the U.S. increasing by just 1 percent between 2010 and 2016 to a total of 11.8 million. Also, says Orozco, the median amount that any given Mexican migrant sends hasn't changed — about $300 at a go, 14 times a year, most commonly through a money transfer company such as Western Union. So what accounts for this surge in cash to Mexico? Orozco explains that a much larger share of Mexicans already in the United States are now wiring money back.
So what accounts for this surge in cash to Mexico? Orozco explains that a much larger share of Mexicans already in the United States are now wiring money back. In 2010 fewer than half of Mexican migrants sent money home. Today two-thirds do.
A possible explanation, he says, is that many Mexican migrants who would have gone back to Mexico are now staying put in the United States. His survey research indicates that from 2011 to 2016, the median length of time a Mexican migrant has lived in the United States increased from seven years to 12. Some migrants are deterred by rising violence back in their hometowns, says Orozco.

Title: An Economic Lifeline? How Remittances From the US Impact Mexico’s Economy | Baker Institute
Content:
In 2022, remittances represented approximately 4.1% of the national GDP, an increase of 2.4 percentage points as compared to 2013 (Figure 3). These numbers show the importance of remittances in the Mexican economy, particularly in the last decade. Remittances have, in fact, surpassed foreign direct investment in Mexico, mainly since 2018 (Figure 3). This places remittances as the second largest source of income in the country, falling only below automotive industry exports.
Source Data from BANXICO, prepared by author. Another way to test the importance of remittances on the various Mexican states is by comparing them with each state’s public income. This analysis shows that remittances have, in fact, a significant weight in relation to public income. For example, remittances received by Michoacán exceeded public income, which totaled 84,016 million pesos or approximately $4.199 billion in 2021 (Table 1). The income from remittances that this state obtained was approximately $4.984 billion.
Remittances have, in fact, surpassed foreign direct investment in Mexico, mainly since 2018 (Figure 3). This places remittances as the second largest source of income in the country, falling only below automotive industry exports. Remittances also recently surpassed Mexican oil exports, ​​suggesting that the Mexican economy depends heavily on the transfer of these funds.
By the end of 2023, remittances sent by workers to low- and middle-income countries are expected to reach approximately $639 trillion dollars — about 78% of total remittances across the globe.[1] The main recipient countries include India (12.6% of the total sent), Mexico (7.5%), China (6.4%), and the Philippines (4.8%).[2] The largest source of remittances is the United States, with more than 25% of all transfers; Saudi Arabia is second with 6.6%.[3] Given the large population of Mexican immigrants — both documented and undocumented — living in the United States, it is unsurprising that Mexico receives a high percentage of the remittances from the U.S.

Yet, as Erica Flock and others have noted, Wisconsin is not the only state in which Democrats – these days the party of the environment, if largely by default – have touted counterproductive spending on bigger roads and bridges. Early signs this election cycle suggest that, despite Democrats’ outspoken opposition to President Trump’s denial of climate change, things don’t seem to be getting much better.
“There are some groups out there that want to spend billions and billions and billions of dollars on more, bigger, wider interchanges across the state,” Walker said, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. “I actually think we should be fixing and maintaining our infrastructure.
Walker’s evolution is likely the result of anti-tax election year politics and an outgrowth of years of dedicated work by a broad coalition of groups, led by WISPIRG, 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, Sierra Club and the faith group WISDOM, along with many others, which challenged the expansion projects and shifted the transportation conversation in Wisconsin. Those groups also celebrated a victory late last year when Gov. Walker pulled the plug on the proposed billion-dollar expansion of I-94 East-West in Milwaukee – a boondoggle we criticized in Fork in the Road and that the coalition had fought for many years.
The federal gas tax has lost 40 percent of its value since it was last raised a quarter-century ago, but the federal government has not cut highway spending to match. It’s the same story in many states, which have used a variety of strategies to keep the bulldozers humming: taking money from other portions of state budgets, launching public-private partnerships, and – as my colleague Gideon Weissman described in our recent Highway Boondoggles 4 report – loading up on debt.

This isn’t the first time in recent history that spending bills disguised as infrastructure bills have been criticized in this way. In 1998, President Clinton and Congress worked together on a $217 billion transportation bill.
These highway bills remain in place for several years, and permit the federal government to distribute aid to states for numerous transportation programs. While these bills are considered regularly, there is always extensive debate around spending levels, earmarks, waste, and “unrelated” spending. Below are a few recent examples. President Bill Clinton and congressional leaders came together on a six-year, $217 billion transportation bill.
In 2005, President George W. Bush signed SAFETEA-LU, a four-year, $286 billion transportation bill. It reportedly earmarked funding for 6,000 lawmaker projects, and critics call it a “bloated, expensive bill.”
President Bill Clinton and congressional leaders came together on a six-year, $217 billion transportation bill. It included a reported 1,850 separate earmarks for individual projects – a sharp increase from the 538 included in the 1991 highway legislation. In the face of criticism and ridicule related to the inclusion of so many earmarks, the legislation referred to these costly mandates as “high priority” projects. In this bill, the high priorities included things such as bike paths and upgrades to an interpretive music center.

Governor Walker and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rightly withdrew their support for the project in 2017, and we would strongly object to any renewed effort to revive this wasteful, harmful expansion. A renewed attempt at widening 3.5 miles of this interstate would ultimately come at a cost of more than a billion dollars to taxpayers and occur against the wishes of many community members.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION provided revolves around transportation spending and infrastructure projects in Wisconsin, particularly in relation to Scott Walker, a former Wisconsin governor. 

Information 1 is a PolitiFact article that discusses a 1998 transportation spending bill, which became a central issue in the 2010 GOP gubernatorial primary. According to the article, Scott Walker, then a state lawmaker, opposed the bill, as did U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner. Mark Neumann, Walker's opponent, voted for the bill.

Information 2 is an article discussing Scott Walker's evolution on transportation issues. It mentions that Walker initially supported bigger roads and bridges but later shifted his stance to focus on fixing and maintaining existing infrastructure. The article credits a coalition of groups, including WISPIRG, 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, Sierra Club, and WISDOM, for challenging expansion projects and shifting the transportation conversation in Wisconsin.

Information 3 appears to be a description of C-SPAN's video archive, which is not directly relevant to the CLAIM.

Information 4 is an article from Americans for Prosperity that discusses the history of wasteful infrastructure spending. It mentions the 1998 transportation bill signed by President Clinton, which included 1,850 earmarks for individual projects, as well as subsequent transportation bills signed by President George W. Bush.

Information 5 is a letter from a coalition of organizations urging decision-makers to prioritize investments in public transportation and local road maintenance, and to reject new highway expansion projects in Wisconsin's transportation spending plan. The letter opposes the expansion of I-94 East-West in Milwaukee, which was previously withdrawn by Governor Walker and the Federal Highway Administration.

Now, to evaluate the correctness of the CLAIM:

The CLAIM states that Scott Walker opposed the 1998 transportation bill and the $9 billion of wasteful spending. Based on the available INFORMATION, it appears that this CLAIM is TRUE. Information 1 directly supports the CLAIM, stating that Scott Walker, then a state lawmaker, opposed the 1998 transportation spending bill. Additionally, Information 2 provides context for Walker's evolution on transportation issues, suggesting that he may have initially supported bigger roads and bridges but later shifted his stance to focus on more practical and cost-effective solutions. While the other INFORMATION pieces do not directly address the CLAIM, they do provide a broader context for transportation spending and infrastructure projects in Wisconsin, which supports the idea that Walker may have opposed the 1998 transportation bill.

Responding to Walter Mondale's admission in the 1984 United States presidential election debate that if he were elected taxes would likely be raised, Bush also implied that tax increases might be necessary in the next four years. Reagan asserted that he had no plans to raise taxes in his second term, and Bush quickly argued that he had been misunderstood. Bush's statements led some conservatives to begin doubting Bush's dedication to tax cuts.
It was not some liberal Democrat who said 'Read my lips: no new taxes,' then broke his word to cut a seedy backroom budget deal with the big spenders on Capitol Hill." Buchanan subsequently made extensive use of the 1988 quotation in his New Hampshire campaign, repeating it constantly in both television and radio commercials. Buchanan won a surprising 40% of the vote in New Hampshire, a major rebuff to the President.
The tax reversal played a central role in reducing the public's opinion of Bush's character. Despite the variety of scandals that affected Clinton during the election, polls showed the public viewed Clinton and Bush as similar in integrity. Even after the election, Clinton feared similar retribution from voters for raising taxes.

Fetterman authored a bill this year requiring tax collectors to tell residents if state legislators were raising school property taxes. The bill was never heard. "We had some folks in Tallahassee beating their chest, and nearly breaking their arms, shouting about the largest tax cut in Florida history," Fetterman said. "Then they turned around and forced local governments, specifically school boards, to increase taxes. I am tired and fed up -– as are most of my constituents -– of the saying of one thing and the doing of another thing in Tallahassee."
In an interview with PolitiFact this week, Rubio offered two rebuttals: First, that he was only one member of the Legislature. And second, that he wasn't prepared to vote against the entire state budget only to make a point about the schools tax. Earlier this year, Rubio offered another explanation of his schools tax vote, saying that it wasn't a tax increase because the tax rate didn't go up.
But as you know public education funding in Florida is a partnership between the state and local school boards. The property tax is the only method of generating revenue we have given school districts." Though he voted for the increases, Rubio did attempt to replace the required local effort with an increased sales tax in 2007 as speaker. The plan went nowhere in the Legislature, and a constitutional amendment for the tax swap plan was thrown off the ballot the following year by a Florida circuit court judge.

“Non-partisan analysts are confirming this bill raises taxes on the middle class and produces no meaningful deficit reduction when gimmicks are removed and the full cost is accounted for.

Washington, D.C.--The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates the Democrats’ latest reckless tax-and-spend proposal will increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket, with more than half of the tax increases on Americans making less than $400,000 per year.  · “While Republicans’ pro-growth tax reform in 2017 reduced tax rates for all Americans in a way that increased the progressivity of the tax code and produced historic gains in job and wage growth, the Democrats’ approach to tax reform means increasing taxes on low- and middle-income Americans to fund their partisan Green New Deal,” said U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who requested the analysis.
According to JCT data, 98 percent of all tax returns filed by those in the $200,000 to $500,000 category are filed by those earning between $200,000 and $400,000, with at least three-fourths of the income in the $200,000 to $500,000 category also coming from those below $400,000, meaning it is likely that at least half of all new tax revenue raised next year would come from those earning under $400,000.
By 2031, when the new green energy credits and subsidies provide an even greater benefit to those at higher incomes, those earning below $400,000 are projected to bear as much as two-thirds of the burden of the additional tax revenue collected that year.  · “The more this bill is analyzed by impartial experts, the more we can see Democrats are trying to sell the American people a bill of goods,” Crapo continued. “Non-partisan analysts are confirming this bill raises taxes on the middle class and produces no meaningful deficit reduction when gimmicks are removed and the full cost is accounted for.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to taxes, politics, and government policies. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. The first information piece discusses the 1988 US presidential election, where George H.W. Bush's "Read my lips: no new taxes" promise was broken, leading to a tax increase. This event affected public opinion on Bush's character and influenced subsequent elections.
2. The second information piece is about Marco Rubio's claim that he never voted to increase taxes. However, it is argued that he did vote for a schools tax increase in Florida, despite his attempts to justify it as not being a tax increase.
3. The third information piece lists various tax increases passed by Democrats in Washington State over the past 10 years, including property taxes, payroll taxes, and capital gains taxes.
4. The fourth information piece discusses voter-approval requirements for local taxes in California, highlighting that local governments generally could raise taxes without direct resident consent until 1978, when the state's voters amended the California Constitution to require approval for local tax increases.
5. The fifth information piece presents a statement from the US Senate Finance Committee, citing a non-partisan analysis that Democrats' tax proposals would increase taxes on millions of Americans, with more than half of the tax increases affecting those making less than $400,000 per year.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the claim made by Joseph Kyrillos that he never voted for a tax increase during his time in the State Legislature. The information pieces provided do not specifically mention Kyrillos or his voting record.

To accurately classify the claim, additional information about Kyrillos' voting history and legislative actions would be necessary. Without such evidence, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of his claim.

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim remains **UNVERIFIED**.

Title: The Racial Wealth Divide and US Black Billionaires » NCRC
Content:
There were nine Black Americans on the billionaires list in 2021. Two-thirds of them were in the business of entertaining people. These six individuals – Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Shawn Carter (Jay Z), Tyler Perry, Lebron James and Tiger Woods – are some of the most well-known Black individuals in the world. Ironically, the most well-known Black billionaires are also the least-wealthy among their Black billionaire peers. The wealthiest African American, Robert Smith, has an estimated net worth of $5 billion in 2021, almost twice that of Oprah Winfrey and Jay Z, who are the wealthiest Black entertainers.
The racial wealth divide for African Americans is found at every income level: Even the most elite of African Americans, the Black billionaires have little wealth compared to similarly situated white Americans. According to the Forbes 2023 Richest People in America, no African Americans are even in the top 50 wealthiest Americans and several African American billionaires don’t even qualify for the wider Forbes 400 list.
Smith’s private equity firm Vista Equity Partners focused on investing in software companies, an important component of the tech sector – from which the second- and sixth-wealthiest African Americans emerged. Two Black American billionaires are in tech and the wealthiest of the nine is in finance.
Smith’s wealth derived from the financial sector, following in the tradition of the Canadian financier Michael Lee Chin – the other Black man to crack the billionaires list the same year Johnson did. Smith’s private equity firm Vista Equity Partners focused on investing in software companies, an important component of the tech sector – from which the second- and sixth-wealthiest African Americans emerged.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The provided information discusses the racial wealth divide in the United States, specifically highlighting the underrepresentation of African Americans among the country's billionaires. According to Forbes' lists, there are only a handful of African American billionaires, including Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Shawn Carter (Jay-Z), Tyler Perry, Lebron James, Tiger Woods, and Robert Smith, among others. These individuals have made their fortunes in various industries, such as entertainment, sports, finance, and technology.

The information also notes that despite their success, African American billionaires still lag behind their white counterparts in terms of wealth. For example, Robert Smith, the wealthiest African American, has an estimated net worth of $5 billion, which is significantly lower than that of the top white billionaires.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM> based on the available information:

<CLAIM>: Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now.

Claimant: Rush Limbaugh
Publication date: April 28, 2014

Based on the provided information, the <CLAIM> can be classified as TRUE. Although the number of African American billionaires is still relatively small compared to their white counterparts, there are indeed some African Americans who are among the wealthiest Americans. The information provided lists several African American billionaires, including Robert Smith, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, and others, who have made significant fortunes in various industries.

It's worth noting that the <CLAIM> is somewhat vague, as it doesn't specify what proportion of the wealthiest Americans are African American. However, based on the available information, it is clear that there are some African Americans who are among the wealthiest Americans, which supports the <CLAIM>.

It's also important to consider the context of the <CLAIM>, which was made in 2014. At that time, the number of African American billionaires might have been even smaller than it is today. Nevertheless, the <CLAIM> still holds true, as there were already some African American billionaires who were among the wealthiest Americans.

Title: What Is Canada’s Immigration Policy? | Council on Foreign Relations
Content:
Officials granted a total of 604,382 new temporary work permits to foreigners in 2022; these include agricultural laborers, in-home caregivers, and highly skilled professionals. In 2024, the government announced that, for the first time, it will begin limiting the number of temporary foreign workers accepted into the country. The system is complex, but temporary workers generally come to Canada through one of two pathways. The International Mobility Program provides work visas to foreigners that fit broad criteria.
In 2020, a Canadian court ruled that a 2002 U.S.-Canada deal, also known as a “safe third country” agreement, that manages refugee claimants at the border was unconstitutional. Human rights organizations similarly argued that it endangered asylum seekers. However, the ruling was overturned in April 2021, and the deal remains in effect. Yet, some of Trump’s immigration actions were a boon for Canada’s economy. For example, in June 2020, his administration suspended the issuing of visas for highly skilled workers.
Meanwhile, Canada is also experiencing a prolonged labor shortage exacerbated by a dearth of skilled workers. Its immigration system faces an array of other challenges as well, including a surge in asylum claims, rising deportations, and labor abuses against temporary-visa holders.
While some skilled temporary workers eventually gain permanent residency, low-wage laborers generally cannot. Canada’s geography—bordered by three oceans and the United States, which is itself a magnet for immigrants—has helped Ottawa limit flows of undocumented people. Its highly regulated immigration system, including some of the world’s strictest visitor-visa requirements, is designed to further curb this phenomenon.

Title: Canada raises immigration bar, leaving skilled workers out in the cold | Financial Post
Content:
“Now the government is saying we are putting Statistics Canada’s research aside and we just want to prioritize these six categories,” he said. “Is that what Canada wants to do from an immigration point of view? That’s an open debate. I think this is a question that we really need to explore.
Aside from the skill-based federal immigration programs, the provincial streams also seem to be facing issues. Provinces can nominate someone for entry based on their needs through the Provincial Nomination Program. Once nominated, an applicant can receive 600 points that are then added to the person’s Express Entry score, making it easier to pass the cutoff.
But he wouldn’t have had to depend on this “drastic move” had he scored the required number of points needed for a temporary resident to become a permanent Canadian resident, a figure that seems to have been out of reach for thousands in the past year. There are many immigration programs in Canada, but most temporary residents and foreigners living outside the country either immigrate as skilled workers or get nominated by a province.
“This is the premium talent that countries want and they will now choose to go elsewhere.” · The government seems to be aware of this and has announced a number of work-permit extensions in the past that allowed newcomers to stay beyond the typical three-year work permit after completing their educational degrees. Former immigration minister Sean Fraser announced an 18-month extension last year. Current minister Marc Miller announced an extension for 6,700 workers in Manitoba in early May.

Title: Canada's New Tech Talent Strategy Takes Aim at High-Skilled Immigrants in the United States
Content:
Canada’s Tech Talent Strategy is highly unusual for its explicit targeting of visa holders in another country. Opening a dedicated stream specifically for high-skilled immigrants in the United States who hold an H-1B visa is the latest salvo in a growing global competition for talent—one in which some countries are racing ahead of the United States in terms of policy dynamism, as this commentary explores.
But unlike the United States, countries including Australia, Canada, and Germany also offer a dedicated pathway for their international students to transition to work and stay on a longer-term basis after graduation. The main avenue for international graduates of U.S. universities to begin work in the United States is the H-1B visa. Yet these graduates must compete for the same 65,000 annual new H-1B visas with other foreign workers (20,000 additional H-1B visas are set aside for applicants who earned a U.S. graduate degree, giving foreign students just a small leg up; some additional new visas are available outside the cap).
It is one thing to recruit talent; it is another to retain it, as illustrated by Canada’s attempt to attract H-1B visa holders and marketing efforts by other countries, Australia and Switzerland included, to woo foreign graduates of U.S. universities and other international talent. International students represent an attractive pool for future skilled talent, given they possess degrees from host-country institutions, language proficiency, and cultural experience: all qualities that are readily recognized by local employers. Close to 6.4 million students pursued higher-level education abroad in 2020, up from 4 million in 2011, with nearly half enrolled in seven countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Canada, France, and China.
Some countries have expanded pathways for immigrants with in-demand skills, whether by creating new visas, expanding existing pathways, or behind-the-scenes tweaks to make it easier to apply for and receive visas. Germany, for example, estimates it will need an additional 400,000 immigrants per year to meet labor market needs.

Title: Economic impact of immigration to Canada - Wikipedia
Content:
In 2015, it ranked 9th among Western countries based on the percentage of immigrants in its population, with Liechtenstein ranking first. The per capita immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s. However, in the first and second decades of the 21st century, there was a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada.
This drop occurred during the 1990s and early 2000s despite the percentage of immigrants arriving with degrees in the economic class (including principal applicants, spouses, and dependents) rising from 29% in 1992 to 56% in 2003. Stating an intention to reduce a backlog of immigration applicants of all classes, and to better target the required skills needed in Canada, the federal government passed a law in 2008 that gave the immigration minister new powers to alter immigrant selection.
Across Canada, people have been asking the government to match affordable housing to the set immigration levels, while the government annually welcomes 500,000 new permanent residents, and more than 800,000 foreign nationals into the country on study visas, as asylum seekers, and on temporary work visas. A Canadian journalist highlighted the poor preparedness for receiving immigrants in swathes, pointing to Canada's historic need for a "servant class" and "cheap labor" for bourgeoisie and the owning class.
In 2011, the unemployment rate of recently arrived immigrants was 13.6%, considerably above the native Canadian average of 5.5%. For more established immigrants, the rate fell to 8.2% Higher rates of unemployment and lower wages combine to give newcomers less income than the Canadian average. An analysis of Longitudinal Immigration Database by Statistics Canada showed that immigrants who landed in 2014, had a median income of $24,000 in 2015, compared to an income of $36,000 for native-born Canadians.
Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse. A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services.

Summary of INFORMATION:

The provided information relates to Canada's immigration policies, programs, and statistics. Here's a concise summary:

* Information 1: Canada's immigration system is complex, with temporary foreign workers entering through the International Mobility Program or other pathways. The country faces labor shortages, asylum claims, and labor abuses against temporary-visa holders.
* Information 2: Canada has various immigration programs, including the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program, Caregivers Program, Federal Business programs, Provincial Nominee Program, and Quebec Skilled Worker Program, among others.
* Information 3: Canada has raised the bar for immigration, making it more challenging for skilled workers to enter the country. The government has prioritized certain categories, and provinces can nominate candidates through the Provincial Nomination Program.
* Information 4: Canada's Tech Talent Strategy targets high-skilled immigrants in the United States, particularly those with H-1B visas. The country aims to attract international talent, including students who have graduated from U.S. universities.
* Information 5: The economic impact of immigration to Canada is significant. The country has a relatively constant per capita immigration rate, and the education and skill level of immigrants have increased over the years. However, there are concerns about the preparedness of the country to receive large numbers of immigrants.

Evaluation of the <CLAIM>:

The claim states that Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs, while the United States sets aside 6 percent. Based on the provided information, it is challenging to verify the exact percentage of visas allocated for skilled workers in Canada. However, we can infer some insights from the information:

* Information 2 lists various immigration programs in Canada, including those focused on skilled workers, business immigration, and provincial nominations. This suggests that Canada has a significant proportion of visas allocated for skilled workers and those who can contribute to the country's economy.
* Information 3 mentions that the government has prioritized certain categories for immigration, which might imply that a significant percentage of visas are allocated for skilled workers who meet specific criteria.
* Information 4 highlights Canada's efforts to attract high-skilled immigrants, particularly from the United States. This suggests that Canada is actively seeking to attract skilled workers who can contribute to the country's economy.

However, without specific data or statistics on the exact percentage of visas allocated for skilled workers in Canada, it is difficult to verify the claim. The claimant, Michael Bloomberg, made this statement in 2010, and immigration policies and programs may have changed since then.

Based on the available information, I would classify the <CLAIM> as UNVERIFIED. While the information suggests that Canada has a significant focus on attracting skilled workers, the exact percentage of visas allocated for this purpose is unclear.

Garcia endorses the political construct that the U.S. continue to allow Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba to visit family, and that other Americans to go there for "purposeful travel", such as educational tours and religious missions.
Garcia's campaign raised over $1.8 million but incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart defeated Garcia 53%-47%. This 6% lost is easily the closest that a Democrat has come to defeating one of the Díaz-Balart brothers in a Congressional election.
Garcia joined other Cuban lawmakers in submitting a letter to the State Department calling for Cuba to remain a designated state-sponsor of terrorism. And in a Sept. 19 letter, he joined with the other three Cuban-American House members by raising concerns over the regime's involvement in selling art at a Houston art fair.
Garcia served on the Florida Public Service Commission as chairman. While on the FPSC, he chaired the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and was second vice chair of the Southeastern Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. Garcia was later appointed to the Federal Communications Commission Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service and was a member of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
In January 2014, Garcia proposed legislation that would halt flood insurance rate hikes for five years. His efforts stem from previous legislation that once in place would hit 268,000 Floridians with rate increases of between 20 and 400 percent. The Miami Herald reported that the bill would apply to all "property owners covered by the National Florida Insurance Program, and provides the greatest relief to those hardest hit—including an estimated 47,000 in Miami-Dade County."

Two days later, her husband, Joe Garcia, suffered a fatal heart attack — moments after returning home from a trip to a memorial set up for the victims. He had taken flowers to honor his wife, another schoolteacher and 19 students who lost their lives. Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland victims' families spoke to The Post about their shared grief, trauma and hope for action following the Texas school shooting.

Martinez said authorities told his family that Irma Garcia used herself as a human shield to try save the children. “I want her to be remembered as someone who sacrificed her life and put her life on the line for her kids,” he told The Post this week. “They weren’t just her students. Those were her kids, and she put her life on the line, she lost her life to protect them. That’s the type of person she was.” · By Thursday, her husband had also died. Martinez said Joe Garcia, 50, was in the kitchen when he fell over and Martinez’s mother started performing chest compressions until paramedics arrived.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to Joe Garcia, a politician who has served on the Florida Public Service Commission and in the US Congress.

Information 1 from PolitiFact states that Joe Garcia, as a commissioner on the Florida Public Service Commission between 1994 and 2000, took votes in favor of utility rate increases. This is the basis for the claim that Garcia "voted to raise our utility rates."

Information 2 from Wikipedia provides background information on Joe Garcia, including his tenure on the Florida Public Service Commission, where he served as chairman. It also mentions his efforts to halt flood insurance rate hikes for five years.

Information 3 from OpenSecrets explains how campaign finance data is collected and reported, including contributions from corporate PACs, employees, and owners.

Information 4 from Kendall Community News recommends Joe Garcia for US Congress, highlighting his achievements, including successfully lowering power bills for Floridians and working to cut energy bills for American families.

Information 5 from The Washington Post is unrelated to Joe Garcia's political career, reporting on a tragic event where a teacher, Irma Garcia, was killed in a school shooting, and her husband, Joe Garcia, died of a heart attack shortly after.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families" made by David Rivera on September 29, 2010, can be classified as **TRUE**.

The evidence supporting this classification comes from Information 1, which states that Joe Garcia, as a commissioner on the Florida Public Service Commission, took votes in favor of utility rate increases. This suggests that Garcia did indeed raise utility rates, which would affect families. While the other pieces of information provide context about Garcia's political career and achievements, they do not contradict the specific claim made by David Rivera.

Title: New York’s economic outlook ranked worst in the nation
Content:
A conservative think tank ranked New York’s economic outlook the worst in the nation as the state tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The Empire State placed dead last on the American Legislative Exchange Council’s annual ranking for the seventh straight year largely thanks to its high taxes and hefty debts. New York and other states like neighboring Vermont and New Jersey — which filled out the bottom three — could be left behind in the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis if they don’t enact “pro-growth” policies, the report’s authors contend.
“Sound tax policy and eliminating excessive government regulations continue to stand strong and true in improving states’ competitiveness, and we hope these states’ stories serve as a guide as we navigate the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic,” co-author Arthur B. Laffer said in a statement. Utah, meanwhile, had the best economic outlook for the 13th straight year, followed by Wyoming and Idaho. The list released Wednesday judged states by 15 economic policy criteria — and New York landed among the 10 worst states for 11 of those categories including its top marginal corporate tax rate, which ALEC says is the nation’s highest at 17.26 percent.

But that was offset by the state losing 1.3 million people from 2009 to 2018, the report says.

Title: DiNapoli Analysis Finds Worrisome, Uneven Economic Recovery Among NYC's Labor Force | Office of the New York State Comptroller
Content:
By March 2022, the city recovered just under 71% of jobs lost, while the rest of New York state has regained 82% of jobs. By April 2022, the United States had regained 95%. The city’s unemployment rate remains substantially higher than the rest of the state and nation and higher than its pre-pandemic rate.
The slow recovery of pandemic job losses has left the city with an unemployment rate of 6.5%, 2.8 points higher than the February 2020 level of 3.7%, while the nation’s unemployment rate is only one-tenth of a point above its February 2020 level of 3.5%. The remainder of the state reached its February 2020 rate of 4% by October 2021. “New York City suffered heavy job losses from the shock of the pandemic shutting down many businesses in early 2020, and it has not fully regained these jobs,” DiNapoli said.
This compared to a gain of 2.3 points to reach 10.8% in the rest of the state and 0.5 points to reach 10.4% in the nation. DiNapoli notes the city and state have taken steps to support employment more broadly and have targeted support at some groups, including those employed by tourism-dependent businesses, young workers and caretakers. He encouraged city and state officials to look closely at the city’s labor force and examine whether existing policies are reaching and helping struggling communities.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles and reports published between 2020 and 2024, discussing the economic outlook and recovery of New York state and New York City. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. **Signs of Progress: NYC's Economic Recovery (2024)**: The report highlights the growth of women-owned businesses in New York state, with a 43% expansion between 2019 and 2023. It also mentions the recovery of NYC's tourism industry and forecasts moderate growth in jobs and output through 2028.
2. **New York's economic outlook ranked worst in the nation (2020)**: A conservative think tank, American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), ranked New York's economic outlook as the worst in the nation due to high taxes and debt. The report cites the state's top marginal corporate tax rate, personal income tax rate, and debt service as contributing factors.
3. **New York's economy is America's worst (2021)**: The article states that New York's GDP contracted by 5.9% in 2020, ranking it 47th out of 50 states for economic growth. The state's unemployment rate was also high at 7.8%.
4. **New York state is ranked the WORST in the country for economic outlook (2020)**: This article reports on the same ALEC ranking as Information 2, highlighting New York's poor economic outlook due to high taxation, regulation, and poor growth.
5. **DiNapoli Analysis Finds Worrisome, Uneven Economic Recovery Among NYC's Labor Force (no publication date)**: The report by the New York State Comptroller's office notes that NYC's labor force recovery has been slow, with an unemployment rate of 6.5% in April 2022, higher than the rest of the state and nation.

**Evidence and Classification of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Rob Astorino in 2014, states that New York is the "worst in the nation in economic recovery." Based on the provided information, it appears that this CLAIM was accurate at some point in time, but not consistently.

The 2020 reports (Information 2, 3, and 4) suggest that New York's economic outlook was indeed poor, with high taxes, debt, and a contracting GDP. The state's unemployment rate was also high during that period.

However, the 2024 report (Information 1) presents a more positive picture, highlighting the growth of women-owned businesses and the recovery of NYC's tourism industry. This suggests that New York's economy has made some progress since 2020.

Given the mixed evidence, I would classify the CLAIM as **PARTIALLY TRUE**. While New York's economic outlook was poor in 2020, it is not consistently the "worst in the nation" in terms of economic recovery. The state's economy has shown signs of improvement, but it still faces challenges, such as a higher unemployment rate compared to the rest of the state and nation.

In 2003 the U.S. Department of Justice characterized the settlement as “by far the largest recovery ever reached by the government in a health care fraud investigation.” Scott later moved to Florida, where he ran his own investment firm, Richard L. Scott Investments, and another health care company, Solantic Corporation, which he founded in 2001.
In 1994 it merged with the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) to form Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, and Scott became the company’s chairman and chief executive officer. The company soon became the largest for-profit hospital chain in the United States. By 1997, however, Columbia/HCA had come under criminal investigation for alleged fraudulent charges by its hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid and other government health programs.
For example, although he originally opposed plans to expand access to Medicaid in the state under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, he later supported a proposal for a three-year trial expansion of the program. The proposal was defeated in the Republican-led state legislature in 2015, and Scott thereafter abandoned the idea.

Happy Election Day, Texas! Every election cycle inevitably brings a round of endorsements from the major newspapers across the state, and examining their breakdown can help put the races into better perspective. As Texans head to the polls today (or fail to, if you consider these poor early voting numbers), let’s take a look at how some of the biggest dailies in Texas endorsed (or chose not to endorse) the 2014 candidates.
Wendy Davis is an American icon, and she’s the candidate we endorse in the race for governor of Texas.” · Now let’s break it down by total newspaper endorsements, which can serve as a fairly good indicator of who’s going to emerge victorious in each race. ... Best quote: “It’s hard to understand how two candidates with inspiring personal stories have managed to run such an uninspiring race.” – El Paso Times ...

Download it here. ... Stacks of newspapers. (AP Photo) ... UPDATED 1:50 PM CT Oct. 28, 2022 PUBLISHED 10:21 AM CT Oct. 28, 2022 PUBLISHED 10:21 AM CDT Oct. 28, 2022 ... AUSTIN, Texas — Texans are lining up to cast early voting ballots. But experts say they’re probably not looking at newspaper endorsements before they do.
I think voters worry more than ever that endorsements are indicators of bias in the news,” said Kristie Bunton, the dean of the Bob Schieffer College of Communication at Texas Christian University (TCU). Bunton said if a voter doesn’t understand that the news and editorial wings of a newspaper are separate, they might assume the papers swing left or right based on their endorsements. “It has long been the case that voters and readers don’t understand the difference between the news coverage function and the opinion and editorial function, and I think today that distinction is blurred even further for them,” Bunton said.
“So for a variety of reasons, I think people might take more seriously the small town paper endorsement in a local race than they would the big city paper making a statement about the governor’s race or the presidential race or anything like that.” · One voter carried a list of endorsements with her to the polls. She needed more information about the down-ballot races. “It’s very helpful to see those in one place,” said Colleen Hobbs, a Travis County resident.
“So the Des Moines Register has a huge and proud tradition of covering politics all over the state of Iowa, because Des Moines is the largest city in Iowa... And they’re proud of their editorial function for years, and it’s award-winning. They are down now, I believe, to two days a week of op-ed coverage because they need to channel other resources into regular news reporting. And so it becomes this cycle also of, do endorsements matter? Maybe, maybe not. And oh, by the way, are they just dying off? Because even though they’ve been around for 150 or so years, news organizations have got to put their resources in other areas.”

The Houston Chronicle's praise for Biden will be a boost for the Democrat as he seeks re-election in November. It remains to be seen how much of a difference the endorsement will make, seeing as Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for nearly 50 years, with Trump beating Biden in 2020 by six points in the red state.
A number of Republican and MAGA figures have reacted angrily after The Houston Chronicle, one of the biggest newspapers in Texas, endorsed President Joe Biden. The Houston Chronicle's editorial board said they would be backing Biden in the Democratic primary and for re-election so he can "make life better" for the American people as well as prevent the "chaos, corruption and danger to the nation" that would accompany his presumed 2024 Republican challenger Donald Trump returning to the White House.

The Houston Chronicle board did note the concerns about the age and cognitive ability of Biden, who will be 82 by the start of his potential second term in office, and said that he may not be the "energetic, garrulous, occasionally even eloquent" public speaker of previous years. However, the board suggested the president has "forgotten more than his presumed Republican rival will ever know. That's not saying much, and at the same time, it says it all." Trump's office has been contacted for comment via email.

Title: Clinton winning race for Texas newspaper endorsements by a lot | The Texas Tribune
Content:
Hurd's heated rematch against Democrat Pete Gallego has emerged as the state’s most contested congressional race. Nationwide, over 150 newspaper editorial boards have endorsed Clinton, Business Insider reports. On Sunday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial page endorsed Trump, the largest newspaper to do so.  · Editor's note: This story, originally published on Oct. 25, has been updated to add the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal's Nov.
Despite strong editorial board support for Clinton over Trump, that has not translated to such uniform support of Democrats down-ballot. Both editorial boards at the San Antonio Express-News and the El Paso Times endorsed the re-election of U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-San Antonio. Hurd's heated rematch against Democrat Pete Gallego has emerged as the state’s most contested congressional race.
6, the editorial board at the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal rallied behind Trump as well, giving the Republican presidential nominee the biggest newspaper endorsement in Texas yet just two days before the general election. “Trump is serious about his love for this country and his ability to lead. That became clear when he made the solid choice in Mike Pence as his running mate and when he listed several impressive conservative judges as possibilities for the Supreme Court,” the Avalanche-Journal's editorial board wrote. Meanwhile, several of the state's largest papers — including the Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle and San Antonio-Express News — have endorsed Clinton.
Several other Texas papers, including the Austin American-Statesman and the San Angelo Standard-Times, have said they will not endorse in this year's presidential race. On Friday, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram’s editorial board took the unusual stance of recommending voters reject Trump but abstaining from endorsing any of his opponents. “Many of his followers say they like Trump because he makes no attempt to be ‘politically correct,’” the Fort Worth Star-Telegram’s editorial board wrote.

Title: These Are the Only 6 Newspapers in the Country to Endorse Donald Trump - POLITICO Magazine
Content:
While Adelson has put his thumb on the scales with his newspaper’s endorsement, he’s been personally reluctant to give as much money as he hinted at earlier in the campaign, reserving the vast majority of his donations for down-ballot candidates through a $20 million contribution to the Senate Leadership Fund and about the same amount to the Congressional Leadership Fund. While Nevada is an important swing state, it appears to be leaning toward Clinton, and the Las Vegas paper’s support of Trump is hardly likely to change the outcome. Moon said that the reaction to the Review-Journal’s Facebook post of the endorsement “looks like the country.” “It’s very divided,” he says, “You’ve got some people who like it, some people who shared it, and some people who hate it.
“We’ve had what we thought would have been predictable given whichever point of view we would have taken on the endorsement.” · But will Trump’s only major-market endorsement make a difference?

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles related to newspaper endorsements in Texas and the United States. Here's a brief summary of each article:

1. **Information 1 (2015-08-19)**: An article from Texas Monthly discussing the major Texas newspaper endorsements for the 2014 gubernatorial election. The article highlights the endorsements of Wendy Davis by several major newspapers, including the Houston Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News.
2. **Information 2 (2022-10-28)**: An article discussing the relevance of newspaper endorsements in modern politics. Experts suggest that voters may not consider newspaper endorsements as influential due to perceived bias and the blurring of lines between news and editorial functions.
3. **Information 3 (2024-02-20)**: An article from Newsweek reporting on the Houston Chronicle's endorsement of Joe Biden for re-election in 2024. The endorsement is seen as a boost for Biden's campaign, despite Texas being a traditionally Republican state.
4. **Information 4 (2018-08-07)**: An article from The Texas Tribune discussing the newspaper endorsements for the 2016 presidential election in Texas. The article notes that Hillary Clinton received endorsements from several major Texas newspapers, while Donald Trump received fewer endorsements.
5. **Information 5 (2016-10-25)**: An article from POLITICO Magazine listing the only six newspapers in the country that endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2016.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The claim made by Barack Obama on February 21, 2008, states that he has been endorsed by "every major newspaper here in the state of Texas." Based on the provided information, this claim appears to be **FALSE**.

While Obama did receive endorsements from several major Texas newspapers, it is unlikely that he received endorsements from every major newspaper in Texas. The information provided does not support this claim, and it is possible that some newspapers may have endorsed other candidates or chosen not to endorse anyone.

In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama's opponent, Hillary Clinton, also received endorsements from several major Texas newspapers. It is possible that Obama received a majority of endorsements, but the claim that he received endorsements from "every major newspaper" is likely an exaggeration.

Title: Property Tax in Milwaukee County WI [2024 Guide] Rates, Due Date, Exemptions, Calculator, Records, Codes
Content:
Look for a firm meeting your needs in this list of the best property tax protest companies in Milwaukee County WI. If we don't reduce your property taxes, we don't get paid Request Property Tax Reduction · Granted authority by the state, district administrations conduct property taxation.
If you have to go to court, it may make sense to get service of one of the best property tax attorneys in Milwaukee County WI. It is your right to appeal your property’s tax value assessment. But, prior to starting on a long process, perhaps you should relate the valuation to dollars. Thoroughly calculate your actual property tax using any tax exemptions that you are allowed to utilize.
Taxation of properties must: [1] be equal and uniform, [2] be based on current market worth, [3] have a single appraised value, and [4] be deemed taxable if it’s not specially exempted. Appropriate communication of any levy increase is another requisite. Within those boundaries, the city establishes tax rates. Left to the county, however, are appraising property, mailing bills, making collections, enforcing compliance, and handling disputes. Real property assessments are undertaken by the county. Wisconsin also enacted rules that Milwaukee County administrators must comply with in evaluating real estate.
Along with Milwaukee County, they rely on real property tax receipts to support their operations. The variety and significance of these governmental services relying on real estate taxes can’t be overemphasized. Again, real property taxes are the single largest way your city pays for them, including over half of all public school financing. All other service categories, such as police/fire, hospitals, recreation, buses/rail, and water/sewage treatment plants, receive similar fiscal support.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information consists of four sources from the City of Milwaukee's website, all with similar content, highlighting the city's advantages for businesses, including affordable land and leasing costs, abundant fresh water, an educated workforce, low business costs, and easy access to financing, technical assistance, and efficient transportation. These factors have contributed to the success and growth of local businesses.

The fifth source is a guide to property tax in Milwaukee County, WI, which explains the process of property taxation, the role of district administrations, and the rights of property owners to appeal their tax value assessment. It also outlines the rules and regulations governing property taxation in Wisconsin.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to support the CLAIM that property tax exemptions can be granted to small businesses that move into Milwaukee County. However, the City of Milwaukee's website sources (Information 1-4) do mention "Property Tax Exemption Request" and "Property Tax Exemptions," suggesting that property tax exemptions are available, but they do not specify the eligibility criteria or the types of businesses that can apply.

The fifth source (Information 5) provides more context on property taxation in Milwaukee County, but it does not explicitly mention property tax exemptions for small businesses. It does mention that property taxation must follow certain rules, including the requirement that taxation be equal and uniform, and that certain properties may be specially exempted.

**Classification of the CLAIM:**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **UNVERIFIED**. While the City of Milwaukee's website sources suggest that property tax exemptions are available, they do not provide sufficient evidence to support the CLAIM that small businesses moving into Milwaukee County are eligible for these exemptions. Further research or clarification from the City of Milwaukee or Milwaukee County authorities would be necessary to verify the CLAIM.

Title: Hunting Park offers a preview of Rebuild - WHYY
Content:
Between 2009, when a $21 million master plan to renovate the park commenced, and 2013, when the first phase of the plan was completed, crime “went down 89 percent within a half-mile radius of the park,” Mayor Jim Kenney said in a 2016 address. (Taking a look at the underlying data analysis cited by the mayor, it appears the drop in crime was actually more like 11 percent.). The numbers have supported anecdotal reports from residents noticing a drop in prostitution and illicit drug use within the park.  (While it’s true that crime across the city was also dropping in tandem over this span, Hunting Park well outpaced the city’s overall decline in crime rates, which saw a five percent decline over a similar period.
Momentum for change picked up when the Fairmount Park Conservancy published a revitalization plan that envisioned Hunting Park as the “green anchor” and stabilizing force for the surrounding neighborhoods. Like a precursor to Rebuild, the Conservancy viewed this opportunity for investing in park infrastructure as a gateway to pursuing greater goals of improving blight and crime.
As the city begins to gear up for Rebuild — a $500 million commitment from Mayor Jim Kenney to upgrade parks, rec centers, libraries, and playgrounds — the evolving story of Hunting Park provides a window into the promise and some potential pitfalls of such a path.  ·  Prior to 2009, Hunting Park had not received a notable redesign or reinvestment since the Bicentennial in 1976.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information revolves around the revitalization of Hunting Park in Philadelphia, specifically the investment of $5 million by the City and the Fairmount Park Conservancy. The main claim is that this investment led to an 89% decrease in crime within a half-mile radius of the park over the next three years.

Information 1 and 2 are identical, citing Mayor Jim Kenney's statement about the 89% crime reduction, which was based on a Dickinson College study conducted with the Philadelphia Police and the Fairmount Park Conservancy.

Information 3 is a brief mention of the Hunting Park revitalization project, led by Sikora Wells Appel, Landscape Architecture, and cites Mayor Kenney's statement about the 89% crime reduction.

Information 4 provides more context about the revitalization project, including the Fairmount Park Conservancy's master plan and the completion of the first phase in 2013. It also mentions that crime rates in the area did decrease, but not as drastically as claimed, with an 11% reduction instead of 89%.

Information 5 is a webpage from the Fairmount Park Conservancy, detailing the Hunting Park Revitalization Project, including the investment of $4.5 million in capital projects and programs.

**Evidence and Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is evidence to support the claim that the investment in Hunting Park led to a decrease in crime rates in the surrounding area. However, the exact magnitude of the decrease is disputed.

The Dickinson College study, cited by Mayor Kenney, supports the claim of an 89% crime reduction. However, Information 4 suggests that the actual decrease was more modest, around 11%. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the claim.

Given the conflicting evidence, I would classify the CLAIM as **PARTIALLY TRUE**. While it is clear that the investment in Hunting Park had a positive impact on crime rates, the exact extent of that impact is uncertain. Further investigation and clarification of the data analysis would be necessary to determine the accuracy of the 89% claim.

"I don't have money" = right now I have no money (e.g. to pay for dinner), but I may have some tomorrow.

“Saving lives on our nation’s roadways requires teamwork – from the drivers who travel our roads to the governments that fund road work to the manufacturers, contractors and innovators involved. We must all commit to doing our part to reduce the loss of life and serious injuries on American roadways that cost an estimated $1.9 trillion last year and inflicted never-ending pain on families,” said American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA) Board of Directors Chairman Jeff Johnson.
“For our part, at ATSSA, we will not rest until we achieve the goal of zero deaths on U.S. roadways.” · The significant increase in traffic fatalities since the onset of the pandemic appears largely related to increased risks being taken by drivers. In an October 2021 report, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that “after the declaration of the public health emergency in March 2020, driving patterns and behaviors in the United States changed significantly.
Safer Speeds: Where appropriate, provide roadway features to encourage safer speeds, including traffic roundabouts and curb extensions; improved signage and dynamic speed signing at high-risk locations; education on the consequences of speeding; and increased speeding enforcement, particularly at high-risk locations.
Increasing investment in roadway safety improvements is likely to pay off in the form of reduced fatal and serious traffic crashes. The U.S. has a $146 billion backlog in needed roadway safety improvements, according to a 2017 report from the AAAFTS. The report found implementing cost-effective and needed roadway safety improvements on U.S. roadways would save approximately 63,700 lives and reduce the number of serious injuries as a result of traffic crashes by approximately 350,000 over a 20-year period.

"GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59," the sign stated in large lighted letters. "PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY." Twenty-four days into January, could that be right? This PolitiFact Georgia scribe was curious. We contacted Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, who told us the message board’s numbers were already outdated.
If previous trends continue, Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Cobb, Georgia’s most populous counties, will likely end the year with the highest percentages of roadway deaths. But the number of roadway fatalities statewide would actually be down.
But the number of roadway fatalities statewide would actually be down. ... DOT data shows that roadway deaths in the state have declined slightly year over year -- going from 1,503 in 2008 to 1,147 last year, despite there being nearly a half-million more vehicles on the road. (The state had 8.5 million registered vehicles in 2008 and just less than 9 million vehicles in 2014, according to data we obtained from the Georgia Department of Revenue).

In that same year, Georgia had the 4th greatest number of traffic fatalities (1,664) in the nation [iii], even though Georgia has the 8th largest population in the United States [iv].

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources related to roadway fatalities in Georgia. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. Information 1: The Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety provides data on traffic fatalities in Georgia, including alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, BAC reporting rates, and daytime front seat passenger vehicle occupants.
2. Information 2: A news release from TRIP (Transportation Research and Innovative Policy) reports a 20% surge in traffic fatalities in Georgia from 2019 to 2022, citing increased risks taken by drivers during the pandemic. It also mentions the need for investment in roadway safety improvements to reduce fatal and serious traffic crashes.
3. Information 3: A PolitiFact article from 2015 investigates the accuracy of a DOT sign claiming 59 roadway fatalities in Georgia. The article finds that the number is outdated and that roadway fatalities in Georgia have actually declined slightly year over year.
4. Information 4: The Georgia FY2020 Highway Safety Plan is a document from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but its content is not provided.
5. Information 5: The Georgia Department of Public Health reports on motor vehicle crashes, stating that in 2020, Georgia had the 4th highest number of traffic fatalities in the nation, with 1,664 deaths.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states "GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59 PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY" and is attributed to the Georgia Department of Transportation with a publication date of January 24, 2015.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the CLAIM is likely **FALSE**. Information 3 from PolitiFact Georgia suggests that the number 59 is outdated and incorrect, as roadway fatalities in Georgia have declined slightly year over year. Additionally, the article mentions that the number of roadway fatalities statewide would actually be down, contradicting the CLAIM.

While the CLAIM's publication date is January 24, 2015, Information 3's article is also from 2015, which suggests that the CLAIM was already outdated and incorrect at the time of its publication.

"Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January." ... By James B. Nelson October 19, 2011 · In September 2011, Gov. Scott Walker responded to disappointing employment numbers by calling lawmakers back to Madison for the second special session on jobs in the nine months since he took office. The Sept. 28, 2011 announcement came after the Department of Workforce Development reported Sept. 15, 2011 that the state lost 800 jobs in August.

Scott Walker responded to disappointing employment numbers by calling lawmakers back to Madison for the second special session on jobs in the nine months since he took office.
Promising a bipartisan effort, Walker urged lawmakers to pass some 30 bills by November. But opponents said the session on jobs was little more than political posturing.

Title: Walker leaves a fundamentally changed Wisconsin | AP News
Content:
“Governor Walker devolved power away from Madison and public sector unions, giving local governments the ability to balance their budgets and Wisconsin businesses the ability to grow and create better opportunities,” Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said in an email. “He leaves office with the tax burden at a 50-year low and unemployment near record lows, and every employer I talk to tells me there are more jobs available than there are people to fill them.” · To his critics, Walker divided and deeply scarred Wisconsin. “Scott Walker is without a question the most significant governor of Wisconsin in modern times,” said Democratic strategist and former state party chairman Mike Tate.
Walker signed into law a litany of Republican priorities. His boldest and most disputed move came right out of the gate, when he effectively eliminated public sector collective bargaining while forcing state workers to pay more for health care and pension benefits to help solve a budget shortfall. The fight over that brought protests as large as 100,000 people and made Walker a national conservative star.
Just three weeks before leaving office, Walker signed Republican legislation weakening the powers of his successor as well as the incoming Democratic attorney general. He brushed off bipartisan warnings that he was staining his legacy, saying he will be remembered for other things. He pointed to a fresh deal to save nearly 400 jobs at a Kimberly-Clark Corp. plant near Appleton.
The once-rising Republican star who made his name kneecapping public sector unions as governor of Wisconsin leaves office in defeat Monday. He was narrowly beaten by Democrat Tony Evers , the state education superintendent who marched with teachers in protest of Walker’s policies.

Tim Russell, employed by Walker in a number of posts, was implicated in the same investigation; he was charged in January 2012 and pleaded guilty in November 2012 to diverting more than $21,000 to his personal bank account. In 2010, Walker's last year as Milwaukee County executive, Russell was his deputy chief of staff and Milwaukee Housing Director. Walker was not charged with any wrongdoing. While county executive, Walker became a candidate, in February 2005, in the 2006 race for Wisconsin governor. He dropped out on March 24, 2006, after about 14 months of campaigning, citing fundraising difficulties.
Walker won the recall, his second face-off with Barrett, by a slightly larger margin (53% to 46%) than in the 2010 election (52% to 46%) and became the first U.S. governor to win a recall election. By the end of the recall election, Walker had a national network of conservative donors and groups supporting him. Nearly 300,000 people donated to his recall campaign, which garnered roughly $37 million.
He won the Republican nomination in the primary election of September 14, 2010, receiving 59% of the popular vote, while former U.S. Representative Mark Neumann garnered 39%. As part of his campaign platform, Walker said he would create 250,000 jobs in his first term through a program that would include tax cuts for small businesses, capital gains tax cuts, and income tax cuts.

Title: Wisconsin Democrats rejoice: Scott Walker is finally gone | AP News
Content:
Walker blew into office as part of a red wave in the 2010 election, with Republicans capturing control of the state Legislature at the same time. Together they enacted a host of conservative reforms, chiefly taking away nearly all collective bargaining power from teachers and other public workers as part of a fight in 2011 that put Wisconsin at the forefront of a new war over union rights. That battle that drew protests as large as 100,000 people spurred the 2012 recall, which Walker won.
And distaste over Trump’s first two years as president contributed to depressed Republican turnout, and massive Democratic votes, in key parts of Wisconsin, leading to Walker’s narrow 31,000-vote loss to state education chief Tony Evers. Republicans who worked with Walker for years as he rose from the state Assembly to Milwaukee County executive and then governor in 2010 were in shock, still trying to process the loss.
For nearly eight years, Walker delighted conservatives and frustrated liberal opponents who could never figure out the right recipe to knock him off. At one point, he was seen as a potential presidential front-runner. Trump’s entrance into the 2016 race forced Walker out. And distaste over Trump’s first two years as president contributed to depressed Republican turnout, and massive Democratic votes, in key parts of Wisconsin, leading to Walker’s narrow 31,000-vote loss to state education chief Tony Evers.
Scott Walker, beloved by Republicans for pushing through a conservative revolution but so reviled by liberals that they tried to recall him from office, warned for months that he was at risk of being overwhelmed by Democratic anger. He was right. The tide that swept him out Tuesday stalled a political career that radically transformed the purple state and helped bring about President Donald Trump’s narrow victory there in 2016. For nearly eight years, Walker delighted conservatives and frustrated liberal opponents who could never figure out the right recipe to knock him off.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, and his impact on the state's employment and economy.

Information 1 and 4 are identical, quoting State Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) stating that nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January.

Information 2 provides an overview of Walker's legacy, highlighting his achievements, such as reducing the tax burden and unemployment rates, as well as his controversial decisions, like limiting public sector collective bargaining.

Information 3 is a Wikipedia article about Scott Walker, covering his political career, including his time as Milwaukee County executive and governor, as well as his recall election and job creation promises.

Information 5 discusses Walker's departure from office, attributing his loss to depressed Republican turnout and massive Democratic votes, particularly in response to his conservative reforms and the 2011 fight over union rights.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, it appears that the CLAIM made by Mark Miller on September 28, 2011, is TRUE. The context of the CLAIM is set in September 2011, when Governor Walker responded to disappointing employment numbers by calling lawmakers back to Madison for a special session on jobs. The Department of Workforce Development had reported a loss of 800 jobs in August 2011, which supports Miller's statement.

While the other pieces of information provide a broader context about Walker's governorship and its impact on Wisconsin's economy, they do not contradict the CLAIM. In fact, Information 2 mentions that Walker left office with unemployment near record lows, but this does not necessarily negate the fact that job losses occurred during his early tenure as governor.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM "Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January" made by Mark Miller on September 28, 2011, is classified as TRUE.

Title: A Punishing Decade for School Funding | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Content:
School budget cuts make these tasks far more difficult. Teacher salaries make up a large share of public education spending, so funding cuts inevitably restrict districts’ ability to expand teaching staffs and supplement wages. In 39 states, the average teacher’s salary declined relative to inflation between the 2010 and 2016 school years (the latest year with comparable data for all states).[20] And low teacher pay is a key factor behind shortages of qualified teachers in many schools.[21]
Costs of state-funded services have risen since the recession due to inflation, demographic changes, and rising needs. For example, there are about 1.4 million more K-12 students and 1.3 million more public college and university students now than in 2008, the U.S. Department of Education estimates.[13]

Title: Public education funding in the U.S. needs an overhaul: How a larger federal role would boost equity and shield children from disinvestment during downturns

With salaries being the largest line item in school budgets, these disparities substantially affect schools’ ability to hire the educators and other school personnel needed to provide effective instruction, the school leaders to guide instructional staff, and the staff needed to support administrative needs and to offer other services and extracurricular activities. As a result, these resources vary tremendously not only among states, but within them from one district, and even school, to another.12 Overwhelming research exposes large disparities in access to counselors, librarians, and nurses, and in access to up-to-date technology and facilities.
Related to these challenges, in the aftermath of the Great Recession through the 2015–2016 school year, schools’ struggles to staff themselves increased sharply. García and Weiss (2019) showed that the share of schools that were trying to fill a vacancy but could not do so tripled from the 2011–2012 to the 2015–2016 school year (increasing from 3.1% to 9.4% of schools in that situation), and the share of schools that reported finding it very difficult to fill a vacancy nearly doubled (from 19.7% to 36.2%).19
As the Education Trust’s report on funding gaps in 2018 reveals, “School districts serving the largest populations of Black, Latino, or American Indian students receive roughly $1,800, or 13 percent, less per student in state and local funding than those serving the fewest students of color.
However, within New York (according to 2017 data), they ranged from as low as $55,976 in the low-income Finger Lakes region in the northern part of the state to nearly twice as high, $110,000, in the wealthiest Long Island districts (Malatras and Simons 2019). 13. We note that the Great Recession started as the 2007–2008 school year was underway, so we are using the term “pre-recession level” flexibly and assuming school budgets do not immediately respond to the economic recession.

Title: Schools across the country are struggling to find staff. Here’s why | PBS News
Content:
In Kansas City, the school district hired a retention coach so teachers have a point person to turn to when they are feeling overwhelmed. “They work with teachers, they can go in and work directly with the students, drop in and sub for an hour and they can find out what the teacher needs,” said Elle Moxely, public relations coordinator for Kansas City Public Schools. Like St. Louis Public Schools, Kansas City’s district plans to pay teachers more for filling in to teach classes they don’t normally teach.
But Clovis is among several school districts located in the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area that offer substitute positions, creating a competitive environment. Jager said Clovis Unified recently increased daily substitute pay to $165 and $175 a day for substitutes who stay long-term.
Bonilla said the district has so far stuck to old practices and regular expectations for teachers at the same time that teachers report dealing with added stress, less preparation time and new health protocols in the classroom. “The reason why people feel this way is because [the district] is not recognizing the reality of the situation.
Bonilla said that means teachers are taking home extra work and never fully catching up, and some teachers have reported taking sick days to do work at home. He said teachers are less worried about an increase in pay, than they are in getting the adequate amount of time to provide what educators see as quality instruction. “Long term, we’re worried that it’s creating a trust crisis on top of a health crisis,” Bonilla said by phone. “If the district leadership, and the school board superintendent, if they’re unwilling to listen, if they’re unwilling to pivot to address the needs of educators in a crisis moment and probably the deepest needs educators have ever felt, what does that say to teachers?

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to school funding, staff, and education in the United States. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. Information 1: An article from PolitiFact discusses Gov. Scott Walker's claim that the overwhelming number of school districts in Wisconsin reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-2013 state budget. The article notes that while not every district lost staff, the cumulative effect was a 5% reduction overall.

The article also mentions the challenges schools faced in staffing themselves after the Great Recession.
4. Information 4: A PBS News article discusses the struggles of schools across the country to find staff, citing examples of schools in Kansas City and Clovis that are offering incentives to attract and retain teachers.
5. Information 5: A Fast Facts report from the National Center for Education Statistics provides data on expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States, including average current expenditures per pupil and total expenditures.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is some evidence to support Gov. Scott Walker's claim that the overwhelming number of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-2013 state budget. Information 1, which is the source of the claim, notes that while there was a net drop of 3,400 education staff across more than 350 local districts, not every district lost staff, and the cumulative effect was a 5% reduction overall. This suggests that some districts may have indeed reported no change or an increase in staff.

However, the other pieces of information provide a more nuanced picture of the challenges faced by schools in terms of funding and staffing. Information 2 highlights the impact of budget cuts on school funding, while Information 3 discusses the disparities in access to resources and the struggles schools faced in staffing themselves after the Great Recession. Information 4 provides examples of schools struggling to find staff, and Information 5 provides data on expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States.

Overall, while there may be some truth to Gov. Scott Walker's claim, the broader context suggests that schools have faced significant challenges in terms of funding and staffing, which may have affected the ability of some districts to maintain or increase their staff numbers.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as PARTIALLY TRUE. While there may be some evidence to support the claim, the broader context suggests that the situation is more complex and nuanced than the claim suggests.

Title: Greg Schiano on Rutgers football’s Saturday loss: I’ was brought back here to turn a program back to what we had’
Content:
Unlike his predecessors, Schiano is able to talk like this because not only has he rebuilt a program before, he has rebuilt this very same program before. That lets Schiano stand up on Saturday night following a home loss to Rutgers where nothing went right, and speak about the direction of the program. In doing so, the most successful head coach in program history acknowledges that there will be bumps and bruises along the way. “We’re building something here.
That lets Schiano stand up on Saturday night following a home loss to Rutgers where nothing went right, and speak about the direction of the program. In doing so, the most successful head coach in program history acknowledges that there will be bumps and bruises along the way. “We’re building something here. I didn’t take this job and think it would be this linear ascent to the top. We knew what it was going to be. We’ve done it before,” Schiano told reporters after the game.
Saturday afternoon was a rough day at the office for Rutgers football and head coach Greg Schiano. In the near term, it was a tough loss and one that certainly stings. But in the long-term, Schiano talks about building a foundation for the program that extends beyond a single Big Ten loss or even this season.
Yet what Schiano speaks of is born from the truth of his own experience here at Rutgers, building a program as he has done in the past. He took over a program in 2001 that was likely the worst in college football, devoid of talent and simply a mess. In his second season, Rutgers was just 1-11, a modest step back from a 2000 season where the Scarlet Knights were 2-9 under Schiano. They had blowout losses – boy did they have blowouts.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources related to unemployment rates in Virginia. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. Governor Glenn Youngkin announces that Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to 2.7% in April, 0.1 percentage points below the previous month and 1.3 percentage points below the national rate.
2. The Virginia Department of Workforce Development and Advancement releases April 2024 unemployment rates, showing a decrease in 90 of Virginia's 133 counties and cities, with Arlington County having the lowest rate at 1.7% and Petersburg city having the highest at 4.8%.
3. An AP News article from May 2020 reports that Virginia's unemployment rate reached double digits due to the pandemic, with a significant decline in leisure and hospitality industries.
4. The Virginia Employment Commission provides data on Virginia's unemployment rate, which increased by 0.3 percentage points to 2.6% in May, with a not seasonally adjusted rate 1.1 percentage points below the national rate.
5. The Virginia Employment Commission announces that Virginia's January unemployment rate increased to 3.2%, with a labor force participation rate rising to 65.4% and employment up by 12,114.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Israel O'Quinn on August 10, 2015, states that "We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent" in terms of unemployment rates.

Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to support the CLAIM. The CLAIM is from 2015, while the provided information is from 2020 and 2024. However, Information 3 from 2020 does mention that Virginia's unemployment rate reached double digits due to the pandemic, but it does not specify counties in Southwest Virginia.

To accurately classify the CLAIM, more information from 2015 or around that time period would be needed to determine the unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia counties. Without such evidence, it is difficult to say whether the CLAIM is TRUE or FALSE.

View All Pages in National Archives Catalog View Document Transcript Although not required by the Constitution, George Washington presented the first Presidential inaugural address on April 30, 1789.
Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow- citizens at large less than either.
In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect wi
Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good; for I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted. To the preceding observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives.

About a week after arriving in Boston, he traveled north to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and circled back to New York, stopping in Waltham and Lexington. The trip was a success, serving to consolidate his popularity and improve his health. During his time in New England, Washington inspected possible sites for roads and canals and observed textile mills. After Rhode Island ratified the Constitution in 1790, Washington promptly took another tour to visit it. Along with Jefferson and New York governor George Clinton, he first stopped in Newport, Rhode Island, then traveled to Providence, Rhode Island.
After South Carolina, Washington and his party arrived in Georgia, going to (among others) Augusta. In late May, the group turned around, stopping at many Revolutionary War battle sites and the Moravian community at Salem, North Carolina. On June 11, 1791, they arrived back at Mount Vernon. Washington's Southern tour also included two stops at the location of the Federal City to negotiate purchase of land and survey the site. When the federal government began operations under the new form of government in the spring of 1789, two states—North Carolina and Rhode Island—were not yet members of the Union as neither had ratified the Constitution.
Historian John R. Alden indicates that Washington added the words "so help me God" to the oath prescribed by the Constitution. In his inaugural address (Full text ), Washington again touched upon his reluctance to accept the presidency. As the presidential election of 1792 approached, Washington, pleased with the progress his administration had made in establishing a strong, stable federal government, hoped to retire rather than seek a second term. He complained of old age, sickness, the in-fighting plaguing his cabinet, and the increasing hostility of the partisan press.
Hamilton and Jefferson had the greatest impact on cabinet deliberations during Washington's first term. Their deep philosophical differences set them against each other from the outset, and they frequently sparred over economic and foreign policy issues. With Jefferson's departure, Hamilton came to dominate the cabinet, and he remained very influential within the administration even after he left the cabinet during Washington's second term to practice law in New York City.
British officials in Upper Canada were delighted and encouraged by the success of the Natives, whom they had been supporting and arming for years, and in 1792 Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe proposed that the entire territory, plus a strip of New York and Vermont be erected into an Indian barrier state. While the British government did not take this proposal up, it did inform the Washington administration that it would not relinquish the Northwest forts, even if the U.S. paid its overdue debts.

To his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his first term. Wearied of politics, feeling old, he retired at the end of his second. In his Farewell Address, he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions. In foreign affairs, he warned against long-term alliances. Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, for he died of a throat infection December 14, 1799. For months the Nation mourned him. Learn more about George Washington’s spouse, Martha Dandridge Custis Washington.
He reported to Congress, “we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action, or put anything to the Risque, unless compelled by a necessity, into which we ought never to be drawn.” Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly, then strike unexpectedly. Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies–he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon.
Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754, he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War. The next year, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him. From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses.
On April 30, 1789, George Washington, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York, took his oath of office as the first President of the United States. “As the first of every thing, in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent,” he wrote James Madison, “it is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents may be fixed on true principles.”

In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a "more compatible use of the land." The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure.

But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan.
Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress [an] extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free.
This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, "the full power of centralized government"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people.

Here is a summary of the provided information:

Information 1: This is the text of George Washington's First Inaugural Address, delivered on April 30, 1789. In the address, Washington expresses his gratitude to the Almighty Being and acknowledges the importance of private morality and free government.

Information 2: This article from Wikipedia provides an overview of George Washington's presidency, including his tours of New England and the Southern states, his cabinet, and his relationships with other government officials.

Information 3: This article from George Washington's Mount Vernon discusses the creation of the first presidential cabinet by George Washington. It notes that the cabinet is not mentioned in the Constitution and was created by Washington as a means of responding to the challenges of governing.

Information 4: This article from The White House provides a brief biography of George Washington, including his military career, his presidency, and his retirement.

Information 5: This is a speech by Ronald Reagan, delivered on October 27, 1964, in which he criticizes government planning and the expansion of centralized government power.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM>:

"Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it's taken longer to put a Cabinet in place."

The claimant is Roy Blunt, and the publication date is February 8, 2017.

Based on the provided information, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. According to Information 3, George Washington created the first presidential cabinet as a means of responding to the challenges of governing, and it was not established by the Constitution or congressional legislation. This suggests that the formation of the first cabinet was a novel and potentially time-consuming process. Therefore, it is plausible that the first administration of George Washington would be a reference point for a slow cabinet formation process.

It's worth noting that the claim does not specify what constitutes "a time when it's taken longer to put a Cabinet in place," so it's possible that the claim is based on a specific metric or comparison that is not provided. However, based on the available information, the claim appears to be reasonable and accurate.

Here is a summary of the provided information:

Information 1 is a speech by President Biden on the third anniversary of the January 6th attack, where he emphasizes the importance of democracy, truth, and the Constitution. He expresses his optimism about America's future and its role as a beacon of democracy for the world.

Information 2 is a transcript of a speech by Donald Trump on January 10, 2021, where he encourages his supporters to march to the Capitol and cheer on senators and congressmen. He also makes claims about election fraud and criticizes weak Republicans.

Information 3 is a transcript of Donald Trump's presidential announcement speech in 2015, where he promises to bring back jobs, money, and manufacturing to the United States. He also boasts about his negotiating skills and claims he can make deals with other countries.

Information 4 is a speech by President Biden at a campaign reception in 2024, where he criticizes Trump's presidency, accusing him of lying about the pandemic and promoting chaos. He also emphasizes the importance of allowing people to come to the United States to work and contribute to the economy.

Information 5 is a speech by President Trump at the Values Voter Summit, where he talks about his administration's stance on abortion and claims that every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God. He also mentions a conversation with a general about ammunition and criticizes his opponents.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM> made by Mike Huckabee on June 5, 2007: "I'll tell you what I can tell this country: If they want a president who doesn't believe in God, there's probably plenty of choices."

Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to support or refute this claim. However, we can make some inferences. The speeches by President Biden and President Trump do not explicitly mention their personal beliefs about God, but they do make references to God and faith.

In Information 1, President Biden mentions "the sacred cause of democracy" and "We the People," which could be interpreted as a nod to the country's founding principles, including religious freedom. However, he does not explicitly express his personal beliefs about God.

In Information 5, President Trump mentions that "every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God," which suggests that he believes in God. However, this statement is made in the context of a speech about abortion, and it's unclear whether Trump is expressing his personal beliefs or simply appealing to his religious conservative base.

Given the lack of direct evidence, it's difficult to classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE or FALSE. However, it's worth noting that the claim is somewhat ambiguous and open-ended, leaving room for interpretation.

Title: Democrat John Whitmire elected Houston mayor, defeating congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee
Content:
Whitmire, 74, who is one of Texas’ most powerful Democratic legislators, will now be at the helm of America’s fourth-largest city.
Standing before a ballroom full of cheering supporters in the city’s convention center, Whitmire said he was fired up and ready to go to work as mayor. “I don’t mind telling folks what a great city we have. But we’ve got great challenges. If we will come together and realize it won’t be easy. In fact, we will face challenges. But I see that as an opportunity. And I need you to join hands with me. We’ll meet our challenges. It’ll be an opportunity to show the nation what the city of Houston can do,” Whitmire said.
Booming growth over the last decade has caused municipal headaches but has also turned the Houston area into an expanding stronghold for Texas Democrats. Although the mayoral race is nonpartisan, Whitmire and Jackson Lee are both Democrats. Whitmire will be the oldest big city mayor in the U.S. He is set to lead a city which is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35 and with 25% of its population below 18, according to census figures.
Both candidates — two of Houston’s biggest political fixtures — touted their decades-long political experience as strong qualifications to lead a growing city facing challenges that include crime, crumbling infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls. Whitmire started in the Texas Legislature in 1973, first as a state representative and the majority of his time as a state senator. Jackson Lee has represented Houston in Congress since 1995 and before that had served on Houston’s City Council.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM>:

The <CLAIM> states, "As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth." The claimant is Bill White, and the publication date is February 2, 2010.

Based on the provided INFORMATION, there is no direct evidence to support or refute Bill White's claim. However, we can infer that Bill White was indeed a mayor of Houston, as he is not mentioned in the list of mayors in Information 3, which suggests that the list may not be exhaustive.

To classify the <CLAIM>, we would need more information about Bill White's tenure as mayor and the job growth during that period. Without additional evidence, we cannot accurately determine the correctness of the claim. Therefore, the classification of the <CLAIM> remains UNCERTAIN.

Title: What are the tax penalties for Obamacare? | eHealth
Content:
Keep in mind that while the fine at the federal level has been repealed, you may still face a fine by your state government, depending on where you live. President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. This bill repealed the tax penalty mandate from the ACA. Therefore, Obamacare tax penalties are no longer in effect on a federal level as of 2019 and onwards. However, several states still mandate tax penalties for not having health insurance.
However, there are some states that still require residents to pay a fee if they don’t have health insurance. If that seems confusing, we’ll clarify it in this article. Obamacare, also commonly known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was an act signed into law in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama. This new act marked a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. This law required everyone in the United States to have health insurance coverage. Under Obamacare, people would face tax penalties if they didn’t have health insurance coverage for all or part of the year.
Under Obamacare, people would face tax penalties if they didn’t have health insurance coverage for all or part of the year. The idea behind the ACA was to increase the number of people with access to healthcare and insurance. Furthermore, another goal of Obamacare was to lower the cost of health coverage for those with lower income levels.
If the calculated penalty based on income was lower than the flat fee per individual, the individual had to pay the flat fee. For example, if an individual’s calculated penalty based on income was $200, but the flat fee per individual was $250, they would have to pay $250 as the penalty. The maximum and minimum penalty limits were designed to strike a balance between encouraging individuals to obtain health insurance coverage and ensuring that the penalty did not disproportionately affect lower-income individuals and families.

Title: Is There a Penalty for Being Uninsured in 2024?
Content:
The exemption criteria are generally similar to the exemption criteria used for the federal government's individual mandate, but there are some variations from one state to another. Vermont has an individual mandate that took effect in 2020, but the state does not impose any sort of penalty for non-compliance. Maryland created a program under which the state tax return asks about health insurance coverage, but instead of penalizing uninsured residents, the state is using the data in an effort to get these individuals enrolled in health coverage.
But in DC, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and California, the state imposes its own penalty (collected via state tax returns) if a person doesn't maintain health insurance and isn't eligible for an exemption. But nationwide, it's still wise to have health insurance. Not having coverage means health care for a serious ailment could be unaffordable or completely inaccessible. And it is generally not possible to sign up for coverage outside of open enrollment if you don't have a qualifying event (and many of the qualifying events now require the person to have already had minimum essential coverage in place before the qualifying event).

Content:
In most states, there is no longer a penalty for being without health insurance. The ACA’s federal tax penalty for not having minimum essential coverage was eliminated after the end of 2018, under the terms of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Technically, the coverage requirement is still in effect, but there’s no longer a federal penalty for non-compliance. However, some states have implemented their own health coverage requirements, with penalties for residents who don’t maintain coverage.
The legislation initially included an individual mandate and penalty that would have taken effect in 2021. But that portion of the bill was removed before passage, despite support from insurers and the Maryland Hospital Association, and the final version did not include any of the original mandate penalty language. Instead, the new law created an “easy enrollment health insurance program” that uses tax return data to identify people who are uninsured and interested in obtaining health coverage, and then connect them with the Maryland health insurance exchange (more details here, in the fiscal note).

The Massachusetts penalty only applies to adults, and the amount of the penalty is based on the person’s income and the cost of health plans available via the Massachusetts health insurance exchange (here are the details for Massachusetts penalty amounts for the 2023 tax year).

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The provided information discusses the tax penalty for not having health insurance in the United States. The federal government no longer imposes a tax penalty for not having health insurance, as the individual mandate was repealed in 2019. However, some states, including California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia, have implemented their own health insurance mandates and penalties for non-compliance.

The penalty amounts vary by state, with California imposing a penalty of up to $850 per adult and $425 per child, and Massachusetts imposing a penalty based on income and the cost of health plans available via the state's health insurance exchange.

The information also mentions that some states, like Vermont and Maryland, have implemented alternative approaches to encourage health insurance enrollment, such as using tax return data to identify uninsured individuals and connect them with health insurance exchanges.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM> made by Ron DeSantis on January 21, 2013:

"The tax penalty that the government imposes if you don't buy health insurance 'is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance.'"

Based on the available information, this claim appears to be FALSE.

At the time of the claim (2013), the federal government did impose a tax penalty for not having health insurance, and the penalty amounts were based on income and the cost of health plans. However, the claim that the tax penalty is lower than the cost of buying insurance is not supported by the information.

In fact, the information suggests that the penalty amounts were designed to encourage individuals to obtain health insurance coverage, and the maximum and minimum penalty limits were intended to strike a balance between encouraging coverage and ensuring that the penalty did not disproportionately affect lower-income individuals and families.

Furthermore, the information from 2024 suggests that in some states, the penalty for not having health insurance can be higher than the cost of buying insurance, especially for lower-income households.

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim made by Ron DeSantis in 2013 appears to be incorrect.

Most of these species were transported into the Great Lakes in the ballast water tanks of ocean-going ships. Invasive species are one of the worst problems facing the Great Lakes. Effective controls on invasive species are necessary to protect the future of Great Lakes wildlife, recreation, fisheries, and economy.

But that series of locks, dams and channels connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean also carved a pathway for foreign plants and animals to wreak billions of dollars in ecological damage to the lakes. At least 80 invasive species have arrived in the ballast water that transatlantic ships take in and discharge for balance.
More than 20 years of federal and state efforts to regulate ballast water have slowed the introduction of new species to the Great Lakes. But those regulations exempt “lakers” — hulking freighters traveling exclusively within the Great Lakes — and researchers say that helps invasive species spread after they arrive.
But those regulations exempt “lakers” — hulking freighters traveling exclusively within the Great Lakes — and researchers say that helps invasive species spread after they arrive. ___ The nonprofit news outlet Wisconsin Watch provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News. ___ Lakers can hold up to 16 million gallons of ballast water. The water helps ships maintain balance by dumping or replacing it as they deliver or take on cargo. “You would expect these ships to move invasive species, and that’s what our research shows,” said Allegra Cangelosi, a Great Lakes ballast water expert and senior researcher at Penn State University-Behrend.
Ocean-going ships called “salties” — which have been linked to introductions of 80 unwanted species to the Great Lakes — are required to take steps to curb invasives. But laker ballast water remains unregulated, making it tougher to limit damage from other invaders, researchers say. “All nature has to do is drop in a bad actor,” Cangelosi said, “and we’re sunk.” · Over the past decade, scientists have confirmed just three new species to reach the Great Lakes; none of them arrived in ballast water.

The discharge of ballast water is responsible for thousands of coastal invasions worldwide. It has been the most important cause of invasion in the Great Lakes since 1959, when the modern St. Lawrence Seaway was opened to accommodate larger ocean vessels carrying cargo.

Before the ship left its home port, water was pumped into its ballast tanks to add weight and stability to safely cross the Atlantic Ocean. The water contained larvae of an invasive freshwater mussel. After the ship passed through the St Lawrence Seaway, it discharged some of the water—and mussel larvae—at a Great Lakes port, thus introducing the zebra mussel to North America.
Effective management of the ballast water pathway is crucial to slowing the rate of invasion in the Great Lakes and protecting its resources. Here, I describe an intervention that has apparently achieved this goal.
Among the most insidious and impactful of these is invasion by non-native species. Over the past two centuries, established populations of nearly 190 non-native species of invertebrates, fishes, plants and microbes have been discovered in the Great Lakes basin. They were introduced through several sources and pathways including canals, pet release, bait bucket dumping, aquaculture escapes and—most notably—ballast water discharge from transoceanic ships.

Lawrence Seaway opened the Great Lakes to direct ocean-going shipping. Unfortunately, the ships brought new, non-native critters along for the ride in their ballast tanks. Ships need ballast water tanks to stabilize them on long ocean journeys and when loading and unloading cargo. Sixty-five percent of invasive species were released in the Great Lakes when these ships dumped their ballast water.

More than a century ago, Chicago undertook a massive engineering feat: the reversal of the Chicago River. But it had unintended consequences that are being felt today. The man-made Chicago canal connects the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes. It allows invasive species—like invasive carp—to move between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin.

Title: Aquatic Invasive Species in the Great Lakes | TNC
Content:
Aquatic invasive species may be the most significant threat to the health of the Great Lakes. Scientists estimate the Great Lakes have been invaded by more than 180 species and cost more than $200 million annually in lost revenue and prevention strategies.
Where is it from? Invasive common reed is from Europe and was likely introduced in the eastern United States via ballast waters on ocean ships in the 1800s. The nonnative plant spread into the Great Lakes basin and across most of the country.
Now government agencies and nonprofits are collaborating to prevent invasive species from getting into the lakes through routes other than ballast waters. Potential avenues include hitchhiking onto boats or people’s shoes, the release of aquarium pets or water garden plants into the lakes, the migration of species through canals that connect the basin to other watersheds and the release of live bait by anglers. TNC is working with partners to better understand these potential pathways and develop solutions to close them. Below are three examples of how we are doing this. Invasive Eurasian Watermilfoil An aggressive invader of reservoirs, rivers and lakes, this plant forms dense mats that replace native plants and prevent light penetration, destroying fish habitat.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information discusses the issue of invasive species in the Great Lakes, specifically focusing on the role of ballast water in introducing non-native species to the region. Here's a summary of each piece of information:

1. Invasive species have been a significant problem in the Great Lakes since the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened in 1959, with 85 invaders discovered, and 54 linked to ballast water discharge.
2. Despite regulations, "lakers" (freighters traveling exclusively within the Great Lakes) are exempt from ballast water regulations, which may contribute to the spread of invasive species.
3. Ballast water management has been effective in reducing the flow of invasive species into the Great Lakes, with only three new species introduced in the past decade, none of which arrived via ballast water.
4. The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 allowed ocean-going shipping to access the Great Lakes, introducing non-native species through ballast water, with 65% of invasive species released into the Great Lakes through this pathway.
5. Aquatic invasive species are a significant threat to the Great Lakes, with over 180 species introduced, costing over $200 million annually in lost revenue and prevention strategies.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn't ballast water" by Steve Latourette (November 4, 2011) appears to be **FALSE**.

The evidence suggests that ballast water has been a significant pathway for invasive species to enter the Great Lakes, with multiple sources citing the importance of ballast water management in reducing the flow of invasive species. While it is true that other pathways, such as canals, pet release, and bait bucket dumping, also contribute to the introduction of invasive species, the information provided emphasizes the importance of ballast water as a key factor in the problem.

In particular, Information 3 and 4 highlight the effectiveness of ballast water management in reducing the introduction of new invasive species, and Information 1 and 5 emphasize the significant impact of ballast water on the introduction of invasive species in the Great Lakes.

Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that ballast water remains a significant problem in the introduction of invasive species in the Great Lakes, contradicting the CLAIM.

The individual scores account for a host of variables, including mortality, dependence, drug-related family adversities, environmental damage, and effect on crime. Even if two drugs score similarly in Nutt's analysis, the underlying variables behind the scores can be completely different. For instance, heroin and crack cocaine are fairly close in the rankings.

CJNG is lesser known but just as powerful. The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, published an investigative report in 2019 on El Mencho's reach into small-town America, with known cases in 35 states — including those far from the border, such as Kentucky, Kansas, South Carolina and Massachusetts.
— On the streets, they're called "trash cans" — colorful capsules or vials packed haphazardly with fentanyl, an opioid so potent that just a tiny amount can kill. Drug agents have found them in Baltimore, New Jersey and Philadelphia, and they fear this new drug threat could soon spread across the nation. "Trash cans" are packaged in U.S. conversion labs — homes or buildings where traffickers alter or remix drugs they buy in bulk and package for resale. Sometimes, traffickers cut fentanyl with other drugs, even animal tranquilizers.
Police are finding the emptied vials tossed on the ground and this can pose a danger if enough of the drug remains in or on the vial. Users also face a significant risk when snorting or ingesting the drugs, since an amount of fentanyl as small as Abraham Lincoln's cheek on a penny can kill.

For C. diff this is a life-threatening infection associated with 14,000 deaths and a quarter of a million hospitalizations per year.

They show us that if we're not careful and if we don't take action urgently, the medicine cabinet may be empty for patients with life-threatening infections in coming months and years. But we do see a real ray of hope in the effective interventions that can prevent and reverse drug resistance.
We're seeing a widespread adoption of that system and use of the information to feedback to hospitals and identify ways to improve performance. In terms of tracking of drug-resistant infections, we're expanding systems to do that, not only NHSN, but health-wise in the president's budget proposal for fiscal '14, there is a proposal to expand the advanced molecular detection initiative, that would allow us to track this in much closer to real-time.

Following State law, they drew lots for a winner. The candidates put their names on individual pieces of paper and put the pieces in a bowl. A neutral third party pulled a name out of the bowl and that candidate was declared the winner.  · A very close finish could also result in a run-off election or legal action to decide the winner.

So now we know definitively, the presence of the master lever on our ballot injures Rhode Island voters, and thus our democratic system. So what can you do? Join the movement to eliminate the master lever by signing up at masterlever.org and contacting your members of the General Assembly.
As they write, “Voters who use a straight-party option have fewer unintentional undervotes for partisan offices, especially when multiple candidates are to be selected, but they commit as many or more errors of omission in nonpartisan races.” [emphasis added]* So now we know definitively, the presence of the master lever on our ballot injures Rhode Island voters, and thus our democratic system.
We have long suspected that the use of the so-called master lever was a problem for Rhode Island voters. The option of casting a ballot for all partisan races with a single mark, while seemingly convenient, we suspected to result in a severe undervote for nonpartisan races. Numerous cities and towns have councils and school committees that run without party labels. When using the master lever we suspect thousands of voters are skipping right over those races, causing what is referred to as an undervote.
Until recently we could not prove that this was happening. Rhode Island does not allow access to voted ballots, despite several access to public records attempts on our part. Fortunately several leading political scientists looked at the impact of ballot design, and specifically the presence of the straight party option on the ballot, and confirmed our suspicions.

And that the people who miss the most errors are the least educated – proof to me that op scan machines discriminate against those of us who are not as well-educated as others.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

Information 1: This article from the National Archives provides answers to frequently asked questions about presidential elections, including the process of verifying a candidate's qualifications, what happens if a president-elect fails to qualify, and how electoral votes are counted. It also mentions that in close elections, a recount or run-off election may be necessary, and that objections to electoral votes can be raised in Congress.

Information 2: This article from the Smithsonian discusses the history of voting machines, specifically the gear-and-lever machine invented by Alfred J. Gillespie in the late 1890s. The machine offered privacy and limited one man to one vote, and was used in a town election in Rochester, New York in 1898.

It mentions that white men with property were initially the only ones allowed to vote, but that over time, other groups such as white men without property, African Americans, women, and others gained the right to vote.

Information 4: This article from Common Cause Rhode Island argues that the "master lever" option on ballots, which allows voters to cast a single vote for all partisan races, can lead to unintentional undervotes in nonpartisan races. The article cites a study that found that voters who use the straight-party option commit as many or more errors of omission in nonpartisan races.

Information 5: This article from The New York Times discusses the pros and cons of different types of voting machines, including lever machines and electronic machines. The author argues that lever machines are reliable and should be kept as a safeguard for democratic voting rights.

Now, to evaluate the <CLAIM>:

The <CLAIM> states that there is nothing in the voting instructions that informs voters about the limitations of the master lever. Based on the information provided, it appears that the claim is TRUE.

Information 4 specifically discusses the limitations of the master lever, including the potential for unintentional undervotes in nonpartisan races. However, it does not mention that this information is typically included in voting instructions. In fact, the article suggests that voters may not be aware of these limitations, which could support the claim that the information is not typically included in voting instructions.

Additionally, none of the other information provided suggests that voting instructions typically include information about the limitations of the master lever. Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that the claim is TRUE.

The Department of Defense (DOD) is incorporating training for servicemembers separating or retiring from the military on potential targeting of those with military training by violent extremist actors. The U.S. Government will improve public awareness of federal resources to address concerning or threatening behavior before violence occurs. The U.S. Government will augment its efforts to address online terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence by domestic terrorists through increased information sharing with the technology sector and the creation of innovative ways to foster digital literacy and build resilience to recruitment and mobilization.
It is organized around four pillars – the core elements of how the Biden Administration will improve the U.S. Government’s response to this persistent, evolving, and lethal threat to our people, our democracy, and our national security: PILLAR 1: UNDERSTAND AND SHARE DOMESTIC TERRORISM-RELATED INFORMATION
DOD, DOJ, and DHS are similarly pursuing efforts to ensure domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks and improve screening and vetting processes. Training and resources will be developed for state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners as well as sensitive private sector partners to enable them to enhance their own employee screening programs and prevent individuals who pose domestic terrorism threats from being placed in positions of trust.

Title: The Efficacy and Ethics of U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy | Wilson Center
Content:
One year after the death of bin Laden, the White House’s top counter-terrorism expert John Brennan discussed the Administration’s ongoing efforts to destroy al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as the standards and practices behind those efforts. In this Director's Forum, Brennan acknowledged the use of drone strikes against terrorists, and targeted killings overseas.
And we constantly work to improve and refine our efforts so that we are doing everything in our power to prevent the loss of innocent life. This too is a reflection of our values as Americans. Ensuring the ethics and efficacy of these strikes also includes regularly informing appropriate members of Congress and the committees who have oversight of our counterterrorism programs.
He pledged to share as much information as possible with the American people “so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.” He has consistently encouraged those of us on his national security team to be as open and candid as possible as well. Earlier this year, Attorney General Holder discussed how our counterterrorism efforts are rooted in, and are strengthened by, adherence to the law, including the legal authorities that allow us to pursue members of al-Qaida, including U.S. citizens, and to do so using technologically advanced weapons.
Finally, when he became President Obama’s point person on counterterrorism strategy, and when the Wilson Center commenced a series of programs which as still ongoing, the first of which we held on 9/12/2011 to ask what the next 10 years should look like, and whether this country needs a clearer legal framework around domestic intelligence. Clearly, the success story of the past decade is last May’s takedown of Osama bin Laden. At the center of that effort were the senior security leadership of our country.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to counterterrorism efforts and the role of Congress in being informed about these efforts.

Information 1 is an article from PolitiFact that questions whether President Obama's administration has kept Congress "fully informed" of its counterterrorism efforts, specifically regarding the use of drones to locate and kill suspected terrorists overseas.

Information 2 appears to be a section from a Congressional document, outlining various provisions related to counterterrorism, including the sense of Congress condemning discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans, and the establishment and maintenance of intelligence relationships to acquire information on terrorists and terrorist organizations.

Information 3 is a brief statement from Congress explaining the USA PATRIOT Act, which aims to give law enforcement officials the flexibility and resources to eradicate acts of terrorism while protecting citizens' rights.

Information 4 is a fact sheet from the White House, dated June 15, 2021, outlining the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. The strategy provides a framework for understanding and sharing domestic terrorism-related information, preventing recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupting and deterring domestic terrorism activity, and confronting long-term contributors to domestic terrorism.

Information 5 is a summary of a Director's Forum at the Wilson Center, where John Brennan, the White House's top counter-terrorism expert, discussed the Administration's efforts to destroy al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as the standards and practices behind those efforts. Brennan acknowledged the use of drone strikes against terrorists and targeted killings overseas, and emphasized the importance of informing Congress and the American people about these efforts.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, it appears that the Obama administration has made efforts to inform Congress about its counterterrorism efforts, including the use of drones and targeted killings overseas. Information 1 and 5 suggest that the administration has regularly informed appropriate members of Congress and committees with oversight of counterterrorism programs. Information 2 and 3 indicate that Congress has been involved in shaping counterterrorism policies and laws, such as the USA PATRIOT Act.

However, it is unclear whether the administration has kept Congress "fully informed" of its efforts, as claimed by President Obama. The phrase "fully informed" implies a high level of transparency and disclosure, which may not be entirely supported by the available information.

Therefore, based on the evidence, I would classify the CLAIM as **PARTIALLY TRUE**. While the Obama administration has made efforts to inform Congress about its counterterrorism efforts, it is unclear whether these efforts constitute "fully informing" Congress.

Title: Ron Paul Thinks FEMA is the Real Disaster
Content:

Ron Paul (R-Texas) stood by his controversial belief that the federal government should reduce its role in disaster [...]
With reports that Hurricane Irene killed at least 20 people, knocked out power to more than 2 million homes and businesses and left many towns flooded over the weekend, presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stood by his controversial belief that the federal government should reduce its role in disaster relief. In an interview on Fox News, Paul argues against the very existence of FEMA.
FEMA has been under considerable scrutiny since its ineffective response to Hurricane Katrina victims in New Orleans. Some people have referred to it as the "secret government" of the United States. It is not an elected body, it does not involve itself in public disclosures, and it even has a quasi-secret budget in the billions of dollars.
Paul stressed that FEMA was in big trouble financially, noting that their flood relief program was $20 billion in debt and cast doubt that additional emergency funds could be found for FEMA. So far in 2011, FEMA has responded to “major disasters” 65 times, among the highest in the agency's history. The unprecedented demand has stretched the agency and its budget increasingly thin.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information revolves around Ron Paul's stance on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the context of Hurricane Irene in 2011. Multiple sources, including Maureen Dowd's op-ed column, report that Ron Paul advocated for reducing the federal government's role in disaster relief and criticized FEMA's effectiveness.

Information 1 and 2 are identical, citing Maureen Dowd's column, which states that Ron Paul insisted FEMA should be shut down, calling it a "giant contributor to deficit financing."

Information 3 is also identical to Information 1 and 2, reiterating Maureen Dowd's claim.

Information 4 presents a contrasting view, with Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin defending FEMA's response to Hurricane Irene and inviting Ron Paul to visit Vermont to see the agency's efforts firsthand. Ron Paul is quoted as saying that FEMA does more harm than good, adding to the federal deficit, and dictating what people can and cannot do during disasters.

Information 5 provides additional context, highlighting Ron Paul's controversial stance on FEMA, which he believes should be reduced or abolished. Paul cites FEMA's financial troubles, including a $20 billion debt in its flood relief program, and expresses doubt about securing additional emergency funds.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the provided information, it appears that Ron Paul did indeed express criticism towards FEMA and advocated for reducing its role in disaster relief. While he may not have explicitly stated that FEMA should be "shut down," his comments suggest a strong dissatisfaction with the agency's effectiveness and financial management.

Maureen Dowd's claim, as reported in Information 1, 2, and 3, is partially supported by Ron Paul's statements in Information 4 and 5. However, it is essential to note that Ron Paul's exact words are not provided in the claim, and it is unclear whether he explicitly said FEMA should be "shut down."

Given the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **MOSTLY TRUE**, as it accurately reflects Ron Paul's critical stance towards FEMA, but may not precisely capture his exact words or intentions.

Title: John Boehner’s Plan B would raise taxes on the poor - The Washington Post
Content:
The Tax Policy Center hasn't projected the distributional effect of extending the AOC, but it has estimated those effects for the stimulus expansions of EITC and CTC: The working poor, on average, would see taxes go up between $1,000 and $1,500 dollars. Barely anyone making over $100,000 would see a tax increase, and as a percentage of income, middle and upper middle class people making between $40,000 and $100,000 a year would see taxes go up less. But low income families earning $10,000 to $30,000 a year really take a beating under Boehner's plan.
Nor does it extend the stimulus's expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), by far the most important anti-poverty program the federal government has, or the American Opportunity Credit (AOC), which provides tuition assistance for middle-class families. That has a huge impact on lower-income families. The Tax Policy Center hasn't projected the distributional effect of extending the AOC, but it has estimated those effects for the stimulus expansions of EITC and CTC: The working poor, on average, would see taxes go up between $1,000 and $1,500 dollars.

Details keep coming in about "Plan B," House Speaker John Boehner's proposal to extend the Bush tax cuts for income under $1 million permanently. A lot gets extended. The current very low estate tax rates are made permanent, and the phase-out of the personal exemption for high earners, and the "Pease" limit on high earners' itemized deductions, are completely eliminated.
While the bill makes permanent the expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) signed into law by George W. Bush as part of the 2001 tax cut deal — which bumped the credit from $500 to $1,000 — it does not extend an expansion that was passed as part of the 2009 stimulus package, and has been renewed since then, allowing poor families to refund more of the credit.

Title: Boehner “Compromise” Budget Proposal Is Anything But | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Content:
We issued an analysis this morning of House Minority Leader John Boehner’s proposal to cut funding for discretionary (i.e., annually appropriated) programs other than defense, homeland security, and veterans and to extend all of President Bush’s tax cuts for two years, including those for the wealthiest Americans.
Boehner’s proposal is a rather transparent effort to extend the tax cuts into the next Congress when those who seek to make them permanent will have more votes. It would entail continuing tax cuts that average well over $100,000 a year — double the entire income of the typical American household — for people making over $1 million while cutting basic programs and services that most Americans of ordinary means rely on.
While Rep. Boehner has equated his proposed tax-cut extension with a recent proposal from former OMB director Peter Orszag, the two differ in a critical respect. Orszag called for extending the “middle-class” tax cuts (and, if politically necessary, the high-income tax cuts as well) for two years and then terminating all of them; he envisions a commitment by key policymakers that, in extending the tax cuts now, they will allow them to end after 2012.

In contrast, Rep. Boehner has made clear he still wants all of the tax cuts made permanent.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to John Boehner's stance on taxation and stimulus packages. The information can be summarized as follows:

* Information 1 and 2 are from PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, and mention John Boehner's call to repeal the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people.
* Information 3 is an article from The Washington Post (2021) discussing John Boehner's "Plan B," which would raise taxes on the poor and not extend the stimulus's expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the American Opportunity Credit (AOC).
* Information 4 is an article from The Hill (2016) where John Boehner criticizes President Obama's jobs plan and calls for tax reform, stating that tax increases destroy jobs.
* Information 5 is an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (2010) of John Boehner's budget proposal, which aims to cut funding for discretionary programs and extend President Bush's tax cuts for two years, including those for the wealthiest Americans.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is evidence to support the CLAIM that John Boehner has called for "repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people." This is mentioned in Information 1, 2, and 5, which all suggest that Boehner's proposals would have a negative impact on middle-class people.

Information 3 provides additional context, indicating that Boehner's "Plan B" would disproportionately affect low-income families, which could be seen as a form of raising taxes on middle-class people.

While Information 4 does not directly support the CLAIM, it does show that Boehner has been consistent in his opposition to tax increases, which is relevant to the CLAIM.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **TRUE**. The evidence suggests that John Boehner has indeed called for repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would have a negative impact on middle-class people, including raising their taxes.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to Steve Southerland, a former U.S. Representative from Florida.

Information 1 is a PolitiFact article discussing a TV ad by Allen Boyd, Southerland's opponent, accusing Southerland of not paying his taxes for five years. The ad claims Southerland didn't pay his taxes until he ran for Congress.

Information 2 is a press release from the Florida Democratic Party, stating that Southerland failed to pay his taxes on time at least 27 times, citing an article from The Hill. It also mentions that Southerland voted to raise taxes on the middle class and complained about his $174,000 salary.

Information 3 appears to be an unrelated article about taxes and celebrities, but it does not provide any relevant information about Steve Southerland.

Information 4 is a PolitiFact page about Steve Southerland, providing basic biographical information and fact-checking claims made about him.

Information 5 is an article discussing tax defenses, including the "I forgot" defense, and is not directly related to Steve Southerland.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is evidence to suggest that the CLAIM "Steve Southerland did not pay his taxes in '05, '06, '07, '08 or '09" made by Allen Boyd is TRUE.

Information 1 and Information 2 both support the CLAIM, with Information 2 providing more specific details about Southerland's tax payment history. While Southerland's spokesman claimed that he prioritized paying his employees and keeping the lights on over paying his taxes, the fact that he purchased a $100,000 to $250,000 boat in 2006, one of the years he paid his taxes late, raises questions about his priorities.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM is classified as TRUE.

Title: United States presidential approval rating - Wikipedia
Content:
In the United States, presidential job approval ratings were first conducted by George Gallup (estimated to be 1937) to gauge public support for the president of the United States during their term. An approval rating is a percentage determined by polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a politician based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure.
Typically, an approval rating is given to a politician based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure. A question might ask: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way that the current president is handling their job as president?".
Examples that self select, such as online questions are of this type; however, the aggregate approval rating is generally accepted by statisticians as a statistically valid indicator of the comparative changes in the popular United States mood regarding a president.
^ Only the results of Gallup polls are included as no other poll results exist for presidents before President Clinton.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information consists of five sources related to presidential approval ratings, specifically focusing on Donald Trump's ratings.

Information 1 (2024-03-06) presents a line graph showing Trump's approval ratings from 2017 to 2021, with a high point of 49% and a low point of 34%. The average approval rating during his presidency was 41%.

Information 2 (2021-01-20) is a tracking page for Trump's approval ratings throughout his presidency.

Information 3 (no publication date) is a general resource on presidential job approval ratings following the first 100 days.

Information 4 (2020-06-03) reports that Trump had the highest disapproval rating of any president at that point in office, with 54% disapproval and 42.6% approval.

Information 5 (2024-07-03) provides a general overview of presidential approval ratings in the United States, explaining how they are conducted and what they represent.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM:**

The CLAIM, made by Ted Cruz on April 21, 2016, states that Donald Trump "has the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president."

Based on the provided information, we can evaluate the CLAIM as follows:

* Information 4 (2020-06-03) reports that Trump had the highest disapproval rating of any president at that point in office, with 54% disapproval. This suggests that Trump's disapproval ratings were indeed high.
* However, the CLAIM is specific to Trump's disapproval ratings during the 2016 presidential campaign, whereas Information 4 refers to a later point in Trump's presidency.
* There is no direct evidence in the provided information to support or refute the CLAIM that Trump had the second-highest disapproval ratings of anyone running for president in 2016.

**Classification:**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **UNVERIFIED**. While the information suggests that Trump's disapproval ratings were high during his presidency, there is not enough evidence to confirm or deny the specific CLAIM made by Ted Cruz in 2016.

The American war in Afghanistan incurred staggering costs — for the United States, Afghans and others — over two decades. The U.S. government spent $2.3 trillion, and the war led to the deaths of 2,324 U.S. military personnel, 3,917 U.S. contractors and 1,144 allied troops. For Afghans, the statistics are nearly unimaginable: 70,000 Afghan military and police deaths, 46,319 Afghan civilians (although that is likely a significant underestimation) and some 53,000 opposition fighters killed.

(Adam Ferguson/The New York Times) The full extent of the indirect costs is greater still, considering injuries and illnesses, displacement, war widows and orphans, malnutrition, destruction of infrastructure and environmental degradation due to the war. Given these immense costs and the Taliban’s total victory, it is worth examining closely whether it was possible to achieve a compromise with the Taliban that would have preserved U.S. and Afghan government political objectives.
Potential areas of cooperation between the Taliban and the international community, such as private sector development and alternative livelihoods to now-banned opium poppy cultivation, will be on the agenda at a meeting of international envoys for Afghanistan hosted by the United Nations in Doha from June 30 to July 1. Discussions on women’s rights are not included, as the Taliban consider it an internal matter. This is ironic, given that the private sector is one area where the Taliban allow limited women’s participation. ...

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources that discuss the war in Afghanistan, its costs, and casualties. Here's a brief summary of each source:

1. The United States Institute of Peace article discusses the immense costs of the war in Afghanistan, including the deaths of 2,324 U.S. military personnel, 3,917 U.S. contractors, and 1,144 allied troops. It also mentions the significant human toll on Afghans, with 70,000 military and police deaths, 46,319 civilian deaths, and 53,000 opposition fighters killed.
2. The Wikipedia article lists various incidents of U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan, including the deaths of 2,000 U.S. soldiers by September 2012.
3. The Costs of War article estimates that over 70,000 Afghan and Pakistani civilians have died as a direct result of the war. It also mentions the significant increase in civilian casualties due to the U.S. military's relaxation of its rules of engagement for airstrikes in 2017.
4. The Costs of War article also provides information on the total number of U.S. troops who have died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which had passed 7,000 by the end of 2019. It also mentions the deaths of over 8,000 contractors working for the U.S. in the two war zones.
5. The Statista article provides data on the number of soldiers killed in action in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021. It also mentions the number of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and the resulting deaths.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states that more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months, which is more than the combined total of the nine years before. Based on the provided information, we can analyze the CLAIM as follows:

* Information 2 from Wikipedia lists various incidents of U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan, but it does not provide a specific count of deaths within a 27-month period.
* Information 4 from Costs of War mentions that the number of U.S. troops who have died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan had passed 7,000 by the end of 2019. However, it does not provide a breakdown of deaths within a specific 27-month period.
* Information 5 from Statista provides data on the number of soldiers killed in action in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, but it does not provide a specific count of deaths within a 27-month period.

Based on the available information, it is difficult to verify the CLAIM without more specific data on U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan within the specified 27-month period. Therefore, I would classify the CLAIM as UNVERIFIED due to lack of sufficient evidence.

Those found guilty of knowingly voting twice could face up to 10 years in prison and to pay up to a $100,000 fine. ERIC flagged cases that span across several Georgia counties, including Barrow, Chatham, Cobb, Douglas, Fannin, Forsyth, Fulton, Morgan and Tift. The names of the suspects were not immediately released. Participation in ERIC is becoming rarer in red-leaning states. Until recently, ERIC operated as a silent and trusted elections partner for a bipartisan group of states.
The Secretary of State’s Office this month announced that it was referring 17 cases of possible double voting to local district attorneys. These individuals are suspected of voting once in Georgia and casting a second ballot in another state. The district attorneys will evaluate each case and potentially pursue indictments of the suspects. Those found guilty of knowingly voting twice could face up to 10 years in prison and to pay up to a $100,000 fine.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is asking for investigations into more than a dozen cases of possible voter fraud related to the 2022 General Election.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information consists of five sources related to election fraud and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. The Georgia Secretary of State's Office has a team of investigators to detect fraudulent voting and has referred cases for prosecution. Georgia has seen record voter turnout and has implemented a secure paper ballot voting system.
2. The Elections Division of the Georgia Secretary of State's Office oversees election activity, including voter registration and elections.
3. The Georgia Secretary of State's office is responsible for administering elections and investigating election and voter fraud. They have a Voter Fraud Hotline and a Stop Voter Fraud form to report suspicious activity.
4. The State Election Board cleared an investigation into alleged fraud in Fulton County, finding no evidence of conspiracy or fraud. The investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies and found that allegations against election workers were false and unsubstantiated.
5. The Georgia Secretary of State's Office is investigating 17 cases of possible voter fraud, including individuals suspected of voting twice in different states. These cases were discovered through Georgia's membership in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC).

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the provided information, there is no evidence to support the claim that the Georgia Secretary of State's Office and the Georgia State Elections Board investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election fraud.

While the information does suggest that the Georgia Secretary of State's Office takes election fraud seriously and has mechanisms in place to detect and investigate fraudulent activity, there is no mention of hundreds of people being penalized for election fraud.

In fact, Information 5 mentions that the Secretary of State's Office is investigating 17 cases of possible voter fraud, which is a relatively small number compared to the claim of hundreds of people being penalized.

Additionally, Information 4 highlights an investigation that found no evidence of fraud or conspiracy, and instead, found that allegations against election workers were false and unsubstantiated.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM appears to be FALSE.

Content:
A guide to who controls the redistricting process in all 50 states. ... Every ten years, states redraw the boundaries of their congressional and state legislative districts after the census. Who does the line drawing varies state by state. The way districts are drawn can have a big impact on both voters and politicians. It can influence who wins elections, how political power is distributed, which communities are represented, and what laws are passed.
Political appointee commissions are composed of individuals who are directly appointed by elected officials, party leadership, or political party committees. In some states, the membership of a political appointee commission is evenly divided between parties, while others allow members of one party to hold more seats on the commission than the other. Ohio uses a hybrid between a political appointee commission and a politician commission to draw its state legislative districts.
One state, Arkansas, uses a politician commission for state legislative districts. Politician commissions are comprised entirely of incumbent lawmakers or other elected officials, usually appointed by the legislative or party leadership, the governor, or chief justice of the state supreme court.
Independent commissions are made up of members who are neither public officials nor current lawmakers and are selected with the help of a screening process that is conducted by an independent entity. Commissioners are responsible for drawing and approving the final maps. ... Four states use a political appointee commission for congressional plans, and nine states use this type of commission for state legislative plans.

Title: Who Draws the Maps? | Brennan Center for Justice
Content:
A guide to who controls the redistricting process in all 50 states. ... Every 10 years, states redraw the boundaries of their congressional and state legislative districts after the census. Who does the line drawing varies by state. The way districts are drawn can have a big impact on not just incumbent politicians, but on the communities they represent. It can influence who wins elections, how political power is distributed, which communities are represented, and what laws are passed.
No additional states have adopted political appointee commissions or politician commissions since the 2010 redistricting cycle, though Ohio expanded the politician commission it uses to draw legislative maps to include lawmakers in addition to statewide officials. The fairness of maps will depend not only on the type of entity drawing the map but on whether one party is able to assert sole control over the process. Although, in general, commissions and other non-legislative map drawing processes require bipartisanship, that is not always the case. The tables below look at political control of the process in the 2021–22 cycle of redistricting.
Advisory commissions have become an increasingly popular reform in states without citizen-initiated ballot initiatives where reforms of the redistricting process must go through legislatures. Independent commissions are made up of members who are neither public officials nor current lawmakers and are selected with the help of a screening process conducted by an independent entity.
In general, political appointee commissions have far fewer conflict of interest rules than independent commissions, and members are often picked precisely because of their close ties to the political process or connections with elected officials. Politician commissions are even more tied to the political process, consisting of actual legislators and/or statewide officials.

This is also the first redistricting cycle without a protection under the Voting Rights Act known as “preclearance.” For decades, that required states with a history of voting discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws or drawing new districts.
And redistricting contributes to political polarization by making elections less competitive.

In most states, elected representatives in the state legislature are responsible for drawing the lines—including the districts for their own re-election.

Now you can try your hand at redistricting!
Districtr is a project of the MGGG Redistricting Lab, intended to promote public participation in redistricting around the United States. Redistricting is dividing up a jurisdiction (like a state, county, or city) into pieces that elect representatives. Where and how the lines are drawn influences everything from who has a shot at getting elected to how resources get allocated.
Where and how the lines are drawn influences everything from who has a shot at getting elected to how resources get allocated. Since the founding of the U.S. as a representative democracy, we’ve had the ideal that districts should be a way to communicate very local interests to our wider governing bodies. This only works if districts are built around communities of shared interest. In the U.S., there’s a big redistricting cycle every 10 years after new Census data is released.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information discusses the process of redistricting in the United States, specifically who is responsible for drawing the maps for congressional and state legislative districts. The information is based on guides and articles from reputable sources, including the Brennan Center for Justice, All About Redistricting, and The New York Times.

The key points from the information are:

1. Redistricting is the process of redrawing the boundaries of congressional and state legislative districts every 10 years after the census.
2. The entity responsible for drawing the maps varies by state, with some states using independent commissions, political appointee commissions, politician commissions, or backup commissions.
3. In most states, the state legislature has primary control over the redistricting process, both for state legislative districts and congressional districts.
4. The type of entity drawing the map can influence the fairness of the maps and the distribution of political power.
5. Some states have adopted reforms, such as advisory commissions, to improve the redistricting process.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "Elected officials draw (legislative redistricting) maps. That's it." by Adam Jarchow (July 16, 2019) is partially TRUE.

While it is true that elected officials are often involved in the redistricting process, the information suggests that the process is more complex and varied across states. In some states, independent commissions or political appointee commissions are responsible for drawing the maps, rather than solely elected officials.

Additionally, the information highlights that the type of entity drawing the map can influence the fairness of the maps and the distribution of political power, which suggests that the CLAIM oversimplifies the process.

Therefore, while elected officials do play a role in drawing legislative redistricting maps, the CLAIM is not entirely accurate and should be classified as PARTIALLY TRUE.

Title: MKE County: Parks Budget Surplus Could Fund Infrastructure Projects » Urban Milwaukee
Content:
Specifically, the funds would go to 10 projects that have budget shortfalls or fell outside of the department’s annual maintenance budget. Typically, when a department finishes the year with a budget surplus, the funds go back toward the county’s bottom line and are rolled into an account used to pay down the county’s debt. So Parks will go to the Milwaukee County Board in December seeking authorization to keep the surplus funding within the Parks system.
Closures due to the pandemic and maintenance have diminished attendance at The Domes in recent years, and it has been a while since the facility even met its revenue target. The 2024 county budget will make significant investments in new staff for Parks and infrastructure thanks to the additional 0.4% sales tax approved by the county board in July. Some of the infrastructure projects that would be funded with the $1 million include relatively small items, like exercise equipment for senior centers or bleacher replacement at the Milwaukee County Sports Complex.
Milwaukee County Parks has had such a successful year with its money-making services, like golf, that it plans to invest approximately $1 million in surplus revenue into infrastructure projects around the system.

In simpler terms: We're asking Milwaukee County Parks to do more with less, and the stresses are showing.
But it's never been above $45 million – and this means less money can be spent on park improvements, staff retention, and land management. Factoring in for inflation the budget has been deflating rapidly over the last 30 years · "Generally, if we want to provide large increases to one department, we’re going to have to identify other areas to make decreases," said Joe Lamers, Milwaukee County budget director.

Title: Milwaukee County budget takeaways: A modest increase for parks, cuts to transit and a big push on mental health and youth services
Content:
Milwaukee has long struggled with how to maintain services for incarcerated youth under the care of the county and the state, with the pressure mounting as the state looks to permanently close the doors of Wisconsin's troubled youth prison in the coming years. One significant challenge for the county has been the average daily population at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facilities, Lincoln Hills School and Copper Lake School, and state-run secure mental health treatment facility, Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center.
"This is nowhere near to the level of funding our parks department should have, because of the amount of cuts we have seen throughout the last decade and a half, two decades," he said. Since 2020, the transit department's budget has been heavily reliant on federal funds, with $25 million included in this year's budget proposal.
More:Milwaukee and the state have long been at odds. Quiet meetings this week may mark 'a reset.' Milwaukee County Parks has struggled to maintain levels of its full-time workforce since the 1980s due to high turnover, service level reductions and an increased reliance on seasonal employees to help maintain parks and recreational programs.
The county has also called for additional project funding for the estimated $127 million needed to finish construction of the Center for Forensic Science and Protective Medicine that will house the now-crumbling Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office and the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management. Late last week, Gov. Tony Evers announced a $20 million injection of state funds into the project. There has also been a $20 million increase in state funding for the Children’s Long Term Support program, which provides increased services to children with developmental, mental health or physical challenges.​ The county estimates that roughly 12,000 to 14,000 children in Milwaukee are potentially eligible​ for these services, which would include respite, counseling and therapy, personal support, as well as home modification.​

I was interested to see that the parks have other organizations involved in their activities. The FAA is one; others have broader involvement: the Milwaukee Parks Foundation is presumably comparable to what the library foundation does.
This is among the other priorities for the park system (one of which is “maintaining the availability of public spaces to support the mental and physical health of Milwaukee County citizens”; “mental health” is just showing up in all kinds of areas in the budget, like Pee Wee Herman’s (RIP) secret word). I’ll give a thumbs up to all the great metrics here.

New York’s per capita Medicaid costs have remained the highest among the 50 states even as nationwide spending on the program surged during the pandemic. New York’s version of the safety-net health plan spent a total of $83.4 billion in the federal fiscal year ending in September 2022, according to a recently released financial report by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That equated to $4,240 per resident, which was more than any other state and 70 percent above the U.S. average.
Yet between 2019 and 2022, its total spending surged by 37 percent, which was six points faster than average.

Title: How New York's Bloated Medicaid Program Punishes New Jersey And Other States
Content:
According to the intent of the federal-state Medicaid financial structure, New York and New Jersey should therefore be net payers into the Medicaid program—paying more in federal taxes to finance the federal share of program expenditures throughout the country than they receive in federal reimbursement for state spending. However, New York’s Medicaid industrial complex has resulted in the state receiving billions more in federal Medicaid money than its residents pay in federal taxes to finance the federal share. The table below contrasts New Jersey and New York Medicaid spending data in fiscal year (FY) 2013—the year before the ACA expansion took effect—and FY 2015—the second year of the ACA expansion.
Although the ratio of New York’s Medicaid spending to New Jersey’s Medicaid spending may have declined because of the ACA, the central point is that the ACA has resulted in a spending explosion in states adopting the expansion. Therefore, despite New Jersey’s own surge of federal Medicaid money from the expansion, New Jersey’s net income loss is even higher in 2015 than it was in 2013!
Because Medicaid spreads the burden of state spending decisions in this way, many states grow inefficiently large programs and create numerous accounting gimmicks to access as much federal money as possible. After all, every extra dollar that they spend is largely coming out of the pockets of people outside their jurisdiction. Despite being one of the nation’s wealthiest states, New York receives about $6 billion a year more in federal Medicaid spending than its residents pay in federal taxes to finance other states’ Medicaid spending. In contrast, New Jersey receives about $6 billion a year less in federal Medicaid spending than its residents pay in federal taxes to finance other states’ Medicaid spending.
Despite New York and New Jersey adopting the ACA expansion, the states were both worse off because their residents, who are wealthier on average, had to finance other states’ expensive expansions. In 2013, New York received five times as much money in federal Medicaid spending as New Jersey although its population was only about twice as large. Because New Jersey added a relatively larger number of people to Medicaid through the ACA expansion than New York (New York had already expanded Medicaid to many people made eligible by the ACA), New York received only about four times as much federal Medicaid money as New Jersey in 2015.

Title: A Report Card on State Spending | City Journal
Content:
New Yorkers pay more of their income in taxes than virtually anyone else, yet the state is facing a serious fiscal crisis. Why? The simple answer is because New York also leads the answer nation in spending. In 1989, for example, Albany spent $2,554 for every man, woman, and child in the state, making it […]
At $21,075, New York’s average income is quite high, ranking fourth in the nation, behind Connecticut, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Even so, it is only 29 percent higher than the nationwide average and 12 percent higher than the average of the other large states. New York’s per capita spending is 26 percent of its per capita income; for the other 47 states, the figure is 21 percent. Thus, even though they make more money, New Yorkers see substantially more of their income go to state and local government than do residents of other states.
What else, then, accounts for New York’s extraordinarily high spending? Aid to the poor is responsible for a large portion. Table 4 shows expenditures in four categories of low-income assistance: welfare (including Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC], and other means-tested benefits), housing (including community development), public hospitals (most of whose clients are poor), and other health programs.

Information 2 reports that New York's per capita Medicaid costs remain the highest among the 50 states, with a total spending of $83.4 billion in the federal fiscal year ending in September 2022.

Information 3 reveals that New York City receives 58.4% of Medicaid state spending, while Western New York receives 4.5%.

Information 4 compares Medicaid spending between New York and New Jersey, showing that despite New Jersey's surge in federal Medicaid money, New Jersey's net income loss is higher due to New York's large Medicaid program.

Information 5 discusses New York State's high spending, including on Medicaid, and how it affects the state's fiscal crisis.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM made by Chris Christie in 2011, "Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey," appears to be TRUE.

Information 1 and 2 confirm that New York spends more on Medicaid benefits than most other states, including New Jersey. Information 4 specifically compares Medicaid spending between New York and New Jersey, showing that New York receives significantly more federal Medicaid money than New Jersey.

While the CLAIM only compares New York to New Jersey, the provided information suggests that New York's Medicaid spending is among the highest in the country, supporting the CLAIM's assertion.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM is classified as TRUE.

These measures include actions such as ending lawsuits in which one defendant can be responsible for paying all of the damages if other defendants lack the resources to pay (joint and several liability); reducing damage awards by the amount available to an injured party from collateral sources (such as workers compensation and health insurance); limiting contingency fees that a lawyer can claim to cover fees and expenses; limiting the length of time after an injury that a lawsuit may be brought to trial, permitting the award of future damages such as lost wages and health care costs to be paid in installments instead of one lump sum; and limiting damages awarded in malpractice lawsuits.
Others have proposed eliminating physician liability entirely and replacing it with enterprise liability in which the health care organization where the care is delivered is held responsible for negligence [15]. The goal of enterprise liability is to monitor quality of care while reducing costs, and expedite the resolution of malpractice. Some health organizations who employ physicians already apply some of these concepts by assuming legal responsibility for their employee-physicians. Different states have different regulations for the actual filing of a lawsuit related to medical negligence; some of these regulations are the result of incremental tort reform efforts. Thus, state regulations may limit the choice of venue, i.e., limit the court in which a plaintiff can file the lawsuit instead of shopping for an alternative venue with a history of generous awards for plaintiffs.

This would lead to lower spending on federal health care programs. The likely overall result, the CBO says, would be to reduce deficits by nearly $50 billion over 10 years. Supporters of the bill say caps on medical malpractice awards discourage frivolous lawsuits and reduce the cost of health care because providers no longer need to practice defensive medicine.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

Information 1 describes a bill passed in the Missouri House of Representatives that would limit medical malpractice lawsuits by only allowing patients to sue hospitals if the physician accused of wrongdoing is an employee. Hospitals could not be sued for malpractice by doctors with admitting privileges.

Information 2 discusses a bill passed in the US House of Representatives that caps medical malpractice lawsuits by limiting plaintiff damages to $250,000. The bill also limits attorney fees and has a three-year statute of limitations.

Information 3 provides an overview of medical malpractice in the United States, including various measures to reform the system, such as limiting damages, contingency fees, and the length of time to bring a lawsuit to trial.

Information 4 reports on California Governor Gavin Newsom signing legislation to modernize the state's medical malpractice system, which includes restructuring attorney fees and raising the cap on noneconomic damages.

Information 5 discusses a GOP health bill that proposes new limits to medical malpractice awards, citing the potential to reduce deficits by nearly $50 billion over 10 years. However, research suggests that medical liability costs make up only 2 to 2.5 percent of total healthcare spending.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM> made by Mitch McConnell on December 1, 2009, stating that the Senate healthcare bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.

Based on the provided INFORMATION, it appears that the <CLAIM> is FALSE. Information 2 and 5 suggest that there have been efforts to limit medical malpractice lawsuits, including capping damages and attorney fees, which contradicts McConnell's claim. Additionally, Information 1 and 4 show that states like Missouri and California have implemented or proposed reforms to their medical malpractice systems, further supporting the idea that limits on medical malpractice lawsuits have been considered or implemented.

It's worth noting that the <CLAIM> is from 2009, and the INFORMATION provided is from various dates, including 2017, 2023, and 2024. Therefore, it's possible that the Senate healthcare bill in 2009 did not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits, but subsequent efforts have been made to reform the system. However, based on the available INFORMATION, it appears that the <CLAIM> is FALSE.

Information 3 (2024) describes the 111th United States Congress, which spanned from 2009 to 2011, during Obama's first term. It notes that the Democratic Party increased its majorities in both chambers, briefly achieving a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate.

Information 4 (no publication date) discusses the electoral losses suffered by Democratic elected officials during the Obama Administration, including the loss of state legislatures and Congressional seats.

Information 5 (no publication date) provides information on House and Senate concurrence with presidents, including a note on Senator Jim Jeffords' switch from Republican to independent in 2001, which briefly gave Democrats a majority in the Senate.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Haley Barbour on October 2, 2011, states that when President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he "had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson."

Based on the provided information, this CLAIM can be classified as **TRUE**.

Information 3 (2024) confirms that in the 111th United States Congress, the Democratic Party increased its majorities in both chambers, with a brief filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate. This suggests that Obama did indeed have significant Democratic majorities in Congress when he took office in 2009.

Additionally, Information 1 (2016) and Information 4 (no publication date) provide context on the Democratic Party's strong position in Congress at the beginning of Obama's presidency, which supports the CLAIM.

While the CLAIM may be an exaggeration, as it is unclear whether Obama's majorities were the largest since Lyndon Johnson, the available information suggests that Obama did have significant Democratic majorities in Congress when he took office, making the CLAIM generally accurate.

We do need states actively involved in this process.
The man who runs it, Michael Becar, says most police departments never even check it when they hire new officers. MICHAEL BECAR: One of the issues is that they just don't know about it. You know, we're running this thing on a shoestring budget since the federal government doesn't provide any money.

In Minneapolis, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo quickly fired the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. But very few chiefs have this ability. In my time as a chief in Michigan, Colorado and Florida, I never did, thanks to a combination of state and local laws, union contracts, and past labor precedents.
The chief suspends him immediately. Often, the cop still gets paid to sit at home, because this is legally required. Internal affairs investigates, but the process is delayed by exasperating legal and contract hurdles. Meanwhile, the community stews: Why hasn’t the chief fired him?
Finally, the chief has the evidence to act. If merited, the cop is fired. Months have gone by, but that was the easy part. Now the cop will appeal — because the review process is staggeringly favorable to bad cops.
The arguments are always the same: The chief’s investigation was shoddy; the chief had a vendetta against this particular cop; other cops did this before and weren’t fired; the alleged misconduct wasn’t really that bad. Too often, arbitrators feel the pressure to “split the baby” in their decisions.

There are people who simply won’t apply for a position if they know that part of the process involves releasing the names of all the candidates.

In some cases, current police chiefs know their careers may be negatively impacted if their name is released during a process.

“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” This saying is reflected in proposed health reform plans and the efforts to increase investments in prevention throughout the U.S. healthcare delivery system. With evidence that nearly 40 percent of all deaths in the United States are due to behavioral causes, attention to prevention has encompassed obesity and tobacco smoking prevention in addition to vaccinations and cancer screening (Mokdad et al., 2004).
Cohen JT, Neumann PJ, Weinstein MC. Does preventive care save money? Health economics and the presidential candidates. New England Journal of Medicine. 2008;358(7):661–663. [PubMed: 18272889]
With government budgets and corporate survival imperiled by healthcare costs, the search for “savings” in prevention, which accounts for an estimated 3 percent of spending, not only misses the point but risks overlooking the major cost drivers responsible for spending. The crisis calls for a shift in attitude that places prevention on the same playing field as all of health care and poses the same questions of any service, whether its purpose is prevention, diagnostic testing, or treatment: (1) Does the intervention improve health outcomes, and how strong is the evidence?
By making too little use of the forms of prevention that offer high economic value—greater health benefits per dollar—the opportunity to do more with the same resources, and to save more lives in the process, is also forfeited. This opportunity cost, albeit subtle, may be the more important economic price paid for inadequate emphasis on prevention. The majority of the $2 trillion that society spends annually on health care goes toward interventions of low-economic value (e.g., services costing $50,000 to $1 million per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) gained.

Title: Does Preventive Care Save Money? Health Economics and the Presidential Candidates | NEJM
Content:
Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.3 For example, screening costs will exceed the savings from avoided treatment in cases in which only a very small fraction of the population would have become ill in the absence of preventive measures. Preventive measures that do not save money may or may not represent cost-effective care (i.e., good value for the resources expended).
Preventive measures that do not save money may or may not represent cost-effective care (i.e., good value for the resources expended). Whether any preventive measure saves money or is a reasonable investment despite adding to costs depends entirely on the particular intervention and the specific population in question.
Although some preventive measures do save money, the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not. Careful analysis of the costs and benefits of specific interventions, rather than broad generalizations, is critical. Such analysis could identify not only cost-saving preventive measures but also preventive measures that deliver substantial health benefits relative to their net costs; this analysis could also identify treatments that are cost-saving or highly efficient (i.e., cost-effective).

Title: Preventive Care Saves Money? Sorry, It’s Too Good to Be True - The New York Times
Content:
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it tends to cost money, but it improves quality of life at a very reasonable price. ... By Aaron E. Carroll · Jan. 29, 2018 ... The idea that spending more on preventive care will reduce overall health care spending is widely believed and often promoted as a reason to support reform.
Wellness programs, based on the idea that we can save money on health care by giving people incentives to be healthy, don’t actually work this way. As my colleague Austin Frakt and I have found from reviewing the research in detail, these programs don’t decrease costs — at least not without being discriminatory. Accountable care organizations rely on the premise that improving outpatient and preventive care, perhaps with improved management and coordination of services for those with chronic conditions, will save money.
The idea that spending more on preventive care will reduce overall health care spending is widely believed and often promoted as a reason to support reform. It’s thought that too many people with chronic illnesses wait until they are truly ill before seeking care, often in emergency rooms, where it costs more. It should follow then that treating diseases earlier, or screening for them before they become more serious, would wind up saving money in the long run.
Accountable care organizations rely on the premise that improving outpatient and preventive care, perhaps with improved management and coordination of services for those with chronic conditions, will save money. But a recent study in Health Affairs showed that care coordination and management initiatives in the outpatient setting haven’t been drivers of savings in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. There’s little reason to believe that even more preventive care in general is going to save a fortune.

Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, are responsible for 7 of 10 deaths among Americans each year and account for 75 % of the nation’s health spending – and often are preventable. The Affordable Care Act – the health insurance reform legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama on March 23 – will help make prevention affordable and accessible by requiring health plans to cover recommended preventive services without charging a deductible, copayment or co-insurance.[1]
Prevention and Public Health Council: The Affordable Care Act creates a National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council, composed of senior government officials, to coordinate Federal prevention activities and design a National Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy with input from stakeholders and communities across the country to promote the nation’s health.
Obese individuals have health care costs 39 % above average. Providing obesity reduction services and reducing disease related to obesity could lower premiums overall by 0.05 to 0.1 %. Other studies have found cost savings associated with other preventive services: for example, every dollar spent on immunizations could save $5.30 on direct health care costs and $16.50 on total societal costs of disease.[10] A review of preventive services by the National Commission on Prevention Priorities found that, in addition to childhood immunizations, two of the recommended preventive services – discussing aspirin use with high-risk adults and tobacco use screening and brief intervention – are cost-saving in populations under 65.

Prevention and Public Health Fund: The Affordable Care Act makes an unprecedented investment – $15 billion over 10 years – in health care programs and providers to prevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION and an evaluation of the <CLAIM>:

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided INFORMATION suggests that the relationship between preventive care and cost savings is complex and nuanced. While some preventive measures may save money, others may not, and the overall impact on healthcare costs is unclear.

Information 1 highlights the importance of prevention in the US healthcare system, citing that nearly 40% of deaths in the US are due to behavioral causes. It also notes that the majority of healthcare spending goes towards interventions of low economic value.

Information 2 emphasizes that preventive care may not always save money, and its cost-effectiveness depends on the specific intervention and population in question.

Information 3 argues that the idea that preventive care saves money is a myth, citing that wellness programs and accountable care organizations have not been shown to decrease costs.

Information 4 suggests that while prevention may not save money, it is still important for improving quality of life and saving lives.

Information 5 provides context on the Affordable Care Act's focus on preventive care, highlighting the potential cost savings associated with certain preventive services, such as immunizations and tobacco use screening.

**Evaluation of the <CLAIM>:**

Based on the provided INFORMATION, the <CLAIM> "Preventive care does not save the government money" made by David Brooks in 2009 can be classified as **PARTIALLY TRUE**.

While some studies suggest that preventive care may not always save money, others indicate that certain preventive services can be cost-effective or even cost-saving. The evidence suggests that the relationship between preventive care and cost savings is more nuanced than a simple yes or no answer.

The <CLAIM> oversimplifies the complex issue of preventive care and cost savings, and a more accurate statement would be that the impact of preventive care on healthcare costs varies depending on the specific intervention, population, and context.

President Bush enacted policies to help Americans receive the care they need at a price they can afford and also infused transparency and innovation into the health care system. The President instituted the most significant reforms to Medicare in nearly 40 years, most notably through a prescription drug benefit, which has provided more than 40 million Americans with better access to prescription drugs.
The President also created tax-free Health Savings Accounts to help Americans take charge of their health care decision-making, and increased funding for medical research, which contributed to medical breakthroughs such as the development of the HPV cancer vaccine.
Empowered Americans to take charge of their health care decision-making by establishing tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). This enabled more than six million Americans who have enrolled in HSA-eligible plans to save money tax-free for current and future medical expenses.
Infused transparency about price and quality into the health care system and launched an initiative to make electronic health records available to most Americans within 10 years. The President also directed Federal agencies to inform beneficiaries of the prices paid to doctors and hospitals and empowered Americans to find better value and better care, largely through increased competition, and he ordered Federal agencies to use improved health IT systems to facilitate the rapid exchange of electronic health information to improve the quality of care for Americans.

Title: The 2008 Presidential Candidates' Health Reform Proposals: Choices for America | Commonwealth Fund
Content:
This analysis examines key differences and areas of agreement in the health system reform proposals of presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama. The report describes how each candidate would seek to expand health insurance coverage, improve the quality and efficiency of the health system, and control costs
Universal coverage is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for improving the performance of the health system. Moreover, how policymakers design health insurance reforms will affect whether everyone can have affordable insurance that covers essential services and whether sustained improvements in quality and efficiency are achievable. As presidential candidates, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama propose reforms that would place the nation's health system on very different paths, with profound implications for the American people.
Measured against these broad principles, Obama's proposal for mixed private–public group insurance with a shared responsibility for financing has greater potential to move the health care system toward high performance than does McCain's proposal to encourage individual market coverage through the use of tax incentives and deregulation (Figure ES-4). Compared with McCain's approach, Obama's approach could provide more people with affordable health insurance that covers essential services, achieve greater equity in access to care, realize efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of coverage and delivery of care, and redirect incentives to improve quality. In the absence of a requirement that everyone has affordable coverage, however, the proposal is likely to fall short of achieving universal coverage.
Both presidential candidates, Senator John McCain (R–Ariz.) and Senator Barack Obama (D–Ill.), have proposed plans to reform the health insurance system in the United States. They also have put forth ideas to improve the quality and efficiency of care. To inform the public discussion about possible paths to reform, this report describes the candidates' proposals, examines key differences in their vision of a future health insurance system, and evaluates the proposals against key principles outlined by the Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources discussing healthcare policies and proposals by President George Bush, Senator John McCain, and Senator Barack Obama.

Information 1 highlights President Bush's healthcare policies, including the introduction of a prescription drug benefit, tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and increased funding for medical research.

Information 2, a campaign speech by Barack Obama, criticizes George Bush's healthcare policies, stating that premiums have risen four times faster than wages, and seven million more Americans are uninsured. Obama argues that John McCain's plan is similar to Bush's and only benefits the healthy and wealthy.

Information 3 discusses John McCain's 2008 healthcare plan, which aimed to transform the healthcare market by providing tax credits to individuals, allowing them to purchase health insurance. The plan also included enhanced HSAs, enabling individuals to save money tax-free for medical expenses.

Information 4 presents Barack Obama's criticism of John McCain's healthcare plan, labeling it "radical" and arguing that it would raise taxes. Obama advocates for a universal healthcare plan, financed by eliminating the Bush tax cuts.

Information 5 analyzes the healthcare reform proposals of John McCain and Barack Obama, highlighting their differences in expanding health insurance coverage, improving the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system, and controlling costs.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "John McCain and George Bush have absolutely no plan for universal health care" can be classified as **FALSE**.

While it is true that George Bush's policies did not aim to provide universal healthcare, his administration did introduce measures to improve healthcare access, such as the prescription drug benefit and HSAs (Information 1).

John McCain's 2008 healthcare plan, although not a traditional universal healthcare plan, did propose tax credits to individuals to purchase health insurance, which could be seen as a step towards increasing healthcare access (Information 3). Additionally, Information 5 suggests that McCain's plan aimed to encourage individual market coverage through tax incentives and deregulation, which, although different from Obama's universal healthcare approach, still constitutes a plan to expand healthcare coverage.

Therefore, the CLAIM is an exaggeration, as both Bush and McCain had some plans or proposals related to healthcare access, even if they were not comprehensive universal healthcare plans.

"Buckyball advocates and even one CSPC commissioner have argued that the CPSC's actions against Buckyballs were unfair and unprecedented, and that the commission's settlement with Zucker out of court was something of an admission that perhaps they'd gone further than reasonable in trying to prevent harm to children.

Content:
In 2012, following reports of consumers (mostly children) ingesting small, high-powered magnets made of rare earth materials such as neodymium, the commission voted to block sales of Maxfield & Oberton’s Buckyballs-branded toys, and later voted to issue a rule that would amount to a ban on all similar toys.
Thus, the president is generally expected to consult with members of the opposite party in the Senate to select members of the commission from the opposite party. The commissioners (including the chairman) vote on selecting the vice chairman, who becomes acting chairman if the chairman’s term ends upon resignation or expiration.
In March 2020, President Trump nominated Nancy Beck, an official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who previously worked for an association representing the U.S. chemical industry, to chair the commission, but it was not acted on by the Senate. As of March 25, 2024, the commission had a Democratic majority, 3-to-2. The CPSC regulates the manufacture and sale of more than 15,000 different consumer products, from cribs to all-terrain vehicles.
The agency was created in 1972 through the Consumer Product Safety Act. The agency reports to Congress and the President; it is not part of any other department or agency in the federal government. The CPSC has five commissioners, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for staggered seven-year terms.
The aspect of CPSC’s work that most U.S. citizens might recognize is the “recall,” formally a “corrective action” in which a company develops a “a comprehensive plan that reaches throughout the entire distribution chain to consumers who have the product” and addresses a potential or alleged failure of a product.

Title: PolitiFact | Phil Roe
Content:
Signs letter saying Consumer Product Safety Commission is acting "without consultation or input from the company" to stop the sale of Buckyballs.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information revolves around the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and its actions regarding Buckyballs, a product consisting of small, powerful neodymium magnets. 

Information 1 and 5 indicate that Phil Roe, a U.S. Representative, signed a letter on October 1, 2012, stating that the CPSC was acting "without consultation or input from the company" to stop the sale of Buckyballs.

Information 2 provides background on Buckyballs, mentioning that the CPSC took notice of the product after hundreds of thousands of units were sold, and children mistook the magnets for candy, leading to hospitalizations. The CPSC and Buckyballs reached an agreement to change the product's labels, but later forced a recall and held the co-founder, Craig Zucker, personally responsible for the recall costs.

Information 3 appears to be unrelated to Buckyballs, but rather discusses a separate issue involving Medicare patients' healthcare decisions.

Information 4 provides general information about the CPSC, its structure, and its role in regulating consumer products. It also mentions the CPSC's actions in 2012 to block the sales of Buckyballs-branded toys and issue a rule to ban similar toys.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM made by Phil Roe on October 1, 2012, appears to be TRUE. The evidence from Information 1, 2, and 5 supports the CLAIM, indicating that the CPSC did take action to stop the sale of Buckyballs without consulting the company. Information 2 specifically mentions that the CPSC forced a recall of Buckyballs in late 2012, which aligns with the timeline of Phil Roe's letter.

While Information 4 provides general context about the CPSC, it does not contradict the CLAIM. Information 3 is unrelated to the CLAIM and does not provide any evidence to support or refute it.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM made by Phil Roe is classified as TRUE.

To see whether voters believe that Obama was not born in the United States, we asked them about their agreement with this statement: “Barack Obama was born in the United States.” The chart below shows responses broken down by party identification.
To see whether voters believe that Obama was not born in the United States, we asked them about their agreement with this statement: “Barack Obama was born in the United States.” The chart below shows responses broken down by party identification. A first look reveals significant and surprising differences between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to their beliefs about Obama’s birthplace. While more than eight in 10 Democrats agreed with the claim, far more Republicans disagreed with the statement (41 percent) than agreed with it (27 percent).
An additional 31 percent of Republicans expressed some doubts about whether Obama is a native U.S. citizen (i.e. indicating that they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement). Only slightly more than one in four Republican voters agreed that the president was born in the United States.
In fact, the distributions are statistically indistinguishable: 40 percent of knowledgeable Republicans disagree that Obama was born in the U.S. compared to 42 percent of lower knowledge Republicans. A greater factual understanding of the political system does not diminish Republicans’ doubts about Obama’s birthplace.

Title: Poll: 54% of Republicans say that, "deep down," Obama is a Muslim - Vox
Content:
Vox is a general interest news site for the 21st century. Its mission: to help everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help shape it. In text, video and audio, our reporters explain politics, policy, world affairs, technology, culture, science, the climate crisis, money, health and everything else that matters.
Over half of Republicans answered "Muslim" when asked which religion describes President Obama's "deep down" beliefs, according to a newly released poll by Alex Theodoridis of the University of California at Merced. Theodoridis, who released the results on Wednesday on the Washington Post political science blog Monkey Cage, asked Americans this question: "Which of these do you think most likely describes what Obama believes deep down?
Among Republicans, 54 percent answered "Muslim" when asked what Obama believes; only nine percent said "Christian," his stated religion. Identifying Obama as affiliated with Islam is not unique to Republicans, according to the poll, which found that 10 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Independents answered "Muslim" as well.
But by asking "what Obama believes deep down?" I was intentionally granting respondents license to stray from the president's self-reported Christian faith. This reveals a prevalent willingness to distrust this president or categorize him as "the other" in terms of religion. The uptick in American, and particularly Republican, views of Obama as Muslim may also in part be explained by the rise of ISIS, which political opponents have seized on to argue that Obama is soft on Islamist terror.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION provided consists of five polls conducted between 2010 and 2021, which surveyed Americans' beliefs about President Obama's religion and birthplace. The polls consistently show that a significant percentage of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim, despite his self-identification as a Christian. The percentages of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim range from 43% (Information 1, 2016) to 54% (Information 3, 2016, and Information 5, 2015). Additionally, the polls reveal that many Republicans also doubt Obama's U.S. birthplace, with some polls showing that around 40% of Republicans believe he was not born in the United States.

Based on this INFORMATION, I would classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE. The polls consistently show that a large percentage of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim, with some polls indicating that a majority of Republicans hold this belief. Additionally, the polls also reveal that many Republicans doubt Obama's U.S. birthplace, which supports the second part of the <CLAIM>. While the exact wording of the <CLAIM> uses the phrase "large majority," which might be subjective, the polls provide strong evidence to support the general claim that many Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born.

Title: DREAM Act - Wikipedia
Content:
The bill also restores the option for states to determine residency for purposes of higher education benefits by repealing Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 (8 U.S.C. § 1623. The majority of states interpret this provision as disqualifying undocumented immigrant students from certain higher education benefits such as in-state tuition rates.
Some states have enacted laws aimed at making undocumented state residents eligible for in-state tuition rates without violating this IIRIRA provision. However, some students paying out-of-state tuition have filed lawsuits in these states, claiming state education officials violated this federal law.
In light of the criticism, Durbin tabled the amendment in favor of a rewritten DREAM Act amendment to the Defense Bill. In consideration of their opponents, all language regarding in-state tuition was removed from the amendment and an age cap of 30 was put in place for potential beneficiaries.
The Act would also terminate the deportation proceedings of anyone meeting the requirements of the Dream Act and those enrolled in elementary or secondary school over 5 years of age. It lastly would improve accessibility to college in-state tuition and financial aid for undocumented youth and immigrants.
Education is a major priority for The DREAM Act. In a research article written by Roger M. Mahony, it is stated that the DREAM Act aims to repeal a provision of law that penalizes states for offering these students in-state tuition rates. Depending on eligibility standards, the DREAM Act could benefit as many as 1.2 million young people in the United States, giving them an opportunity to reach their educational and economic potential.

Title: Study: In-state tuition for Md. illegals would generate up to $66M a year - Washington Times
Content:
A Maryland ballot question to allow in-state tuition rates for some illegal immigrants would bring more money into the state rather than increasing the burden on taxpayers, according to a study released Monday. The study by the University of Maryland Baltimore County’s Maryland Institute for Policy Analysis and Research found that the state’s Dream Act — which passed the General Assembly last year but was forced to referendum by voters — would generate as much as $66 million a year for the state and businesses by providing better access to education for illegal immigrants, which would in turn help them to secure high-paying jobs and pay more taxes.
The study by the University of Maryland Baltimore County’s Maryland Institute for Policy Analysis and Research found that the state’s Dream Act — which passed the General Assembly last year but was forced to referendum by voters — would generate as much as $66 million a year for the state and businesses by providing better access to education for illegal immigrants, which would in turn help them to secure high-paying jobs and pay more taxes. “The initial costs of the investment in education will be more than offset by increased tax revenues and lower government spending on incarceration and other government programs that result from a more educated citizenry,” the study said. Opponents of the Dream Act have argued that the law would attract illegal immigrants to the state and lead to a run on college enrollment, which would leave taxpayers footing the bill.
The law would allow college-age illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates if they graduated from a Maryland high school after three years of attendance, and if they or a guardian filed income-tax returns each year during that span. Students would start at a two-year community college before transferring to a four-year institution. The study found that the Dream Act would initially cost the state and its counties a combined $7.2 million a year, but they would eventually earn back $24.6 million in tax benefits and savings.

Title: Dream Act Becomes Law in California - The New York Times
Content:
Jerry Brown signed the second portion of the state’s Dream Act into law. The legislation allows illegal immigrants who graduate from high schools in California to apply to the state’s public universities as residents, granting them a reduced tuition rate.
So millions will be spent on illegals educations by the State after they cried poor last year and took millions upon millions from the cities and counties in California to allegedly balance the budget. Effect: thousands of police, firefighters and teachers were laid off, schools were closed, universities raised tuition again and again, essential services cut or completely dropped and now we’re going to give millions to illegals who shouldn’t be here to begin with.
I can understand the need for education and I can respect the desire for self improvement by both legal and illegal. However are we still going charge out of state tuition to citizens of the U.S .? if so how does that work ? If you are in the US illegally no problem but if you are from another state then you pay more or if you are in the country on student visa then you pay the higher tuition fee.
The very concept is a contradiction in terms: “Let’s make it legal to give illegals free tuition”?! Come on, Governor Moonbeam. This is a reckless use of taxpayers’ money. MY money. I want my taxes to be used for MY kids’ and grandkids’ education. Doling out equal shares of financial aid to illegals is going to do nothing but take opportunities away from our own residents AND exacerbate the already ballooning illegal immigration crisis we have in the US!

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The DREAM Act is a proposed legislation that aims to provide educational benefits to undocumented immigrant students. The Act would repeal a provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 that penalizes states for offering in-state tuition rates to undocumented students. The Act would allow states to determine residency for purposes of higher education benefits, making undocumented students eligible for in-state tuition rates. Additionally, the Act would provide access to federal financial aid and improve accessibility to college education for undocumented youth and immigrants.

The Act has been supported by some states, such as Maryland, which has passed a law allowing in-state tuition rates for certain undocumented immigrants. A study by the University of Maryland Baltimore County found that the law would generate up to $66 million a year for the state and businesses by providing better access to education for illegal immigrants, which would in turn help them secure high-paying jobs and pay more taxes.

However, opponents of the DREAM Act argue that it would attract illegal immigrants to the state and lead to a run on college enrollment, leaving taxpayers footing the bill. Some critics, like the author of Information 4, believe that providing education benefits to undocumented immigrants is a reckless use of taxpayers' money and would take opportunities away from U.S. citizens.

Based on the available information, the <CLAIM> by John Mica, "On the question on the DREAM Act, no -- no to granting lower tuition to illegals," can be classified as TRUE. The claim is consistent with the opposition to the DREAM Act, which argues that providing education benefits to undocumented immigrants is not justified. The claim is also supported by the criticism of the DREAM Act, which suggests that it would be a misuse of taxpayers' money and would take opportunities away from U.S. citizens.

Content:
Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. ... During a May 10, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee event in Austin, Texas, President Barack Obama offered a litany of accomplishments to a friendly audience.
Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country." The claim that immediately caught our eye was that during Obama’s presidency, the United States has "doubled our exports."
The claim that immediately caught our eye was that during Obama’s presidency, the United States has "doubled our exports." So we decided to take a look. We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which produces monthly statistical tables on trade. One table offers data that begins in January 2009 -- when Obama was inaugurated -- and ends in March 2011.
This isn’t the first time Obama has spoken of doubling exports. In his 2011 State of the Union address, he said, "To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up." But Bryan Riley, a senior trade policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that the president hasn’t met the goal yet.

Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Jim McNerney, Chair of the President’s Export Council, said, "President Obama has assembled an outstanding team to help reach the goal he has set for our nation to double U.S. exports over the next five years. It is an ambitious goal. However, with this team in place, I am confident we can develop a solid plan for the public policy decisions that will expand free and fair trade and strengthen the United States economically.
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, President Barack Obama will provide a progress report on the National Export Initiative (NEI), which shows that the President’s goal of doubling exports and supporting several million new jobs over five years is on track, and that exports in the first four months of 2010 grew almost 17 percent from the same period last year.
President Obama said, “Boosting America’s exports strengthens our economic growth and supports millions of good, high-paying American jobs. That’s why I set a goal during my State of the Union address to double our exports over the next five years. Since then, my Administration has worked to improve advocacy for our exporters, remove trade barriers, and enforce trade rules in an effort to ensure that the benefits of global trade are broadly shared.
However, with this team in place, I am confident we can develop a solid plan for the public policy decisions that will expand free and fair trade and strengthen the United States economically.

I look forward to consulting with Congress on these reforms, as well as our broader export control reform effort. So that's how we'll help double our exports, open up new markets, and level the playing field for American workers and businesses. And I have every confidence that we can and will succeed in this endeavor.
Another obstacle our exporters face is that the federal government just hasn't done a good enough job advocating for them abroad. That's why, as the second part of the National Export Initiative, the United States of America will go to bat for our businesses and our workers.
Secretary Clinton is mobilizing a commercial diplomacy strategy, directing every one of our embassies to create a Senior Visitor Business Liaison who will manage our export advocacy efforts locally, and when our ambassadors return stateside, we'll ask them to travel the United States to discuss export opportunities in their countries of assignment.
And we remain the number one exporter of goods and services in the world. But we shouldn't be satisfied with being number one. We shouldn't assume our leadership is guaranteed. When other markets are growing, and other nations are competing, we need to get even better. We need to secure our companies a level playing field. We need to guarantee American workers a fair shake. We need to up our game. That's why, for the first time, the United States of America is launching a single, comprehensive strategy to promote American exports.

America’s trade policy has an enormous impact on the economic well-being of the American people, and the strategic interests of the United States. Trade can support American jobs, eliminate taxes on American exports, help American businesses reach new markets, protect the environment, promote stronger labor standards, combat human trafficking, defend the intellectual property of American innovators, and shape a better future for our children — those are the types of agreements that President Obama has pursued.
For years, President Obama worked with 11 other major economies to secure the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a high-standards trade agreement that ensures that the United States will have the access we need to the largest emerging market in the world. The Asia Pacific region within TPP encompasses nearly 40 percent of the world’s GDP. Shaping the rules of the road for trade in this region is good for our workers and businesses — and it is good for our national security as well.  · There is no question that our security and prosperity will be increasingly tied to the Asia Pacific.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources related to President Barack Obama's claims about doubling US exports during his presidency.

Information 1 from PolitiFact fact-checks Obama's claim that the US has doubled its exports during his presidency. The article cites data from the US Census Bureau, which shows that exports have increased, but not doubled, during Obama's presidency.

Information 2 from the White House website provides a progress report on the National Export Initiative (NEI), which aims to double US exports over five years. The report states that exports grew by 17% in the first four months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.

Information 3 is a press release from the American Presidency Project, where Obama discusses the National Export Initiative and his goal to double US exports. He outlines strategies to achieve this goal, including improving advocacy for US exporters and leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses.

Information 4 from FactCheck.org examines Obama's claim that he is responsible for the US becoming the world's biggest oil producer. The article concludes that while oil production did increase during Obama's presidency, it was largely due to technological advances rather than his actions.

Information 5 from the White House website discusses the importance of trade policy for US national security and the economy. It highlights the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which aims to promote US exports and economic growth.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, it appears that Obama's claim that the US has "doubled our exports" during his presidency is partially true but exaggerated. While exports did increase during his presidency, the data from the US Census Bureau (Information 1) suggests that they did not quite double.

The National Export Initiative (Information 2) aimed to double US exports over five years, and the progress report shows that exports grew by 17% in the first four months of 2010. However, this growth rate is not sustained over the entire presidency.

Obama's strategies outlined in Information 3, such as improving advocacy for US exporters and leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses, may have contributed to the growth in exports. However, the evidence suggests that the goal of doubling exports was not fully achieved.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **PARTIALLY TRUE**. While Obama's presidency did see an increase in US exports, the claim that they doubled is an exaggeration.

The provided information consists of five sources related to United Nations resolutions concerning Israel and Palestine.

Information 1 is a Wikipedia article listing various UN resolutions related to Israel, including condemnations of violence against Palestinians, deportations, and refusal to cooperate with the UN.

Information 2 is an article from UN Watch, a non-governmental organization, which reports on the number of UN General Assembly resolutions passed in 2022, with 15 resolutions targeting Israel and 13 targeting the rest of the world.

Information 3 is an article from The Times of Israel, which states that in 2022, the UN General Assembly passed more resolutions critical of Israel than against all other nations combined. It also mentions that since 2015, the General Assembly has adopted 140 resolutions criticizing Israel, while only 68 resolutions have been passed against all other countries.

Information 4 is another Wikipedia article, this time listing UN resolutions related to Palestine, including condemnations of Israel's actions and affirmations of Palestinian rights.

Information 5 is a Quora answer that mentions Israel has ignored more UN resolutions than any other country, but does not provide specific numbers or details.

**Analysis of the CLAIM**

The claim made by Ron DeSantis on January 11, 2018, states that in one year, the United Nations passed 24 resolutions, with 20 of them being against Israel.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the claim is partially supported. Information 2 and 3 suggest that the UN General Assembly has indeed passed a disproportionate number of resolutions targeting Israel. In 2022, 15 out of 28 resolutions (53.6%) targeted Israel, which is a significant proportion. Similarly, since 2015, the General Assembly has adopted 140 resolutions criticizing Israel, which is more than twice the number of resolutions passed against all other countries combined.

However, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim (24 resolutions, with 20 against Israel) are not directly supported by the provided information. It is possible that the claim refers to a specific year or time period not mentioned in the provided information.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I would classify the claim as PARTIALLY TRUE. While the claim's general assertion that the UN passes a disproportionate number of resolutions targeting Israel is supported, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim are not directly supported by the provided information.

Title: Small Business or Big Business: Which Really Creates the Most Jobs?
Content:
Large businesses have also been heralded as those that are creating the most jobs by researchers. Small businesses, which account for 99.7% of all companies, generate less than 2/3 of the U.S.’s new jobs. This means that the largest .3% of companies create one out of every three new jobs, more than pulling their weight.
They found that existing firms actually lost around 1,000,000 more jobs than they added every year from 1977 to 2005. This is due to the majority of employers being uninterested in growing past a certain point. Research done by the University of Chicago showed that only one in four small business are interested in expanding.
Some business leaders have suggested that the government should encourage big companies to pull back on outsourcing- something large corporations are prone to do- by decreasing the U.S.’s corporate tax rate. In theory, bringing down the rate would make businesses more likely to bring jobs back to the country.
The authors of the report point out that, based on Census data, the proportion of new companies compared to all U.S. Businesses has been steadily decreasing. In the late 1970s, new companies represented a significantly higher percentage compared to their representation by 2011, which was only 8%.

But what about startups, the supposed source of American economic renewal? It turns out that most startups don’t actually create that many jobs either.

As Scott Shane, an entrepreneurship expert and author of “The Illusions of Entrepreneurship,” writes in his book, “Only 1 percent of people work in companies less than two years old, while 60 percent work in companies more than ten years old.” · The majority of small companies actually shed jobs after their first year. One study found that among small companies in their second, third, fourth, and fifth years of business, more jobs were lost to bankruptcy than were added by those still operating. This is why the mean number of workers per firm actually goes down every year after a firm is born.
Rather, most small business owners have no desire to grow their firms. Nearly three-quarters of individuals who start a business want to keep their businesses small. Surveys show that the lion’s share of people who start businesses do so not because they want to be a rich entrepreneur, something that takes enormous dedication and hard work to achieve; rather, most don’t want to work for a boss.
Despite Birch later admitting that his results were a “silly number” that he could change “at will by changing the starting point or the interval,” his claim has been endlessly repeated, like an urban myth, getting larger and larger, and even being garbled into claims that small business is responsible for all job creation. Years later, the sentiment is still being hammered into the American psyche by small-is-beautiful advocates and presidents on both sides of the aisle.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles discussing small businesses and their role in job creation in the United States. Here's a summary of each article:

1. **Forbes Advisor (2024-04-29)**: The article highlights the importance of small businesses in the American economy, citing their role in job creation, innovation, and economic growth. It also mentions the computer systems and design industry, which is projected to add over 574,000 jobs in the next decade.
2. **Small Business or Big Business: Which Really Creates the Most Jobs? (2024-01-05)**: This article challenges the notion that small businesses create the most jobs. It cites research showing that large businesses create one out of every three new jobs, and that small businesses, despite accounting for 99.7% of all companies, generate less than two-thirds of new jobs.
3. **Debunking the Myth of Small Business Job Creation (2022-10-21)**: This article argues that the idea that small businesses are the primary drivers of job creation is a myth. It cites studies showing that most startups don't create many jobs, and that small business owners often have no desire to grow their firms.
4. **Facts & Data on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (2022-05-07)**: This article provides various statistics on small businesses, including their role in job creation.

It states that small businesses generate 1.5 million jobs every year and employ 61.2 million Americans, accounting for 46.8% of jobs in the US.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states that small businesses "create two out of every three American jobs." Based on the provided information, this CLAIM appears to be **FALSE**.

While small businesses do play a significant role in job creation, the evidence suggests that they do not create two out of every three American jobs. Information 2 and 3 challenge the notion that small businesses are the primary drivers of job creation, citing research that shows large businesses also create a significant number of jobs. Information 4 provides statistics on small businesses' role in job creation, but these statistics do not support the CLAIM. Information 5 presents various statistics on small businesses, but again, these statistics do not support the CLAIM.

In fact, Information 2 states that large businesses create one out of every three new jobs, which contradicts the CLAIM. Additionally, Information 3 argues that the idea that small businesses are the primary drivers of job creation is a myth.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM appears to be an exaggeration and should be classified as **FALSE**.

Title: How Ukraine’s Orange Revolution shaped twenty-first century geopolitics - Atlantic Council
Content:
The point of departure in this deteriorating relationship between Russia and the West was the 2004 Orange Revolution, which set the tone for everything that has since transpired. Indeed, it is no accident that while Moscow’s own actions have grown more and more belligerent, the Kremlin has continued to accuse Western countries of plotting a so-called “color revolution” inside Russia. Even the term itself is a backhanded compliment that hints at the enduring influence of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution on Russian policy-making.
The fact that this didn’t happen is down to the millions of ordinary Ukrainians who took to the streets in November 2004 and demanded to be heard. Their courage has long since been forgotten, but the uprising they led has left its mark on the wider world and been instrumental in shaping today’s escalating showdown between Russia and the West. As the archetypal “color revolution,” Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution lives on in the nightmares of the Russian elite and deserves far more recognition as one of the great geopolitical turning points of the early twenty-first century.
Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution is often overlooked but it is worthy of more attention as one of the great geopolitical turning points of the early twenty-first century that set the stage for today's Cold War climate.
Ukrainians marked the Day of Dignity and Freedom on November 21, continuing a seven-year tradition that seeks to place the country’s 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution in a broader historical context. This might also be something for the international community to consider. While Ukraine’s two people power uprisings are recognized as important milestones in the country’s post-Soviet journey, their impact on the wider region has yet to be fully appreciated.

Title: Orange Revolution - Wikipedia
Content:
The Orange Revolution (Ukrainian: Помаранчева революція, romanized: Pomarancheva revoliutsiia) was a series of protests, that lead to political upheaval in Ukraine from late November 2004 to January 2005. It gained momentum primarily due to the initiative of the general population, sparked by the aftermath of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election run-off which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption, voter intimidation and electoral fraud.
The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by Ukraine's Supreme Court for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be "free and fair". The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych's 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kyiv, the Orange Revolution ended.
Persistent rumours suggested that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had ordered the killing. Gen. Oleksiy Pukach, a former police officer, was accused of the murder under the orders of a former minister who committed suicide in 2005. Pukach was arrested in 2010 and was sentenced to life in prison in 2013. The murder sparked a movement against Kuchma in 2000 that may be seen as the origin of the Orange Revolution in 2004.
The murder sparked a movement against Kuchma in 2000 that may be seen as the origin of the Orange Revolution in 2004. After two terms of presidency (1994–1999) and the Cassette Scandal of 2000 that significantly damaged his image, Kuchma decided not to run for a third term in the 2004 elections and instead supported Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential race against Viktor Yushchenko of the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc.
After a clear lack of faith in the government had been instilled in the Ukrainian population, Yushchenko's role had never been more important to the revolution. Yushchenko was a charismatic candidate who showed no signs of being corrupt. Yushchenko was on the same level as his constituents and presented his ideas in a "non-Soviet" way. Young Ukrainian voters were extremely important to the outcome of the 2004 presidential election.

Since achieving independence in August 1991, Ukraine's leaders have advocated building a democratic, free-market society with strong relations with its Russian neighbor and deeper relations with Europe.

Title: Ukraine's two different revolutions - BBC News
Content:
In 2004-2005 mass protests lasting for two months - the Orange Revolution - helped bring to power pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko, who defeated his rival Viktor Yanukovych in a repeat run-off election.
None of them seems to enjoy the full trust of the demonstrators - unlike 2004, when Mr Yushchenko's name became the main slogan of the Orange Revolution. That is why the new protests are sometimes described as "horizontal", rather than top-down, and truly social.
Ukrainians are back on the streets nine years after the Orange Revolution - voicing similar aims but with a hardened sense of reality.
But you see almost no children on the streets of central Kiev, and many demonstrators wear plastic helmets and gas masks. That is miles away from the romantic feeling of the Orange Revolution.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION provided consists of five sources discussing the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which took place in 2004-2005. The sources agree that the Orange Revolution was a series of protests and political upheaval in Ukraine, sparked by the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, which was marred by corruption, voter intimidation, and electoral fraud. The protests, led by Viktor Yushchenko, ultimately resulted in the annulment of the original election results and a revote, which Yushchenko won.

The sources also highlight the significance of the Orange Revolution, describing it as a turning point in Ukraine's post-Soviet journey and a key event in shaping the country's relationship with Russia and the West. The revolution is characterized as a peaceful, popular uprising, with widespread participation from ordinary Ukrainians, particularly young people.

Now, to evaluate the <CLAIM> that the Ukraine Orange Revolution in 2004 "was the first color revolution," we need to examine the evidence.

While the sources do not explicitly state that the Orange Revolution was the first color revolution, they do suggest that it was a pioneering event in the context of post-Soviet Ukraine and Eastern Europe. The term "color revolution" is not explicitly defined in the sources, but it is implied to refer to a wave of popular, peaceful uprisings that swept through Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the early 2000s.

Given the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that the Orange Revolution was one of the earliest, if not the first, color revolutions in the region. However, without further evidence or a clear definition of what constitutes a "color revolution," it is difficult to definitively classify the CLAIM as TRUE or FALSE.

To further investigate, it would be helpful to explore other sources that discuss the concept of color revolutions and their chronology in the region.

To get an on-the-ground view of how staffing shortages are affecting schools, the Brown Center on Education Policy invited four district superintendents to share their challenges and attempts to meet them. Dr. Curtis Cain is superintendent of Wentzville School District in Wentzville, Missouri; Quincy Natay is superintendent of Chinle Unified School District in Chinle, Arizona; Dr. Kamela Patton is superintendent of Collier County Public Schools in Naples, Florida; and Dr. Noris Price is superintendent of Baldwin County School District in Milledgeville, Georgia.

For that, the governor needs to bring his social service agencies — or what is left of them — to the conversation. Increased infrastructure costs explain another 5 cents of the increase, and are aggravated by ambitious but poorly thought out policy on PCB mitigation. We need the governor’s help on this, too.

A federal civil rights investigation could force a Texas suburb to implement the same types of diversity programs that voters rejected in landslide elections.
In response to a grievance Edmiston filed against the district over its handling of her son’s case, a senior Carroll administrator acknowledged in writing that the school should have opened a formal investigation into Christian's bullying allegations back when he first reported them in the spring of 2021. The district denied Edmiston’s request to discipline the principal who handled the case, noting that he and other principals had since been retrained in how to investigate student allegations.
He said the district shares the goal of protecting marginalized students and creating a culture where every child feels safe and welcomed, and has been striving to make that a reality in recent years. Flowers, who is Black, also serves as head football coach at Daniel Boone Area High School. In his administrative role, he hosts regular diversity and inclusion lectures and training sessions for students and staff. The goal, he said, is to establish a culture of respect and acceptance in the majority-white school district.
SOUTHLAKE, Texas — After the Department of Education’s civil rights enforcement arm announced in November that it was investigating students’ allegations of discrimination and bullying at the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, conservative parents and politicians were outraged. Southlake Mayor John Huffman issued a statement suggesting that the federal investigation might have been launched to retaliate against the city for electing three school board members who opposed a plan for new diversity and inclusion training programs, which they characterized as a ploy to indoctrinate students with critical race theory.

We have a great culture of stability and success in all areas and we’re extremely proud of our school. Besides attracting new hires and retaining them, Supt. Morgan says a four-day school week does wonders for his district's mental health.
(KOKH) — Two rural school districts will be having four-day school weeks after the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) approved their waivers. Thanks to the OSDE’s approval, Roff Public Schools is about to enter their eighth year of having four-day school weeks. "For us, it’s a big deal," Superintendent Scott Morgan said.
We are very proud of our report card scores and the achievements of our district that allow for this waiver. The approval from the State Board of Education for this waiver allows us flexibility in our school calendar to remain on a 4-Day week while still meeting statutory requirements.
Morgan says a shorter week helps his district fill staff positions. "We have had this type of calendar since we did it for the first year in 2017. In those last few years, especially in the midst of one of the largest teacher shortages our state has ever seen, we find that this schedule has allowed us to draw phenomenal educators in an area where we compete with much larger schools to draw in that talent.

The <CLAIM> states that the Scott administration has rejected all 44 plans submitted, affecting 90 school districts. However, Information 3 provides context about Governor Scott's veto of a yield bill, which suggests that the governor is involved in budget decisions affecting school districts. While it does not directly support or refute the <CLAIM>, it does indicate that Governor Scott is involved in decision-making related to school districts.

The other pieces of INFORMATION do not provide direct evidence to support or refute the <CLAIM>. Therefore, based on the available information, I would classify the <CLAIM> as UNVERIFIED. More information is needed to determine the accuracy of the <CLAIM>.

Title: When will I be required to show a photo ID to vote? | BRING IT TO THE BALLOT | Wisconsin Elections Commission
Content:
You will need to show an original copy of an acceptable photo ID to vote at your polling place or to cast an in-person absentee ballot at your municipal clerk's office.
You will also be required to provide a photocopy of your ID to cast an absentee ballot by mail, with certain exceptions for military and permanent overseas voters and permanent absentee voters.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information relates to voter identification requirements in Wisconsin and other states. Specifically:

* Information 1 lists the acceptable forms of photo identification for voting in Wisconsin, including driver's licenses, identification cards, university/college IDs, and veteran's IDs.
* Information 2 provides an overview of voter identification laws by state, stating that 35 states require voters to present identification at the polls, with 24 of those states requiring a photo ID.
* Information 3 appears to be unrelated to voter identification and is likely an error.
* Information 4 reiterates the acceptable forms of photo identification for voting in Wisconsin and provides contact information for assistance.
* Information 5 explains when and how voters in Wisconsin need to show a photo ID to vote.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM made by Terry Moulton on April 28, 2011, is **FALSE**. The information from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and other sources clearly indicates that Wisconsin does require a photographic identification to vote. In fact, Wisconsin is one of the 35 states that require voters to present identification at the polls, and one of the 24 states that require a photo ID.

The CLAIM is outdated and incorrect, as Wisconsin has had a voter photo ID law in place since 2011. The law uses existing photo IDs, such as driver's licenses and identification cards, to prove identity before voting.

Title: Economy of Russia - Wikipedia

Russia's inequality of household income and wealth has remained comparatively high over time, which has been significantly caused by the large variance between Russian geographic regions and their differing levels of energy reserves. For instance, the nation's Gini coefficient was 36 in 2020 in comparison to the value of 39.8 in 2021 within the United States. Russia has the world's 5th-largest number of billionaires.
Russia's vast geography is an important determinant of its economic activity, with the country holding a large share of the world's natural resources. It has been widely described as an energy superpower; as it has the world's largest natural gas reserves, 2nd-largest coal reserves, 8th-largest oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe. It is the world's leading natural gas exporter, the 2nd-largest natural gas producer, the 2nd-largest oil exporter and producer and third largest coal exporter. Russia's foreign exchange reserves are the world's 5th-largest.
The mineral-packed Ural Mountains and the vast fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal), and timber reserves of Siberia and the Russian Far East make Russia rich in natural resources, which dominate Russian exports. Oil and gas exports, specifically, continue to be the main source of hard currency. Russia has been widely described as an energy superpower; as it has the world's largest natural gas reserves, the second-largest coal reserves, the eighth-largest oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe.
In 2019, It was the world's fourth-largest nuclear energy producer. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian state nuclear conglomerate Rosatom became the dominant actor in international nuclear power markets, training experts, constructing nuclear power plants, supplying fuel and taking care of spent fuel in around the world.
There is also such an indicator as the oil rent (% of GDP), which is published by the World Bank. It is 9.7% for Russia, 14.8% for Kazakhstan, 6.1% for Norway, 23.7% for Saudi Arabia, 15.7% for the United Arab Emirates, 2.8% for Canada and 0.6% for the United States.

Russia is a major player in global energy markets. It is one of the world's top three crude oil producers, vying for the top spot with Saudi Arabia and the United States. In 2021, Russian crude and condensate output reached 10.5 million barrels per day (barrels per day), making up 14% of the world's total supply.
Russia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves. This is 32% of world proven natural gas reserves (23% of the probable reserves), 12% of the proven oil reserves, 10% of the explored coal reserves (14% of the estimated reserves) and 8% of the proven uranium reserves.
Russia was also the world's fourth-largest nuclear energy producer in 2019, and was the fifth-largest hydroelectric producer in 2021. Russia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves.
In 2007, Gidro OGK, a subsidiary of the Unified Energy System (UES) began the installation of a 1.5 MW experimental orthogonal turbine at Kislaya Guba. If it proves successful, UES plans to continue with Mezen Bay (15,000 MW) and Tugur Bay (7,980 MW) projects. Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after China, the United States, and India.
Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after China, the United States, and India. In 2020, Russia produced 1,085 TWh and exported 20 TWh of electricity. Roughly 60% of Russia's electricity is generated by fossil fuels, 20% by hydroelectricity, 20% by nuclear reactors. Renewable energy generation is minimal.

The only two nations on this list that actually produce more oil than they consume are Russia and Saudi Arabia, both of whom are top trading partners to the United States and the European Union. The two nations don't just cover their own needs — they have A LOT of petroleum left over. This probably makes them less inclined to shift to renewables. While Russia is the fifth largest producer of hydroelectric energy in the world (a renewable resource), the nation has barely scratched the surface with other renewable sources of energy.
While Russia is the fifth largest producer of hydroelectric energy in the world (a renewable resource), the nation has barely scratched the surface with other renewable sources of energy. Saudi Arabia generates none of its electricity from renewable resources. While much has been made about the dangers of natural gas extraction (fracking certainly has its flaws), the United States has seen a huge boom in its natural gas industry in the last decade. The United States surpassed Russia as the top producer of natural gas in 2008. Russia and the United States are also top consumers, together accounting for 34.3 percent of the all natural gas use.
Russia produces much more natural gas than it needsm while the United States is almost producing as much as it consumes. Iran makes a podium appearance as the third largest consumer of natural gas. In fact, Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world, so it's probably a resource they plan on using for a while.

Title: Russia, China and the Geopolitics of Energy in Central Asia - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
Content:
China’s modernization and rise as a superpower depends on securing reliable access to natural resources. Beijing has responded to this imperative by making the worldwide search for energy one of foreign policy priorities. Just as Russia will rely on energy exports for the foreseeable future, so China will remain a net importer of oil and other sources of energy, such as gas and nuclear fuel.
The United States is equally concerned about an energy link between Russia and China, but for different reasons: it fears that energy could be at the heart of a strategic rapprochement between Beijing and Moscow. However, as this report shows, the energy relationship between Russia and China is a lot more complex than their respective positions as producer and consumer would imply. In fact, the bilateral energy relationship between the two countries is remarkably underdeveloped.
Russia is the world’s biggest hydrocarbon producer. China is one of the world’s biggest and fastest growing energy markets. Moreover, the two are neighbors, which means that energy transport is relatively straightforward, without the need for either risky sea shipments or pipelines that transit several countries.
China is one of the world’s biggest and fastest growing energy markets. Moreover, the two are neighbors, which means that energy transport is relatively straightforward, without the need for either risky sea shipments or pipelines that transit several countries. A long-term strategic energy relationship between the two looks not only commercially viable but almost inevitable. European policy-makers have in the past reacted with concern whenever Russian leaders alluded to the option of “turning to the east” by redirecting oil and gas flows away from Europe and towards emerging markets in Asia, principally China.

Summary of the INFORMATION:

The provided information discusses Russia's economy, energy resources, and production. Key points include:

* Russia has a high level of income and wealth inequality, largely due to regional differences in energy reserves.
* Russia is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, coal, and timber, which dominate its exports.
* Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, second-largest natural gas producer, second-largest oil exporter and producer, and third-largest coal exporter.
* Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, second-largest coal reserves, and eighth-largest oil reserves.
* Russia is also a significant producer of nuclear energy and hydroelectric power.
* The country's energy resources are a major determinant of its economic activity.
* Russia is the fifth-largest producer of hydroelectric energy in the world, but has barely developed other renewable energy sources.

Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:

The CLAIM states that the United States is number one in the world in energy resources, and Russia is number two. Based on the provided information, this CLAIM appears to be FALSE.

While the United States is a significant energy producer, the information suggests that Russia has the largest natural gas reserves, second-largest coal reserves, and eighth-largest oil reserves in the world. Additionally, Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, second-largest natural gas producer, second-largest oil exporter and producer, and third-largest coal exporter.

The information does not provide a comprehensive ranking of countries by energy resources, but it suggests that Russia's energy resources are more extensive than those of the United States. Therefore, it is unlikely that the United States is number one in energy resources, and Russia is number two.

It is worth noting that the CLAIM is from 2011, and the energy landscape may have changed since then. However, based on the provided information, the CLAIM appears to be incorrect.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information revolves around a claim made by Sean Hannity on August 23, 2016, stating that in 2015, "illegal" immigrants accounted for 75 percent of federal drug possession convictions and 5 percent to 30 percent of convictions for murder and kidnapping plus two other crimes.

Information 1 and 2 are identical and describe Hannity's presentation of a slide on his show, featuring Donald Trump, which listed the percentage of "illegal immigrant federal convictions" in fiscal 2015 for five crimes.

Information 3 is from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and provides data on criminal noncitizens arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol from Fiscal Years 2017 to 2024. However, it does not provide specific data for 2015.

Information 4 is a fact-check article from 2016 that examines Hannity's claim. It provides data on federal crime convictions in 2015, stating that "illegal aliens" accounted for 37 percent of all federal crime convictions, including 75 percent of simple drug possession convictions, 30 percent of kidnapping/hostage taking convictions, and 21 percent of national defense crime convictions.

Information 5 is a list of fact-checks from PolitiFact, including Hannity's claim from August 23, 2016.

**Evidence and Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM made by Sean Hannity appears to be partially TRUE. According to Information 4, "illegal aliens" did account for 75 percent of federal drug possession convictions in 2015, which supports Hannity's claim. However, the claim also states that "illegal" immigrants accounted for 5 percent to 30 percent of convictions for murder and kidnapping plus two other crimes, which is not entirely supported by the available data.

While Information 4 provides some data on federal crime convictions in 2015, it does not provide a comprehensive breakdown of convictions for all five crimes mentioned in Hannity's claim. Therefore, without additional evidence, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the entire claim.

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as PARTIALLY TRUE, with some aspects supported by evidence and others lacking sufficient evidence to confirm or deny.

Also, when Hoover's term ended, he left office with a massive unemployment rate of 24.9%, according to The New York Times.
In April 2020, the number of unemployed Americans rose sharply at the onset of the pandemic, to nearly 15%. (For comparison's sake, again, the unemployment rate rose during the Great Depression to around 24.9% in 1932.) By December 2020, the rate had fallen to 6.7%.

This makes the Great Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis. Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, we project global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 percent. This recovery in 2021 is only partial as the level of economic activity is projected to remain below the level we had projected for 2021, before the virus hit.
The world has changed dramatically in the three months since our last update of the World Economic Outlook in January. A rare disaster, a coronavirus pandemic, has resulted in a tragically large number of human lives being lost.
Under the assumption that the pandemic and required containment peaks in the second quarter for most countries in the world, and recedes in the second half of this year, in the April World Economic Outlook we project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period. This makes the Great Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis.

This recovery in 2021 is only partial as the level of economic activity is projected to remain below the level we had projected for 2021, before the virus hit. The cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around 9 trillion dollars, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany, combined. This is a truly global crisis as no country is spared.

The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in the history of the industrialized world, lasting from the stock market crash of 1929 to 1939.
Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943. When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. In 1935, Congress passed the Social
And those relief programs for which African Americans were eligible on paper were rife with discrimination in practice since all relief programs were administered locally. Despite these obstacles, Roosevelt’s “Black Cabinet,” led by Mary McLeod Bethune, ensured nearly every New Deal agency had a Black advisor. The number of African Americans working in government tripled. There was one group of Americans who actually gained jobs during the Great Depression: Women.
With Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode. This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level.

Title: Chapter 5: Americans in Depression and War By Irving Bernstein | U.S. Department of Labor
Content:
The only significant public program consisted of a group of uneven state workmen's compensation laws dealing with job related illness and disease. The Great Depression energized the impulse for social insurance. The two key movements were for unemployment insurance and old-age pensions. Wisconsin pioneered in enacting an unemployment insurance law in 1932. The need for pensions prompted the Townsend Plan, which emerged in 1933 and quickly won large public support. Under this nostrum, the government would pay everyone sixty years old or over $200 a month on the condition that the pension was spent within a month.

This general language appeared to provide legal protection of workers' rights to form and join free trade unions while denying employers the right to impose company unions or employee representation plans as they were then known upon the workers. The labor movement had been weak in the twenties, and the suffering of the Great Depression had given workers a deep sense of grievance.
An anomaly of the time was that the government did not systematically collect statistics on joblessness, actually did not start doing so until 1940. The Bureau of Labor Statistics later estimated that 12,830,000 persons were out of work in 1933, about one-fourth of a civilian labor force of over fifty-one million. March was the record month, with about fifteen and a half million unemployed. There is no doubt that 1933 was the worst year, and March the worst month for joblessness in the history of the United States.

Title: Is This Really the Worst Economic Recovery Since the Depression? - The New York Times
Content:
Economists often assert that we are in the worst recovery since the Great Depression. Are we? Not technically, but it’s still unusually bad. Certainly the economy is in an abysmal state, and we still have about five million fewer jobs than we had when the recession began in December 2007. But the level of economic activity is so low chiefly because the recession itself was so severe; indeed, on many economic indicators, the Great Recession was the deepest (and longest) downturn since the Great Depression.
Not technically, but it’s still unusually bad. That especially stings because rarely is a sharp recession followed by a lackluster recovery.
Certainly the economy is in an abysmal state, and we still have about five million fewer jobs than we had when the recession began in December 2007. But the level of economic activity is so low chiefly because the recession itself was so severe; indeed, on many economic indicators, the Great Recession was the deepest (and longest) downturn since the Great Depression. Technically, though, economists use the word “recovery” (or “expansion”) to refer to the state of the economy after a recession ends.
If you’re looking for a way in which this business cycle does overshadow every other one since World War II, consider this: It’s not unusual to have a steep downturn and then a steep recovery. It’s also not unusual to have a shallow downturn and then a slow recovery. But not since the Great Depression — also precipitated by a financial crisis — have we had a sharp downturn followed by a slow recovery. We lucked into the worst of both worlds.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION provided consists of five sources discussing the Great Depression, job growth, and economic downturns. 

Information 1 from Snopes.com (2024-04-17) compares job growth during Trump's presidency to the Great Depression, stating that when Trump left office in January 2021, U.S. job growth had dipped, and unemployment had soared to its highest peak since the Great Depression.

Information 2, titled "The Great Lockdown: Worst Economic Downturn Since the Great Depression," describes the 2020 pandemic-induced recession as the worst since the Great Depression, with a projected global growth rate of -3% in 2020 and a partial recovery to 5.8% in 2021.

Information 3 from HISTORY (2023-10-20) provides an overview of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, and its effects on the economy and society.

Information 4 from the U.S. Department of Labor discusses the Great Depression's impact on the labor movement and the need for social insurance, including unemployment insurance and old-age pensions.

Information 5 from The New York Times (2012-08-10) examines whether the economic recovery since the 2007 recession is the worst since the Great Depression, concluding that while it's not technically the worst, it's still unusually bad due to the severity of the recession.

Now, to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM> based on the available information:

The <CLAIM> states, "This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression." The claimant is Herman Cain, and the publication date is September 15, 2011.

Based on the provided INFORMATION, there is evidence to support the <CLAIM>. Information 2 describes the 2020 pandemic-induced recession as the worst since the Great Depression, and Information 5 from The New York Times (2012-08-10) suggests that the economic recovery since the 2007 recession is unusually bad. Additionally, Information 1 from Snopes.com (2024-04-17) compares job growth during Trump's presidency to the Great Depression, stating that unemployment had soared to its highest peak since the Great Depression.

While the <CLAIM> is from 2011, and the other INFORMATION pieces are from later dates, the general trend and descriptions of economic downturns and job recoveries in the INFORMATION pieces support the idea that the jobs recovery during that time period was indeed one of the worst since the Great Depression.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE.

That assumption — that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown — turned out not to be accurate. But I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality — even that one. And that’s what we did.  · So, we were ready when the Afghan Security Forces — after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own — did not hold on as long as anyone expected.  · We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our Allies.
It was time to be honest with the American people again. We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan.  · After 20 years of war in Afghanistan, I refused to send another generation of America’s sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago.
We faced one of two choices: Follow the agreement of the previous administration and extend it to have — or extend to more time for people to get out; or send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war. To those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask: What is the vital national interest? In my view, we only have one: to make sure Afghanistan can never be used again to launch an attack on our homeland. Remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place?
Most tragically, we see it in the shocking and stunning statistic that should give pause to anyone who thinks war can ever be low-grade, low-risk, or low-cost: 18 veterans, on average, who die by suicide every single day in America — not in a far-off place, but right here in America.  · There’s nothing low-grade or low-risk or low-cost about any war. It’s time to end the war in Afghanistan.

By contrast, the Taliban today are usually assessed at a strength of 20-40,000 fighters, of whom only around one-fourth are full-time combatants, and who have to date deployed little or no precision weaponry.\14\ The size of the insurgent force is not necessarily the most important variable in COIN, but against the commonplace assumption that the Soviet experience will be America's fate in Afghanistan, we must keep in mind that the situation the United States faces is less dire in important respects-- including the strength of the insurgent enemy.
I, like a lot of other Senators, in the last couple of months had a chance to go to both Afghanistan and Pakistan for a limited period of time, but, even in a short amount of time, you learn a lot, or at least you gain better insights. I was particularly impressed by a lot of the fighting men and women who were there starting with the briefing General McChrystal as well as the nonmilitary folks gave us.

Originally based in Afghanistan but squeezed by allied military operations, many in this shadowy alliance have shifted to Pakistan's cities and frontier areas, beyond easy reach of the coalition.

Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021 — just a little over three months after I took office. U.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001. The choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.
After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. That’s why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency. But I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated. So what’s happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.
The choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season. There would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1. There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict.

Today, thousands of interpreters and their families await visas to the U.S., while Taliban fighters parade triumphantly in captured tanks and humvees paid for by Uncle Sam. In the 20 years since September 11, 2001, the United States has spent more than $2 trillion on the war in Afghanistan.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources related to the war in Afghanistan. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. **Human and Budgetary Costs to Date of the U.S. War in Afghanistan, 2001-2022**: The United States has spent $2.313 trillion on the war in Afghanistan, which includes operations in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This total does not include funds for lifetime care for American veterans or future interest payments on borrowed money.
2. **Remarks by President Biden on the End of the War in Afghanistan**: President Biden explains the decision to end the war in Afghanistan, citing the lack of a clear purpose and the high cost of continuing the war. He mentions the tragic statistic of 18 veterans dying by suicide every day in the United States.
3. **Exploring Three Strategies for Afghanistan**: This source discusses the strength of the Taliban, estimated to be 20-40,000 fighters, and the situation in Afghanistan, including the role of Pakistan. It also mentions the impressions of Senators who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan.
4. **Remarks by President Biden on Afghanistan**: President Biden discusses the unfolding situation in Afghanistan, including the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and military. He explains the choice he had to make between following through on the agreement to withdraw U.S. forces or escalating the conflict.
5. **The War In Afghanistan Cost America $300 Million Per Day For 20 Years, With Big Bills Yet To Come**: This article highlights the massive financial cost of the war in Afghanistan, estimated to be over $2 trillion. It also mentions the human cost, including 2,500 U.S. military deaths, 4,000 U.S. civilian contractor deaths, and tens of thousands of Afghan military, police, and civilian deaths.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states that "it costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place." While the provided information does not directly support or refute this CLAIM, we can analyze the available data to make an informed judgment.

The information suggests that the war in Afghanistan has been extremely costly, with estimates ranging from $2.313 trillion (Information 1) to over $2 trillion (Information 5). These figures are staggering, and it's reasonable to assume that the logistical costs of fighting in Afghanistan are higher than in other places.

However, the CLAIM specifically states that it costs three times more to fight in Afghanistan than in any other place. Without more specific data or comparisons to other military operations, it's challenging to verify this exact claim.

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **UNVERIFIED**. While the war in Afghanistan has been extremely costly, the specific claim of a threefold increase in logistical costs compared to other places lacks concrete evidence to support or refute it.

While supporting both Trump's nominees for EPA administrator, she expressed concern over their commitment to the Renewable Fuel Standard. She rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. Ernst has opposed a federal minimum wage and advocated for the elimination of federal departments such as the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. Ernst was born Joni Kay Culver in Montgomery County, Iowa, the daughter of Marilyn and Richard Culver.
In endorsing her for the Republican primary nomination, the Des Moines Register wrote: "Ernst is a smart, well-prepared candidate who can wrestle with the details of public policy from a conservative perspective without seeming inflexible." On October 23, Ernst canceled a scheduled meeting with the Des Moines Register's editorial board, citing the paper's negative editorials about her. The editorial board ultimately endorsed Braley, citing Ernst's calls to abolish the EPA, the Department of Education, and the federal minimum wage, as well as her support for partially privatizing Social Security and overturning the Affordable Care Act.
As a state senator, Ernst co-sponsored a resolution urging the "nullification" of EPA rules on emissions standards and another expressing the Iowa General Assembly's "refusal to recognize" federal laws "which conflict with the Second Amendment". In 2012, she answered "Yes" to a survey asking whether she would support legislation "nullify[ing] ObamaCare and authoriz[ing] state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it]."
In the Iowa Senate, she co-sponsored a bill to amend the state constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman. In 2017, she announced her opposition to Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces. Ernst was one of 12 Republican senators to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate on November 29, 2022.

DES MOINES — Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, won re-election on Tuesday, overcoming a serious and well-financed Democratic challenge and pockets of discontent with President Trump to score a victory that bolstered her party’s efforts to save its Senate majority.
With the future of the Senate hanging in the balance, more than $233 million had poured into the race from around the country — with spending almost evenly split between supporters of the two candidates. The victory preserved Ms. Ernst’s status as one of the highest-ranking women in Republican politics, poised to help shape the course of the party for at least the next six years. “She’s now part of Iowa’s politics for the foreseeable future,” said Christopher W. Larimer, a professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa.

As a result, each trigger pull only discharges a single round from a semi-automatic weapon, as opposed to a fully automatic weapon, which will shoot continuously as long as the ammunition is replete and the trigger is kept depressed. Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher produced the first successful design for a semi-automatic rifle in 1885, and by the early 20th century, many manufacturers had introduced semi-automatic shotguns, rifles and pistols.

Although Mannlicher earned his reputation with his bolt-action rifle designs, he also produced a few semi-automatic pistols, including the Steyr Mannlicher M1894, which employed an unusual blow-forward action and held five rounds of 6.5mm ammunition that were fed into the M1894 by a stripper clip.

A semi-automatic, or self-loading, firearm is a weapon that performs all steps necessary to prepare the weapon to fire again after firing—assuming cartridges remain in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Typically, this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the weapon's firing chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber.
There are semi-automatic pistols, rifles, and shotguns designed and made as semi-automatic only. Selective fire firearms are capable of both full automatic and semi-automatic modes. The M14, produced at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, was the United States standard issue selective fire weapon for eleven years (1957–1968).
Another gas-operated semi-automatic rifle developed toward the end of WWII was the SKS. Designed by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in 1945, it came equipped with a bayonet and could be loaded with ten rounds, using a stripper clip. However, the SKS was quickly replaced by the AK-47.

Ultimately, automatic rifles would become standard in military usage, as their firepower was superior to that of a semi-automatic rifle, but both semi-automatics and even bolt actions are still used worldwide in military service in specific roles, such as designated marksman rifles where the greater accuracy compared to automatics is valued. Furthermore, to accommodate for this greater firepower, battle rifles were mostly replaced by assault rifles, whose lighter bullets allowed more to be carried at once, but where semi-automatic rifles continue to be used, they are usually in higher calibers, such as the .50 BMG Barrett M82. Semi-automatic weapons use gas, blow-forward, blowback or recoil energy to eject the spent cartridge after the round has moved down the barrel, chambering a new cartridge from its magazine, and resetting the action.
After failing trials a new design was developed labeled as the M1896 Flaadens Rekylgevær. It was tested by the Danish military and found to be reliable enough and 60 were procured for the Danish navy making it one of the first military adopted semi auto rifles.
It was tested by the Danish military and found to be reliable enough and 60 were procured for the Danish navy making it one of the first military adopted semi auto rifles. In the final years of the 19th century and early 20th century experiments and patents with Gas-operated reloading were developed from Hiram Maxim and Richard Paulson as well a gas operated conversion system from an American inventor called Henry Pitcher. Designs also developed such as the Cei-Rigotti in 1900.
Automatic firearms would only become feasible after smokeless powder became widespread. Mannlicher's designs were, nonetheless, the forerunner of automatic rifles and served as a base for a number of future weapons, such as Browning machine guns (M1917, M1919 and M2).
The Soviet AVS-36, SVT-38, and SVT-40, as well as the German Gewehr 43, were semi-automatic gas-operated rifles issued during World War II in relatively small numbers. In practice, they did not replace the bolt-action rifle as a standard infantry weapon of their respective nations - Germany produced 402,000 Gewehr 43 rifles, and over 14,000,000 of the Kar98k. Another gas-operated semi-automatic rifle developed toward the end of World War II was the SKS. Designed by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in 1945, it came equipped with a bayonet and could be loaded with ten rounds, using a stripper clip.

Despite its early failures, the M16 proved to be a revolutionary design and stands as the longest continuously serving rifle in American military history.
The air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle was made of steel, aluminum alloy and composite plastics, truly cutting-edge for the time. Designed with full and semi-automatic capabilities, the weapon initially did not respond well to wet and dirty conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat. After a few minor modifications, the weapon gained in popularity among troops on the battlefield."
Germany eventually purchased the license for the CETME design and manufactured the Heckler & Koch G3 as well as an entire line of weapons built on the same system, one of the most famous being the MP5 SMG. The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 ("assault rifle" vs "battle rifle") came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammunition to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47.
Although U.S. Army studies of World War II combat accounts had very similar results to that of the Germans and Soviets, the U.S. Army failed to recognize the importance of the assault rifle concept, and instead maintained its traditional views and preference for high-powered semi-automatic rifles. At the time, the U.S. Army believed that the Sturmgewehr 44 was "intended in a general way to serve the same purpose as the U.S. carbine" and was in many ways inferior to the M1 carbine, and was of "little importance". After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 Carbines, M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, M3 "Grease Gun" and Thompson submachine gun.
The barrel and overall length were shorter than a traditional rifle and it had a pistol grip to hold the weapon more securely in automatic fire. "The principle of this weapon—the reduction of muzzle impulse to get usable automatic fire within the actual ranges of combat—was probably the most important advance in small arms since the invention of smokeless powder."

New York had an assault weapons ban prior to 2013, but on January 16 of that year it passed the SAFE Act, which created a stricter definition of assault weapons and banned them immediately. The NY SAFE Act defines assault weapons as semi-automatic pistols and rifles with detachable magazines and one military-style feature, and semi-automatic shotguns with one military-style feature.
After the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, many news organizations ran stories about assault weapons, explaining their varying definitions and presenting varying opinions about whether they should be banned again at the federal level. Drawing from federal and state law definitions, the term assault weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features.
Dictionary.com defines "assault weapon" as "any of various automatic and semiautomatic military firearms utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge, designed for individual use". The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary's definition is "any of various automatic or semiautomatic firearms; especially: assault rifle". The origin of the term is not clearly known and is the subject of much debate. In the past, the names of certain military weapons used the phrase, such as the Rifleman's Assault Weapon, a grenade launcher developed in 1977 for use with the M16 assault rifle, or the Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon, a rocket launcher introduced in 1984.
This included semi-automatic rifles with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a flash suppressor or threaded barrel, a bayonet mount, or a muzzle-mounted grenade launcher. It included semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, or an unloaded weight of 50 ounces or more.
Connecticut defines assault weapons as selective-fire firearms (including assault rifles capable of fully automatic or burst fire); semi-automatic firearms specified by name; and semi-automatic firearms with specific characteristics. Hawaii defines and bans assault pistols.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information discusses semi-automatic firearms, their history, design, and military use. Here's a concise summary:

* Semi-automatic firearms are designed to fire a single round with each trigger pull, eject the spent cartridge, and load a new round from the magazine. (Information 1 and 2)
* The first successful semi-automatic rifle was designed by Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher in 1885. (Information 1)
* Semi-automatic pistols, rifles, and shotguns were developed and used by various militaries, including the United States Army, which adopted the semi-automatic M1911 handgun in 1911. (Information 1)
* The SKS, a semi-automatic rifle designed by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in 1945, was the first widely issued weapon to use the 7.62×39mm cartridge. (Information 1 and 2)
* Selective-fire firearms, capable of both full automatic and semi-automatic modes, were also developed. (Information 1 and 2)
* The M14, a semi-automatic rifle, was the United States standard issue selective fire weapon from 1957 to 1968. (Information 2)
* Semi-automatic rifles, such as the Soviet AVS-36, SVT-38, and SVT-40, and the German Gewehr 43, were issued during World War II in limited numbers. (Information 3)
* The M16, an assault rifle with full and semi-automatic capabilities, was developed in the United States and became a revolutionary design. (Information 4)
* The term "assault weapon" refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns with detachable magazines and one or more military-style features. (Information 5)

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield" can be classified as **PARTIALLY TRUE**.

While it is true that many semi-automatic firearms were designed and used by militaries, not all semi-automatic weapons were designed specifically for military use on the battlefield. The information suggests that semi-automatic firearms were developed for various purposes, including civilian use, and were later adopted by militaries.

The CLAIM is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the complexity of semi-automatic firearm development and use. The information provided highlights the diverse origins and applications of semi-automatic firearms, including their use in military, civilian, and sporting contexts.

Therefore, while the CLAIM contains some truth, it is not entirely accurate and should be classified as PARTIALLY TRUE.

Here's a party who have always stood for fiscal restraint, a smaller government, lower taxes and a strong national defense. … · But there is no question we didn't do a good job on restraining the growth of government, and we spent a lot of money we didn't have. Things like the [Medicare] Part D drug program were truly a big mistake from the standpoint of fiscal policies. The Part D drug program alone added an $8 trillion unfunded liability to the federal books.
That's not entirely fair, because the downturn in the economy in 2001 was not the doing of President Bush, really, in any definition. … We got this bubble in the stock market, and the bubble peaked in early 2000, when President Clinton was still in office. And then it started to lose air.

Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing.

An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter. According to the 2016 Social Security Administration Trustees Report, payments will be cut by 23% under current law around 2035, if no reforms are made to the program. President Bush advocated the Ownership society, premised on the concepts of individual accountability, smaller government, and the owning of property.
Among the many stated rationales for the large income tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was the 2001 recession, which followed the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in late 2000 and early 2001. Further, some influential conservatives such as Alan Greenspan believed that the nearly $5 trillion in budget surpluses forecast by the CBO for the 2002-2011 period should be given back to taxpayers rather than used to pay down the national debt.
CBO reported that debt held by the public, a partial measure of the national debt, rose from $3.41 trillion in 2000 (33.6% GDP) to $5.80 trillion in 2008 (39.3% GDP). However, CBO had forecast in 2001 that debt held by the public would fall to $1.0 trillion by 2008 (7.1% GDP).
Measured for fiscal years 2001–2008, Federal spending under President Bush averaged 19.0% of GDP, just below his predecessor President Bill Clinton at 19.2% GDP, although tax receipts were substantially lower at 17.1% GDP versus 18.4% GDP. Income tax revenues averaged 7.7% GDP under Bush, versus 8.5% GDP under Clinton. The sizable national debt increases during his administration represented a reversal from a sizable surplus projection by the Congressional Budget Office just prior to his taking office.

Title: Donald Trump Built a National Debt So Big (Even Before the Pandemic) That It’ll Weigh Down the Economy for Years
Content:
The “King of Debt” promised to reduce the national debt — then his tax cuts made it surge. Add in the pandemic, and he oversaw the third-biggest deficit increase of any president. by Allan Sloan, ProPublica, and Cezary Podkul for ProPublica Jan. 14, 2021, 5 a.m. EST
Steuerle examined the records of 45 presidents to see how the primary deficit had shrunk or grown relative to the size of the economy between the first and final years of each president’s administration. Trump had the third-biggest primary deficit growth, 5.2% of GDP, behind only George W. Bush (11.7%) and Abraham Lincoln (9.4%). Bush, of course, not only passed a big tax cut, as Trump has, but also launched two wars, which greatly inflated the defense budget.
The growth in the annual deficit under Trump ranks as the third-biggest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any U.S. presidential administration, according to a calculation by a leading Washington budget maven, Eugene Steuerle, co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And unlike George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw the larger relative increases in deficits, Trump did not launch two foreign conflicts or have to pay for a civil war.
Falling deeper into the red is the opposite of what Trump, the self-styled “King of Debt,” said would happen if he became president. In a March 31, 2016, interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Trump said he could pay down the national debt, then about $19 trillion, “over a period of eight years” by renegotiating trade deals and spurring economic growth.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information discusses the national debt of the United States and its growth under various presidents, including George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.

Information 1 highlights that President George W. Bush added around $4 trillion to the national debt, largely due to military spending and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also mentions that President Ronald Reagan added over $1.6 trillion to the national debt.

Information 2 provides a chart showing the increase in national debt under different presidents. It states that during Donald Trump's presidency, the national debt increased by $8.18 trillion, a 40.43% increase. However, it notes that Trump was in office for only 4 years, compared to 8 years for both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The information also mentions that President Bush added $6.1 trillion to the nation's debt, a 105% increase.

Information 3 is an analysis from PBS, which discusses the growth of national debt during the Bush years. It quotes an economist estimating that the Iraq War alone cost around $3 trillion. The analysis also criticizes the Republican Party for not being good stewards of the government and the national debt.

Information 4 is from Wikipedia and discusses the economic policy of the George W. Bush administration. It mentions that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.

Information 5 is an article from ProPublica, which discusses the growth of national debt under Donald Trump. It notes that Trump's tax cuts and the pandemic led to a significant increase in the national debt. The article also mentions that Trump had the third-biggest primary deficit growth, behind only George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states that under President George W. Bush, "the national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion." Based on the provided information, this CLAIM appears to be partially TRUE.

Information 2 states that President Bush added $6.1 trillion to the nation's debt, taking the national debt from $5.8 trillion in 2001 to $11.9 trillion in 2009, a 105% increase. This is close to the CLAIM's assertion that the national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion under Bush's presidency.

However, it's worth noting that the CLAIM's exact figures are not entirely accurate. The national debt did not exactly go from $5 trillion to $12 trillion under Bush's presidency. Nevertheless, the CLAIM's general assertion that the national debt increased significantly under Bush's presidency is supported by the provided information.

Therefore, based on the available information, the CLAIM is classified as TRUE, with some minor inaccuracies in the exact figures.

Title: Did Obamacare ‘massively’ increase the cost of health care? - The Washington Post
Content:
During Trump’s first presidency, the devil was in the details — Republicans had trouble crafting a law that didn’t cost millions of Americans their health coverage, increase insurance premiums or weaken protections for people with preexisting health conditions. For this fact check, we are going to focus on two specific claims Jindal made about health-care costs — that because of Obamacare “premiums have increased 80 percent” and “total health-care cost for a family of four has increased by $12,000 a year.” These are repurposed talking points from previous GOP attacks on the law — which are highly misleading.
In any case, health analysts agree that Obamacare’s role in slowing the growth in premium costs is a relatively minor one. But just as you can’t fully credit the law for reducing prices, neither can you blame it for “massively” increasing prices. The law’s biggest success has been its intended main purpose — reducing the number of Americans without health insurance. Jindal earns Three Pinocchios. ... The Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles
For reference, the Treasury also will lose more than $5.3 trillion because employer-provided health insurance is tax-free, the CBO says. With that background in mind, let’s look at the America First Institute video. Jindal, in the video, accuses Obamacare of creating an “affordability crisis” for families. Before he introduces the numbers, he rolls some clips of Obama appearing to promise that health-care premiums would decline: “Families will save on their premiums … cut the average family’s premium … lower your premiums … reducing premiums … work to lower your premiums.” All but one of these clips is from Obama’s 2008 campaign, when he was pitching a plan different from the one he enacted as president.
For people who qualify based on income level, their premiums are rather low — about $100 a month after subsidies — and premiums have barely budged in the past five years, according to KFF. The percent of uninsured Americans has declined significantly in every state since implementation of the law, according a 2023 report by the health policy office of the Department of Health and Human Services. ...

Title: Overwhelming Evidence That Obamacare Caused Premiums To Increase Substantially
Content:
Two scholars at the renowned Brookings Institution, Loren Adler and Paul Ginsburg, have published an analysis finding that “average premiums in the individual market actually dropped significantly upon implementation of the ACA [Affordable Care Act].” This contrasts with a plethora of evidence, including a rigorous 2014 Brookings study, showing the ACA significantly increased premiums.
This comparison is problematic and misleading because CBO’s 2009 estimate involved significant and generally unforeseeable errors in key underlying assumptions. First, starting in the mid-2000s, health care inflation slowed and the extent of this slowdown, largely the result of the recession and weak economic recovery, was not anticipated by CBO in 2009.
The two-year increase (69%) is the product of the two single-year increases. The comparable PMPM cost increase in the employer market, which the ACA affected much less, amounted to about 11%. Assuming an 11% increase would have happened in the individual market absent the ACA, a very rough initial guess would be that the ACA increased individual market PMPM costs by about 58% between 2013 and 2015. As previously noted, premiums did not increase by this full 58% because of insurers’ large losses and the large subsidies they received.

In this post, I discuss methodological concerns with the Adler and Ginsburg approach as well as evidence that leads most scholars to reach a very different conclusion.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

Information 1: This article from PolitiFact fact-checks a claim made by Barack Obama in 2012 that health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years due to Obamacare.

Information 2: This article discusses the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on health care premiums, stating that while premiums did increase after the ACA was implemented, they have continued to increase at a much lower rate than in the past.

Information 3: This article from The Washington Post fact-checks a claim made by Bobby Jindal that Obamacare has "massively" increased the cost of health care, concluding that the claim is highly misleading and that Obamacare's role in slowing premium cost growth is relatively minor.

Information 4: This article from Ballotpedia provides data on health insurance premiums before and after the Affordable Care Act, including state-by-state analysis and rate changes for different age groups.

Information 5: This article presents evidence that Obamacare caused premiums to increase substantially, contradicting a Brookings Institution analysis that found average premiums in the individual market dropped significantly upon implementation of the ACA.

Now, to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM>, we can analyze the available information:

The <CLAIM> states that because of Obamacare, health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. Information 1 and 2 provide some support for this claim, suggesting that while premiums did increase after the ACA was implemented, the rate of increase has been slower than in the past. However, Information 3 and 5 present conflicting evidence, suggesting that Obamacare's impact on premium cost growth is relatively minor and that premiums have actually increased substantially due to the ACA.

Based on the available information, it is difficult to classify the <CLAIM> as definitively TRUE or FALSE. While there is some evidence to support the claim, there are also conflicting reports and analyses that suggest the impact of Obamacare on premium cost growth is more nuanced and complex than the claim suggests. Therefore, I would classify the <CLAIM> as PARTIALLY TRUE, with the caveat that the relationship between Obamacare and health care premium growth is likely more complex than the claim implies.

Can he under the law do that, without any crime involved? Can he do that?" Huppenthal: "No, he cannot. That would be -- that would just simply be racial profiling, and that would not be permitted under the law. Now, if he stopped them for speeding or something like that, he can inquire of the driver at that point if they were an illegal immigrant.

Title: PolitiFact | Arizona immigration law allows police to question 'anyone' who's 'reasonably suspicious' of being illegal
Content:
The new Arizona immigration law "says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person." ... When Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest immigration law on April 23, 2010, did it open the door for rampant racial profiling? ... Generally speaking, the law -- which would go into effect in 90 days -- makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.
Such profiles "entitle an officer to stop someone and say, 'I'd like to ask you some questions?' The officer can then investigate, which could lead to probable cause." And at that point, Spiro said, an immigration status check would be acceptable under the Arizona law. To be fair, it's not necessarily easy to use profiles in this way. Spiro said that the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. "You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic," Spiro said.

Spiro said that the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. "You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic," Spiro said. "There has to be some other factor or factors, not all of which are race-based, as well as some empirical explanation of why that profile establishes a reasonable suspicion. You have to come up with something beside race that sounds plausible as correlating with undocumented status, and it's hard to say what that would be."

Title: Arizona police will no longer stop people to check immigration status | Reuters
Content:
PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona police officers will no longer detain people solely to investigate their immigration status under a settlement reached on Thursday after a lawsuit challenged the so-called 'show your papers' provision of an immigration law. The settlement agreement ends a long and costly court battle between the state and civil rights groups over the 2010 law, which opponents say has led to racial profiling and wrongful detentions. “This makes it clear that you cannot detain someone even for a minute based on the belief the person is undocumented,” said Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the parties to the suit.
The measure, which required police officers to check the immigration status of everyone they stopped, sparked nationwide controversy when signed into law in April 2010 by then Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Business groups canceled conventions in Arizona and performers refused to play as protesters rallied throughout the Southwestern state. Arizona shares a 368-mile (592-km) border with Mexico and Brewer said the federal government was not doing enough to combat illegal immigration into Arizona.
Arizona shares a 368-mile (592-km) border with Mexico and Brewer said the federal government was not doing enough to combat illegal immigration into Arizona. The Obama administration challenged the law, saying the federal government had jurisdiction over immigration enforcement. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 partially struck down the law, including a provision requiring immigrants to carry paperwork at all times. But the high court upheld the law's most controversial section, which required police officers to check the immigration status of people they stop, even for minor offenses, the so-called 'show your papers' provision.
The guidelines to be used by local officers are contained in an informal opinion issued by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed with the court as part of the settlement to end the litigation of the controversial, first-in-the-nation law, commonly known as SB 1070. The measure, which required police officers to check the immigration status of everyone they stopped, sparked nationwide controversy when signed into law in April 2010 by then Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION provided relates to the Arizona immigration law, specifically regarding police stops and immigration status checks. Information 1 and 3 suggest that under the law, police cannot stop someone solely to check their immigration status, but rather must have reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed. Information 2 and 5 provide guidance on individual rights when interacting with police or immigration agents, including the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to inspect warrants. Information 4 reports on a settlement reached in 2016, which ended a court battle over the law's "show your papers" provision, and clarifies that police officers cannot detain someone solely to investigate their immigration status.

Based on this INFORMATION, I would classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE. The <CLAIM> states that under the new Arizona immigration law, police can't stop someone to check their immigration status unless they think they see something illegal. This is supported by Information 1 and 3, which indicate that police must have reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed before stopping someone to check their immigration status. Additionally, Information 4's settlement agreement reinforces this understanding, stating that police officers cannot detain someone solely to investigate their immigration status.

It's worth noting that the <CLAIM> is attributed to John Huppenthal, a GOP state senator, and is dated April 26, 2010, which is around the time the Arizona immigration law was signed into effect. This suggests that the <CLAIM> is a statement made by a key figure involved in the law's passage, and is consistent with the law's intended provisions.

Title: Small Business Confidence returns to last year’s all-time low as confidence in President Biden and the U.S. banking system declines: CNBC|SurveyMonkey
Content:
As their confidence in the banking system has weakened over the last quarter, the gap between those who express confidence and a lack of confidence widened from just one percentage point in Q2 to nine percentage points in Q3. Fewer small business owners now than in Q2 (48% vs. 53%) say it is easy for them to access the capital needed for their business to operate. The survey also highlights small business owners' views on organized labor unions, with few supporting growth in organized labor, especially at their own companies. Almost half of small business owners (47%) say labor unions today have "too much power and influence" and most small business owners (59%) would oppose an increase in unionization at their company, including forty-two percent who say they would strongly oppose such a change.

Title: Small Business Confidence drops to a new all-time low as inflation and recession concerns continue to plague small business owners: CNBC|SurveyMonkey
Content:
Almost half of small business owners (43%) say inflation is the biggest risk to their business right now, a new high over the past year and up from 38% last quarter. As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates in an effort to control rising inflation, the prospect of a recession looms large for America's small business owners. Just 26% of those surveyed say they have confidence in the Fed's ability to get inflation under control.
"Inflation now dominates concerns among small business owners, reversing the small gains in confidence we saw last quarter and dampening the overall economic outlook," says Jon Cohen, chief research officer at Momentive. "Whether we are officially in a recession or not, small business owners are feeling the sting of high prices and reporting a new low point in our Small Business Confidence Index."
The survey found overall confidence among small business owners at its lowest level since CNBC and SurveyMonkey began surveying them in 2017. The Small Business Confidence Index drops to a score of 42 in the third quarter, four points lower than the second quarter, and a point lower than the previous all-time low hit during the first quarter of 2021.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles related to small business confidence, published between 2022 and 2024. Here's a brief summary of each article:

1. **Information 1 (2024-06-11)**: The article discusses the NFIB's Small Business Economics Trends, which reports that 6% of small business owners found it harder to get a loan compared to previous attempts. Financing was cited as a top business problem by 6% of owners, the highest level since June 2010.
2. **Information 2 (2024-06-26)**: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that small business owner confidence has reached a post-pandemic high. Nearly half (46%) of small business owners expect to increase investment in the next year, and 73% expect their revenue to increase.
3. **Information 3 (2023-08-22)**: A CNBC|SurveyMonkey survey finds that small business confidence has returned to an all-time low, with fewer owners expressing confidence in the banking system and accessing capital for their business.
4. **Information 4 (No publication date)**: This article lacks a publication date and content, making it difficult to summarize.
5. **Information 5 (2022-08-03)**: A CNBC|SurveyMonkey survey reports that small business confidence has dropped to an all-time low due to inflation and recession concerns. Almost half of small business owners (43%) cite inflation as the biggest risk to their business.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Donald Trump on January 30, 2018, states that small business confidence is at an all-time high. However, the provided information suggests that this CLAIM is FALSE.

Information 5 (2022-08-03) and Information 3 (2023-08-22) indicate that small business confidence has dropped to an all-time low in 2022 and 2023, respectively. While Information 2 (2024-06-26) reports a post-pandemic high in small business owner confidence, it does not suggest an all-time high.

Information 1 (2024-06-11) provides a mixed picture, with some owners experiencing difficulties in accessing loans, while others are optimistic about their business prospects.

In conclusion, based on the available information, the CLAIM made by Donald Trump on January 30, 2018, is FALSE. Small business confidence has fluctuated over time, and there is no evidence to support the notion that it was at an all-time high in 2018.

Title: Obama’s pledge that ‘no one will take away’ your health plan - The Washington Post

The article noted that the Congressional Budget Office assumed that 10 million Americans would need to seek new insurance under the Senate version of the bill. Meanwhile, in the Republican weekly address on Aug. 24, 2009, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a doctor, made this point: “On the stump, the president regularly tells Americans that ‘if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.’ But if you read the bill, that just isn’t so. For starters, within five years, every health-care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage — one that your current plan might not match, even if you like it.”
After Obama made his speech before the AMA, the Associated Press ran a smart analysis — “Promises, Promises: Obama’s Health Plan Guarantee” — that demonstrated how it would be all but impossible for the president to keep that pledge. The article noted that the Congressional Budget Office assumed that 10 million Americans would need to seek new insurance under the Senate version of the bill.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five sources that discuss President Barack Obama's statements on healthcare plans during his presidency. The sources are from PolitiFact, WhiteHouse.gov, and The Washington Post, and they cover a range of dates from 2009 to 2021.

The main theme of the information is Obama's repeated assurances that "if you like your health care plan, you can keep it" under his healthcare proposal, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The sources provide quotes from Obama's speeches, weekly addresses, and interviews, as well as statements from his administration officials, such as HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and adviser Valerie Jarrett.

However, the information also highlights the limitations and exceptions to Obama's promise. For instance, the ACA's regulations and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates suggest that many Americans would need to seek new insurance plans, and that grandfathered coverage would diminish over time.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, it appears that Obama's claim "if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it" is partially true but also misleading.

On one hand, Obama and his administration officials repeatedly made this promise, and it was a key selling point for the ACA. The promise was intended to reassure Americans that they would not be forced to change their healthcare plans if they were satisfied with their current coverage.

On the other hand, the information reveals that there were significant exceptions and limitations to this promise. Many Americans would need to seek new insurance plans due to changes in the ACA's regulations, and grandfathered coverage would eventually diminish. Additionally, the administration's own officials, such as Valerie Jarrett, acknowledged that the promise was not absolute and that insurance companies could change plans, making it difficult for individuals to keep their existing coverage.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **MOSTLY FALSE**. While Obama's promise was technically true for some Americans, it was not universally applicable, and the exceptions and limitations were significant enough to render the promise misleading.

Title: FACT SHEET: The President’s Budget Cuts Taxes for Working Families and Makes Big Corporations and the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share | The White House
Content:
Ends Capital Income Tax Breaks and Other Loopholes for the Very Wealthy. The President’s Budget will end one of the most unfair aspects of our tax system—the fact that the tax rate the wealthy pay on capital gains and dividends is less than the tax rate that many middle-class families pay on their wages. Households making over $1 million—the top 0.4 percent of all households—will pay the same 39.6 percent marginal rate on their income just like a high-paid worker pays on their wages.
Already, the IRS has collected more than $500 million in unpaid taxes from fewer than 2,000 delinquent millionaires, launched enforcement action against 25,000 millionaires who have not filed a tax return since 2017, and started cracking down on high-end tax evasion like deducting personal use of corporate jets as a business expense. President Biden’s tax plan would build on this progress with reforms that will finally make the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. The President’s Budget: Requires Billionaires to Pay at Least 25 Percent of Income in Taxes. Billionaires make their money in ways that are often taxed at lower rates than ordinary wage income, or sometimes not taxed at all, thanks to giant loopholes and tax preferences that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.
Without these changes, billions in capital income would continue to escape capital gains taxation entirely. Requires Wealthy People to Pay their Fair Share Toward Medicare to Extend Medicare Solvency Indefinitely. The President’s Budget extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund indefinitely by modestly increasing the Medicare tax rate on incomes above $400,000, closing loopholes in existing Medicare taxes, and directing revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended, along with dedicating an amount equivalent to the savings from Medicare prescription drug reforms.
He has already secured historic legislation to make our tax code fairer, from enacting a corporate minimum tax so that billion-dollar companies can’t get away with paying $0 in Federal income taxes to giving the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) the tools it needs to make wealthy tax cheats pay the taxes they owe. President Biden will fight to stop Republican plans to add trillions to the deficit with tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and largest corporations. Republicans would rather add trillions to the national debt than take back even one dollar of the $150 billion annual rate cut corporations received under President Trump.

These changes were enormously tilted toward the rich and wealthy.23 While these increases were paired with an expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, the total package gave significantly greater savings to the wealthy and also made the U.S. tax code significantly more regressive.24 In 2013, a significant majority of the Bush tax cuts were made permanent with bipartisan support, locking in lower tax rates and deep cuts to the estate tax.25 These changes led to a significantly more regressive tax code than existed before the Bush tax cuts were enacted, and one that brought in vastly less revenue. President Donald Trump’s signature tax bill,26 enacted when Republicans gained control of the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017, will have cost roughly $1.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023.
The George W. Bush administration, empowered by a trifecta in 2001, enacted sweeping tax cuts that will have cost more than $8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023. The tax cuts lowered personal income tax rates across the board, both for labor income and for capital gains, and they significantly increased the untaxed portion of estates and lowered the estate tax rate.
President Donald Trump’s signature tax bill,26 enacted when Republicans gained control of the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017, will have cost roughly $1.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023. These tax cuts reduced personal income tax rates and permanently lowered the corporate tax rate, among other changes. Despite being paired with a further expansion of the child tax credit, the 2017 changes also largely benefited the wealthy, once again making the U.S. tax code significantly more regressive.27
The presence of both primary surpluses and growth rates that exceeded the Treasury interest rate created significant downward pressure on the debt ratio.8 · The nation’s fiscal pictured changed in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan enacted the largest tax cut in U.S. history,9 reducing revenues by the equivalent of $19 trillion over a decade in today’s terms. Although Congress raised taxes10 in many of the subsequent years of the Reagan administration to claw back close to half the revenue loss,11 the equivalent of $10 trillion of the president’s 1981 tax cut remained.

Title: After Decades of Costly, Regressive, and Ineffective Tax Cuts, a New Course Is Needed | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Content:
In addition, policymakers could end the “stepped-up basis” loophole by taxing capital gains of affluent households when assets are transferred to heirs. This would prevent the wealthy from permanently avoiding income tax on massive amounts of their income, helping to counter income and wealth inequality[46] and generating significant revenue that our nation needs. Policymakers should also consider rolling back other special tax breaks that primarily benefit high-income households.
Reforming the corporate tax — such as by partially reversing the law’s deep rate cut to 28 percent, or halfway between the pre-2017 law 35 percent and the current 21 percent rate — would make the tax code more progressive while generating substantial revenue to fund national priorities. The 2017 law’s international tax rules also require reforms to more effectively deter costly profit shifting and to better align with the global minimum tax agreement.[38] The 2017 law exempted certain foreign income of U.S. multinationals from U.S. tax and added several provisions, including the global intangible low tax income (GILTI) minimum tax, to try to limit incentives for foreign profit shifting.
Moreover, even when wealthy households do pay tax, they benefit from special low tax rates on capital income and other tax breaks that reduce their taxes. As a result of these policies, the progressive federal income tax breaks down at the very top of the income distribution.[44] To address this dynamic, policymakers could institute a tax similar to the 25 percent minimum tax on multimillionaires in President Biden’s 2023 budget proposal. The proposal would treat unrealized capital gains as taxable income for the wealthiest people in the country and includes several helpful features to mitigate concerns about liquidity or losses due to stock market declines.[45]
This would prevent the wealthy from permanently avoiding income tax on massive amounts of their income, helping to counter income and wealth inequality[46] and generating significant revenue that our nation needs. Policymakers should also consider rolling back other special tax breaks that primarily benefit high-income households. One of the simplest ways to do so is by taxing income from capital gains and dividends — which are highly concentrated at the top — at the same rates as wage and salary income.

Title: The 2017 Trump Tax Law Was Skewed to the Rich, Expensive, and Failed to Deliver on Its Promises | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Content:
Tax cuts enacted in the last 25 years — namely, those enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President Bush (most of which were made permanent in 2012) and those enacted in the 2017 tax law — gave windfall tax cuts to the wealthy, costing substantial revenue, limiting the investments made to address national priorities, and adding trillions to the national debt.[25] The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, which reduced individual income tax rates, taxes on capital gains and dividends, and the tax on estates, cost roughly 2 percent of GDP in 2010.[26] The 2017 law took revenues even lower: CBO estimated in 2018 that the 2017 Trump tax cut will cost $1.9 trillion over ten years, on top of the cost of the Bush tax cuts also in place.[27]
This cynical political calculation should not prevent policymakers from revisiting the corporate tax cuts as part of the 2025 tax debate alongside ending the expiring individual and estate tax provisions for high-income households and paying for any that are extended. The nation needs to raise more revenue, and the profligate corporate tax rate cut and the ways in which our tax code encourages companies to use offshore tax havens should be reined in.
This would mean reversing the regressive tilt of the 2017 law, raising more revenue, and correcting priorities to advance the interests of low- and moderate-income families across the country instead of those of wealthy shareholders. Several key principles should guide this new course: Tax cuts for people making over $400,000 should end on schedule.
Another new study by a team of economists from Harvard, Princeton, the University of Chicago, and the Treasury Department estimates that the corporate tax cuts — including the cut in the corporate tax rate, full expensing for capital investments, and international tax changes — led to nearly dollar-for-dollar revenue losses, even after accounting for increases in economic activity due to those cuts, contrary to proponents’ promises that the cuts would pay for themselves.[40] The study does not examine how the corporate rate cut impacted earnings for workers with low and moderate incomes.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles and fact sheets related to taxation, budget, and economic policies in the United States. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. The White House fact sheet (2024-03-10) outlines President Biden's budget plan, which aims to make the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. The plan includes ending capital income tax breaks, requiring billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes, and increasing the Medicare tax rate on incomes above $400,000.
2. The Center for American Progress article (2024-05-08) argues that tax cuts are primarily responsible for the increasing debt ratio. It highlights how tax cuts under Presidents Bush and Trump have benefited the wealthy and large corporations, leading to a more regressive tax code and reduced revenue.
3. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities article (2023-05-17) suggests that decades of costly, regressive, and ineffective tax cuts have led to income and wealth inequality. It proposes reforms, such as ending the "stepped-up basis" loophole, rolling back special tax breaks, and instituting a minimum tax on multimillionaires.
4. The article on "How Tax Cuts Affect the Economy" (no publication date) provides an overview of personal income taxes, employment taxes, and the impact of tax cuts on the economy. It notes that tax cuts reduce government revenues and lead to budget deficits or growth in government debt.
5. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities article (2024-06-13) critiques the 2017 Trump tax law, arguing that it was skewed to the rich, expensive, and failed to deliver on its promises. It suggests revisiting corporate tax cuts and ending individual and estate tax provisions for high-income households to raise more revenue.

**Analysis of the CLAIM**

The claim by Mark Warner (October 31, 2011) states that the U.S. would gain revenue by cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks. However, the provided information suggests that this claim is likely FALSE.

The articles and fact sheets highlight how tax cuts have historically benefited the wealthy and large corporations, leading to reduced revenue and a more regressive tax code. They also propose reforms to address income and wealth inequality, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes.

Cutting personal income tax rates in half would likely reduce government revenue, exacerbate income inequality, and increase the national debt. Ending tax breaks might generate some revenue, but it would depend on the specific breaks being targeted and the impact on different income groups.

In contrast, the provided information suggests that increasing taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, as well as closing loopholes, could generate significant revenue and help address income and wealth inequality. Therefore, the claim that cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks would increase revenue appears to be incorrect.

Information 5 is a general overview of consumer protection laws in the US, explaining their purpose and scope. It mentions the role of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state agencies in enforcing consumer protection laws.

Now, let's evaluate the <CLAIM> based on the available information:

The <CLAIM> states that Suzanne Bonamici differed with her party on business legislation, consumer protection, and free trade agreements. While the provided INFORMATION does not directly confirm or deny this claim, it does provide context on consumer protection laws and regulations.

The INFORMATION suggests that consumer protection is a partisan issue, with Democrats being more pro-consumer and Republicans seeking to dismantle consumer protection agencies like the CFPB (Information 2). This context supports the possibility that Suzanne Bonamici, as a Democrat, may have differed with her party on consumer protection issues.

However, without more specific information about Suzanne Bonamici's stance on business legislation, consumer protection, and free trade agreements, it is difficult to classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE or FALSE with certainty. Further evidence or context would be needed to accurately evaluate the claim.

But the Iraqi fighting resumed as the Islamic State emerged as a potent force, and Obama sent American forces back into Iraq. About 5,000 Americans are now there, mostly training the Iraqis and working on the air campaign against ISIS.

McCain said he was frustrated by the slowness of McChrystal's assessment. "Why should it take weeks and weeks to make an evaluation and reach a decision?" he demanded, when Obama had laid out the new counterinsurgency strategy in March. Mullen said that McChrystal has found conditions on the ground in Afghanistan to be tougher than he expected, and that the evaluation was complicated by the fact that it extended to the needs of the NATO troops as a whole, rather than just the Americans.
Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-MI) pressed for faster action to build up and train Afghanistan's army and police forces, to supply them with arms and equipment, and to get lower-level insurgents to switch loyalties from the Taliban to their own local defense forces. Levin said those actions would demonstrate the U.S. commitment to success in the war "while avoiding the risks associated with a further increase in U.S. ground combat troops." The senior Republican on the committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said he strongly disagreed with the idea that the U.S. should take a "wait and see" approach before sending more American troops to Afghanistan.
Levin said the military should focus on persuading insurgents in Afghanistan to switch sides. Mullen acknowledged that, until recently, the plan hasn't been "an area of focus." But he said British Lt. Gen. Graeme Lamb has been named to head a program aimed at reconciling Pashtun insurgents who now support the Taliban.

As part of next year's defense budget, McCain calls for adding to the 8,400 American troops now deployed in Afghanistan and giving U.S. commanders greater authority to target Taliban insurgents and ISIS militants.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles related to the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan during the Obama administration. Here's a brief summary of each article:

1. (2016-07-06) - The article discusses President Obama's announcement to keep 8,400 American troops in Afghanistan, a higher number than initially planned. It highlights the challenges in withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, citing the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq.
2. (2016-07-07) - This article reports on President Obama's decision to maintain 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, a slower drawdown than initially planned. It mentions the U.S. goal of building an Afghan force capable of securing the country.
3. (No publication date) - A brief article stating President Obama's plan to keep 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through January.
4. (2009-09-15) - The article discusses a Senate committee hearing where General Stanley McChrystal's assessment of the situation in Afghanistan is being evaluated. Senators Carl Levin and John McCain express differing opinions on the need for more troops in Afghanistan.
5. (2017-08-12) - The article reports on Senator John McCain's proposal for a new strategy in Afghanistan, which includes adding troops to the existing 8,400 and giving U.S. commanders greater authority to target Taliban and Islamic State militants.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM states that "McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan." To evaluate this CLAIM, we need to examine the information provided.

From Information 4 (2009-09-15), we see that Senator John McCain was advocating for more troops in Afghanistan, while Senator Carl Levin was pushing for a focus on building up Afghan forces and persuading insurgents to switch sides. This suggests that McCain was initially in favor of increasing troop presence in Afghanistan.

Fast-forward to Information 5 (2017-08-12), where McCain proposes a new strategy for Afghanistan, which includes adding troops to the existing 8,400. This indicates that McCain still supports increasing troop presence in Afghanistan.

Now, let's look at Obama's position on troop levels in Afghanistan. From Information 1 (2016-07-06) and Information 2 (2016-07-07), we see that President Obama initially planned to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan but eventually decided to maintain a higher number of troops (8,400) than initially planned.

Based on the provided information, it appears that McCain's position on increasing troop presence in Afghanistan has been consistent, while Obama's position evolved over time. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that "McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan." Instead, it seems that Obama's position shifted to align more closely with McCain's initial stance.

This comes after years of public policies that limited domestic energy development and required us to get involved in messy situations around the world just to maintain access to oil and natural gas. And now we are on the verge to offer Eastern Europe much of its energy supplies so that these emerging democracies aren’t held hostage by their previous masters in Moscow. The world will be safer thanks to energy development here in the U.S. A decision to expand opportunities for domestic offshore energy development, should the exploration show that these resources abound off our coast, could be a significant economic boon for Virginia.
Let’s protect our current and future generations by expanding opportunities for offshore energy development in the Mid-Atlantic, which will benefit individuals and businesses here in Virginia and all across America. We can do this using new technologies for finding what amounts of natural gas and oil and sitting off our coast to develop.
Virginia’s opportunity to greatly benefit from offshore natural gas and oil development had life breathed back into it by President Trump’s decision to pursue these valuable resources off our Atlantic coast. First, we need to find out what amounts of natural gas and oil is on the Outer Continental Shelf – at 50 miles off the shores.
And Virginia, with the deepest sea port on the Atlantic, could become the “Energy Capital of the East Coast.” In addition to being home to offshore industry suppliers and their supporting infrastructure, our strategically-located deep water port with the largest dry docks in the country, provides a ready-made mechanism to bring natural gas and oil ashore for processing and transporting to markets throughout our country and even to our allies overseas.

Or are we going to push this opportunity onto other states or other nations that are eager to welcome the investment, high-paying jobs and tax revenue? Offshore exploration and development are safe. Both here and abroad, we are reminded that offshore production can, and does, co-exist with tourism and robust fishing and maritime industries. Popular but misplaced concerns about whether offshore operations might interfere with defense activities aren’t new — and there is another side to the story.
Despite increased domestic energy production and more affordable prices at the gas pump, the need to explore offshore is as great as ever. Just 10 years ago, the United States was more dependent on energy imports than ever before. Maintaining our energy security — and building upon it — means continuing to explore and develop. Will Virginia add to the nation’s energy security and reap the potential benefits of offshore development? Or are we going to push this opportunity onto other states or other nations that are eager to welcome the investment, high-paying jobs and tax revenue?

Title: Offshore drilling on the Atlantic coast of the United States - Wikipedia
Content:
The federal government had scheduled a lease sale for offshore Virginia, to take place in 2011, and in March 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration. However, lease sale plans were canceled in May 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
In June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the oil companies in the Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States, 530 U.S. 604 (2000), and ordered the federal government to repay $158 million. The government paid, and the companies relinquished the leases. About 30 wells explored the Baltimore Canyon Trough, about 100 miles (160 km) off the coast of New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. In one area, five wells tested significant flows of gas from Jurassic rocks, at rates as high as 18.9 million cubic feet per day.
Cuba has three producing offshore oil fields within 5 km of its north coast opposite Florida. The US Geological Survey estimates that the North Cuba Basin contains 5.5 billion barrels (870,000,000 m3) of undiscovered petroleum liquids and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, almost all in the offshore part of the basin. The issue of allowing oil and gas exploration offshore Florida became a hotly contested topic in the 2008 US elections.
Offshore drilling for oil and gas on the Atlantic coast of the United States took place from 1947 to the early 1980s. Oil companies drilled five wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. None of the wells were completed as producing wells.
Oil companies drilled five wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. None of the wells were completed as producing wells. All the leases have now reverted to the government. Although no oil or gas have been produced from beneath U.S. Atlantic waters, there are active offshore fields to the south in offshore Cuba and to the north in offshore Canada.

Title: Oil Resources in Virginia
Content:
New commercial-scale hydrocarbon discoveries in Virginia, if any, may generate natural gas or natural gas liquids rather than oil. Even offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, the potential for gas is higher than for oil. The General Assembly passed legislation in 2020 that banned state agencies from authorizing any use of state-owned submerged lands within three miles of the coastline for either oil and gas development.9
Virginia has known reservoirs of both oil and natural gas west of the Blue Ridge. In addition, there may be undiscovered petroleum resources in Upper Devonian black shales underneath Paleozoic thrust sheets (comparable to producing fields in east-central Kentucky), in Triassic basins east of the Blue Ridge, and in Triassic basins and other sediments underneath the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Most speculation is associated with the offshore potential in areas which could be leased by the Federal government.
Some oil is produced from liquids that condense at natural gas wells in the Appalachian Plateau. Efforts to find commercial quantities of oil further east in the Triassic basins of the Piedmont have failed - so far. In the Richmond Basin, 38 exploratory holes were drilled between 1897 and 1985.
You don't have big voids full of oil like they got out in the West or in the Middle East. Production here is generally pretty small and short-lived. time-temperature model for generating oil/gas from organic material in source rocks underneath Lee County, Virginia Source: Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, Oil and Gas Well Data and Geology for Lee County, Virginia (Publication 113) Some oil is produced from liquids that condense at natural gas wells in the Appalachian Plateau.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles and a claim related to offshore oil and natural gas development in Virginia. Here's a summary of each information piece:

Information 1 (2022-05-23): The article discusses the potential benefits of offshore energy development in Virginia, including increased energy security, economic growth, and job creation. It highlights the state's strategic location and infrastructure, making it an ideal hub for offshore energy development.

Information 2 (2019-08-06): This article emphasizes the economic benefits of opening the Atlantic's Outer Continental Shelf to offshore oil and natural gas development. It argues that offshore exploration and development are safe and can coexist with tourism and fishing industries.

Information 3 (2024-04-06): This Wikipedia article provides a historical overview of offshore drilling on the Atlantic coast of the United States. It mentions the cancellation of lease sales in 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the existence of producing offshore oil fields in Cuba.

Information 4 (No publication date): This article discusses oil resources in Virginia, highlighting the potential for natural gas or natural gas liquids discoveries rather than oil. It mentions the existence of known reservoirs of oil and natural gas in the state and the possibility of undiscovered resources.

Information 5 (No publication date): This API press release announces the formation of the "Explore Offshore" coalition, which supports increased access to offshore U.S. oil and natural gas resources. It highlights the potential benefits of offshore development in Virginia, including job creation, private investment, and state revenue.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The claim states that Virginia has the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore. Based on the provided information, this claim appears to be **FALSE**.

Information 3 reveals that offshore drilling for oil and gas on the Atlantic coast of the United States took place from 1947 to the early 1980s, with 51 exploratory wells drilled on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. Although none of these wells were completed as producing wells, it indicates that other states on the East Coast have already explored for and attempted to produce oil and natural gas offshore.

Additionally, Information 4 suggests that Virginia's potential for oil and natural gas discoveries is more focused on natural gas or natural gas liquids rather than oil. While there may be opportunities for offshore development in Virginia, the claim that it would be the first state on the East Coast to do so is not supported by the available information.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to Vice President Joe Biden's involvement with transparency and accountability in the US government.

Information 1 (2010) reports on Vice President Biden's meeting with the chairman of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board, which was closed to the press. The article questions the transparency of the meeting, citing the irony of a closed meeting with a transparency board.

Information 2 (no publication date) describes Vice President Biden's efforts to increase the transparency and quality of reports from Recovery Act funding recipients. The article highlights the importance of educating recipients and encouraging reports to provide unparalleled access to data on federal dollars at the local level.

Information 5 (no publication date) announces Vice President Joe Biden's role in overseeing the implementation of the Recovery Act's provisions and his appointment of Earl Devaney as Chair of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board.

**Evidence and Analysis of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Sarah Palin on February 6, 2010, states that Vice President Joe Biden's meeting "with the transparency and accountability board... was closed to the public."

Based on the provided information, there is evidence to support the CLAIM. Information 1 (2010) explicitly states that Vice President Biden's meeting with the chairman of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board was closed to the press, which implies that it was not open to the public. This meeting was scheduled for January 14, 2010, and the article highlights the irony of a closed meeting with a transparency board.

While the other pieces of information do not directly address the CLAIM, they do provide context on Vice President Biden's involvement with transparency and accountability issues during his time in office. Information 2 and 5 suggest that Vice President Biden was actively engaged in promoting transparency and accountability, particularly in relation to the Recovery Act. However, Information 3 and 4 raise questions about the Biden administration's commitment to transparency and accountability in other areas.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I classify the CLAIM as **TRUE**. The evidence from Information 1 supports the CLAIM that Vice President Joe Biden's meeting with the transparency and accountability board was closed to the public.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five articles related to Gov. Scott Walker's education policies and funding in Wisconsin. Here's a brief summary of each article:

1. The first article discusses Gov. Walker's claim that his 2017-2019 state budget funds K-12 education in Wisconsin at a historic level. While the raw number of $11.5 billion is the largest in state history, the article rates the claim as "Mostly False" because it doesn't account for inflation.
2. The second article examines a tweet by Mahlon Mitchell, a Democratic candidate for governor, who claimed that Gov. Walker cut $1.6 billion from education and is now putting back $638 million. The article finds that the claim is true, with the current budget containing about $638 million more in K-12 spending compared to the previous year.
3. The third article is the claim being evaluated, which states that under Gov. Walker's public-school budgets, a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those who came before them until they graduate from high school.
4. The fourth article criticizes Gov. Walker's education policies, stating that he enacted the largest per-student K-12 education cuts in the nation in his first budget and has aggressively pursued privatization.
5. The fifth article tests Gov. Walker's claim that Wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state. While the claim is true in raw dollars, it doesn't account for inflation, and the article rates it as "Mostly False."

**Evidence and Evaluation of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, there is evidence to support the claim made by Sondy Pope. The claim states that under Gov. Walker's public-school budgets, a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those who came before them until they graduate from high school.

Information 1 and 5 suggest that while Gov. Walker's budgets have increased funding for K-12 education, the increases are not sufficient to restore the funding levels that existed before his first budget. Information 2 confirms that Gov. Walker did cut $1.6 billion from education in his first budget and has only partially restored the funding. Information 4 highlights the significant cuts made to K-12 education in Gov. Walker's first budget and his pursuit of privatization.

Given this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim made by Sondy Pope is TRUE. Under Gov. Walker's public-school budgets, a student entering kindergarten would not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those who came before them until they graduate from high school, due to the significant cuts made to education funding in his first budget and the slow pace of restoration.

CLAIM: Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations.

Title: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority - Wikipedia
Content:
The BeltLine is a current proposal for the use of light rail and possibly bus or streetcar service on existing railroad rights-of-way around Atlanta's central business districts. The conversion of existing rail right-of-way to the proposed BeltLine also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing.
Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in Mobility 2030 a timeline by the Atlanta Regional Commission for improving transit through the year 2030. In March 2024, Mayor Andre Dickens announced that four new infill stations would be constructed across the network, including at Murphy Crossing – intersecting with the BeltLine – as well as at Krog Street, Joseph E. Boone, and Armour Yards.
In March 2024, Mayor Andre Dickens announced that four new infill stations would be constructed across the network, including at Murphy Crossing – intersecting with the BeltLine – as well as at Krog Street, Joseph E. Boone, and Armour Yards. On July 5, 2014, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 3-1 (Jeff Turner, Shana Rooks, and Sonna Gregory voting in favor,) approved a contract with MARTA to extend service to the county, financed by a 1 percent sales tax.
Adding another station to the existing line near Armour Yard (MARTA's main railyard, opened 2005) has also been discussed, as the Red and Gold MARTA lines, the northeast BeltLine light rail, proposed commuter rail lines to points northeast such as Athens (the "Brain Train") and Gainesville, would all pass through Armour Yard. Other stations that have been proposed are; Mechanicsville, Boone, Murphy Crossing, and Krog. The proposed Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal (MMPT) would be built next to Five Points station, connecting MARTA to surface passenger rail, including commuter rail, future intercity rail, Amtrak, and possible high-speed rail in the Southeast Corridor.
Construction began on MARTA's heavy rail system in 1975, with the first rail service commencing on June 30, 1979. The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines, as well as stations in Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, and North Springs, which were not included in the original plan. The missing rail segments from the original plan include a Tucker-North DeKalb line with service to Emory University and North Druid Hills, a Northwest line with service to Brookwood and Northside Drive, the extension of the West line to Brownlee-Boulder Park near Fairburn Road, the extension of the Proctor Creek line to West Highlands, and a branch off the south line to Hapeville and Clayton County.

If you look at this report (from a few years ago), they have studied and proposed 5 new infill stations as part of the More Marta referendum in 2016. It is highly likely that the 4 mentioned by the mayor will come from this list. (Murphy Crossing already being confirmed). ... The location of only one of the stations has been announced. Where do you think that the other three stations should go? ... Murphy Crossing, where the South (Red/Gold) Line crosses the BeltLine. Other places that MARTA and the BeltLine intersect are obvious choices:
Other places that MARTA and the BeltLine intersect are obvious choices: Krog Tunnel is the best site, especially if it includes better pedestrian access across the railroad tracks. The Eastside BeltLine is the busiest and most developed section. The neighborhoods on both sides of the tracks are fairly dense.
The money would come from the MARTA capital budget. That’s a different funding source than what will drive most of the streetcar expansion ... Rumor is the developer of Murphy Crossing may help foot the bill of the station. ... Makes sense. I think culdesac in AZ did something similar ... I don't know if the plan is to build stations at every intersection of the beltline...but if that's the case...they should proceed slowly with it.

Title: New infill MARTA stations to complement BeltLine rail - SaportaReport
Content:
But no existing heavy rail MARTA stations currently intersect with the BeltLine. That’s why Dickens’ proposal to add MARTA stations along the BeltLine, starting with Murphy Crossing, makes BeltLine rail even more critical to creating a more accessible and equitable city, according to Dixon.
Building rail on BeltLine’s eastside trail is just the first leg of what has been envisioned to have a circular 22-mile rail corridor along the entire right-of-way of the BeltLine. But no existing heavy rail MARTA stations currently intersect with the BeltLine.
Dixon, who lives within walking distance of Murphy Crossing, gave me a tour to show how the BeltLine intersects with MARTA. Ideally, one could get off a streetcar at Murphy Crossing and transfer to MARTA rail at a Murphy Crossing station. “Rail transit on the BeltLine was and has always has been the expectation, but we had no idea when that would manifest itself,” Dixon said.
In response to people who oppose a streetcar along the BeltLine, Greenwood said MARTA is studying various new technologies to make rail transit as welcoming as possible, including not having an overhead wire and having rail run on a grass bed rather than concrete. Again, as a city, we need to think about where we want to be decades from now. Developing new MARTA stations that intersect with a BeltLine transit system will greatly improve Atlanta’s mobility for people who want to get around without being in a car.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information relates to the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and the proposed BeltLine project in Atlanta. Here's a summary of the key points:

* The BeltLine is a proposed light rail or bus/streetcar service that will utilize existing railroad rights-of-way around Atlanta's central business districts. (Information 1)
* The project includes plans for three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the BeltLine. (Information 1)
* In March 2024, Mayor Andre Dickens announced four new infill stations would be constructed, including one at Murphy Crossing, which intersects with the BeltLine. (Information 1 and 2)
* The proposed stations are part of the More MARTA referendum in 2016, which studied and proposed five new infill stations. (Information 2)
* The BeltLine and MARTA intersect at several points, including Murphy Crossing, Krog Tunnel, and the Eastside BeltLine. (Information 2 and 5)
* MARTA CEO Collie Greenwood emphasized that the proposed stops would not be an alternative to the BeltLine streetcar project. (Information 4)
* The new infill MARTA stations, including Murphy Crossing, will complement the BeltLine rail and improve Atlanta's mobility. (Information 5)

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, the CLAIM "Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations" can be classified as **FALSE**.

The evidence from Information 1, 2, and 5 clearly shows that the BeltLine and MARTA intersect at multiple points, including Murphy Crossing, Krog Tunnel, and the Eastside BeltLine. Additionally, the proposed infill stations, including Murphy Crossing, will be built where the BeltLine intersects with existing MARTA lines.

The CLAIM, published in 2011, appears to be outdated and contradicted by the more recent information provided.

Sometimes this list is very short, with only one or two names, or the list may have 10 or more names listed.
As an example, for the last 20 years The American Legion and the Citizens Flag Alliance have approached various members of the House and Senate, requesting these members to introduce the flag-protection constitutional amendment. When a sponsor for legislation has been located, he or she becomes the chief advocate for this bill in the member's respective chamber. Sometimes this member is called the "primary sponsor." Under the rules of the U.S. Senate, multiple sponsorship of a piece of legislation is permitted.

The Senate, each Senator having one vote, chooses the Vice President from the two candidates having the largest number of votes for that office. Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited and proposed drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. Primary among these is the idea and draft conceived by a Member. This may emanate from the election campaign during which the Member had promised, if elected, to introduce legislation on a particular subject.
Cosponsors’ names may be deleted by their own unanimous-consent request or that of the primary sponsor. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship of a bill is permitted.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of text related to the U.S. Senate, legislation, and the legislative process.

Information 1 and 2 highlight the accomplishments of Republican Senators in the areas of healthcare, tax reform, national security, trade, education, and combating terrorism and human trafficking.

Information 3 explains the role of sponsors and co-sponsors in the legislative process, including the primary sponsor who introduces a bill and solicits colleagues to become co-sponsors.

Information 4 provides an overview of how laws are made in Congress, including the sources of ideas for legislation, the introduction of bills, and the role of sponsors and co-sponsors.

Information 5 describes the structure and powers of the Legislative Branch, including the Senate and the House of Representatives.

**Analysis of the CLAIM**

The claim made by Hillary Clinton is that almost every piece of legislation she introduced in the U.S. Senate had a Republican co-sponsor.

Based on the provided information, we can infer that:

1. Multiple sponsorship of a bill is permitted in the Senate (Information 2, 3, and 4).
2. A primary sponsor can solicit colleagues to become co-sponsors (Information 3).
3. The legislative process involves collaboration and bipartisanship (Information 1, 2, and 4).

While the information does not provide direct evidence to support or refute Clinton's claim, it suggests that bipartisan collaboration is a common aspect of the legislative process. Therefore, it is plausible that many of Clinton's introduced bills had Republican co-sponsors.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **LIKELY TRUE**. However, without specific data or records of Clinton's introduced bills and their co-sponsors, it is difficult to verify the claim with absolute certainty.

Here is a clear summary of the given INFORMATION:

The INFORMATION revolves around a phone call between then-President Donald Trump and Georgia's top elections investigator, Frances Watson, on December 23, 2020. The Washington Post initially reported that Trump told Watson to "find the fraud" and that she would be a "national hero" if she did so. However, after the Georgia secretary of state released an audio recording of the call, The Washington Post issued a lengthy correction, stating that Trump did not make those statements. Instead, Trump urged Watson to scrutinize ballots in Fulton County, asserting she would find "dishonesty" there, and told her that she had "the most important job in the country right now" and would be "praised" when the "right answer comes out".

Based on the available information, the <CLAIM> made by Maria Bartiromo that The Washington Post was "forced to correct what (Donald Trump) told the secretary of state of Georgia" is classified as TRUE. The correction was made after the release of the audio recording, which revealed that The Washington Post misquoted Trump's comments on the call. The correction was a significant one, as it changed the narrative of the story and showed that Trump's words were taken out of context.

As we have noted, a key part of the law is forcing insurers to offer an “essential health benefits” package, providing coverage in 10 categories. The list includes: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.
One might excuse the president for making an aspirational pledge as the health-care bill was being drafted, but it turns out he kept saying it after the bill was signed into law. By that point, there should have been no question about the potential impact of the law on insurance plans, especially in the individual market.

Value for Your Premium Dollar: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s 80/20 rule, if insurance companies don’t spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollar on medical care and quality improvements rather than advertising, overhead and bonuses for executives, they will have to provide you a rebate. Consumers have already received nearly $2 billion in rebates. Strengthening Review of Rate Increases: In every state, insurance companies are required to publicly justify their actions if they want to raise rates by 10 percent or more.

Title: Obama administration knew millions could not keep their health insurance
Content:
President Obama repeatedly assured Americans that after the Affordable Care Act became law, people who liked their health insurance would be able to keep it. But millions of Americans are getting or are about to get cancellation letters for their health insurance under Obamacare, say experts, and the Obama administration has known that for at least three years.Four sources deeply involved in the A
The consumers who are getting notices are in plans that do not provide all these protections – but in the vast majority of cases, those same insurers will automatically shift their enrollees to a plan that provides new consumer protections and, for nearly half of individual market enrollees, discounts through premium tax credits,” said White House spokesperson Jessica Santillo. “Nothing in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans: The law allows plans that covered people at the time the law was enacted to continue to offer that same coverage to the same enrollees – nothing has changed and that coverage can continue into 2014,” she said.
The White House does not dispute that many in the individual market will lose their current coverage, but argues they will be offered better coverage in its place, and that many will get tax subsidies that would offset any increased costs. “One of the main goals of the law is to ensure that people have insurance they can rely on – that doesn’t discriminate or charge more based on pre-existing conditions. The consumers who are getting notices are in plans that do not provide all these protections – but in the vast majority of cases, those same insurers will automatically shift their enrollees to a plan that provides new consumer protections and, for nearly half of individual market enrollees, discounts through premium tax credits,” said White House spokesperson Jessica Santillo.
“What the president said and what everybody said all along is that there are going to be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act to create minimum standards of coverage, minimum services that every insurance plan has to provide,” Carney said. “So it's true that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act.” · Other experts said that most consumers in the individual market will not be able to keep their policies. Nancy Thompson, senior vice president of CBIZ Benefits, which helps companies manage their employee benefits, says numbers in this market are hard to pin down, but that data from states and carriers suggests “anywhere from 50 to 75 percent” of individual policy holders will get cancellation letters.

Here is a summary of the provided information and an evaluation of the claim:

**Summary of Information:**

The provided information consists of five sources related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and President Obama's statements about keeping one's health care plan.

Information 1 (2017) highlights the Obama administration's efforts to improve health care, including reducing hospital readmissions and infections, improving care quality, and strengthening safety measures.

Information 2 (2021) fact-checks President Obama's statement that "no one will take away" your health plan, citing the ACA's essential health benefits package and the potential impact on insurance plans, especially in the individual market.

Information 3 (no date) lists 37 instances where President Obama or top administration officials said that people could keep their health care plan, highlighting the promise to allow Americans to keep their doctor and plan.

Information 4 (no date) outlines the benefits of the ACA, including value for premium dollars, strengthened review of rate increases, help with premium payments, lower-cost prescription drugs, coverage for young adults, and the Health Insurance Marketplace.

Information 5 (2013) reports that the Obama administration knew that millions of Americans could not keep their health insurance under the ACA, despite President Obama's assurances.

**Evaluation of the Claim:**

The claim states that the Obama Administration predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan, contradicting the promise that people could keep their health care plan.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the claim is partially TRUE. While President Obama and his administration repeatedly stated that people could keep their health care plan, the ACA's essential health benefits package and other regulations did lead to changes in insurance plans, especially in the individual market. Information 5 (2013) reveals that the Obama administration was aware that millions of Americans could not keep their health insurance under the ACA.

However, the claim's specific prediction of 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage losing their current health plan is not directly supported by the provided information. Information 5 cites experts estimating that 50 to 75 percent of individual policy holders would receive cancellation letters, but this does not necessarily translate to 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage.

In conclusion, while the claim is partially true in that the ACA did lead to changes in insurance plans, the specific prediction of 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage losing their current health plan is not fully supported by the provided information.

Content:
The cost of these wars over 20 years was estimated at around $8 trillion in September 2021. These wars began by President George W. Bush added significantly to our national debt during his presidency and the presidencies of Obama and Trump. The cost of the wars is also reflected in the yearly military budget, which reached record levels of more than $600 billion in 2009 as Bush's presidency ended.
Obama’s efforts to spur recovery from the Great Recession through his $832 billion stimulus package and $858 billion in tax cuts contributed to the rise in national debt during his presidency. Presidents who serve longer terms often have larger changes in the debt than those who serve shorter terms. The national debt has grown by over $7.09 trillion since Biden took office in 2021, largely driven by COVID-19 relief measures.
As of June 2024, the U.S. national debt has passed $34.63 trillion. The United States has the highest national debt in the world by amount. However, Japan has the highest national debt in terms of gross domestic product—Japan’s national debt makes up 258.2% of its GDP. The national debt increased by nearly 40 times under Abraham Lincoln from 1861 to 1865—the largest multiple of increase in U.S. history.
The national debt increased by nearly 40 times under Abraham Lincoln from 1861 to 1865—the largest multiple of increase in U.S. history.

Content:
Nine days later, he tweeted, “Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration.” · That’s not how it played out. When Trump took office in January 2017, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting that federal budget deficits would be 2% to 3% of our gross domestic product during Trump’s term. Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019.
One of President Donald Trump’s lesser known but profoundly damaging legacies will be the explosive rise in the national debt that occurred on his watch. The financial burden that he’s inflicted on our government will wreak havoc for decades, saddling our kids and grandkids with debt. The national debt has risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s time in office. That’s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
As of Dec. 31, 2020, the national debt had jumped to $27.75 trillion, up 39% from $19.95 trillion when Trump was sworn in. The government ended its 2020 fiscal year with the portion of the national debt owed to investors, the metric favored by the CBO, at around 100% of GDP.
Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019. There were multiple culprits. Trump’s tax cuts, especially the sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, took a big bite out of federal revenue. The CBO estimated in 2018 that the tax cut would increase deficits by about $1.9 trillion over 11 years. Meanwhile, Trump’s claim that increased revenue from the tariffs would help eliminate (or at least reduce) our national debt hasn’t panned out.

Title: PolitiFact | Obama has added more to national debt than the previous 43 presidents combined, chain e-mail states
Content:
Says President Barack Obama "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt in his first term, more than the $6.3 trillion added by the previous 43 presidents combined. ... UPDATE: A more recent version of a similar claim is available here. When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined. Well, at least that’s according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years.
On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words "Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!" The amount listed below the photo is "$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS." A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim. The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet.
The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet. First, let’s explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt. The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion. So, under Obama’s watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent. By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama’s administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office.

During Donald Trump’s whole presidency, the U.S. national debt increased by $8.18 trillion, a percentage increase of 40.43%. This is less than Barack Obama (69.98%) and George W. Bush (105.8%). However, Donald Trump was in office for only 4 years compared to 8 years for both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. To tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, national debt was increased by a further 18.01% totaling $4.25 trillion in additional debt from March 2020 to Jan 2021.
President Obama holds the title for growing the national debt the most dollar-wise. In total, debt levels increased by $8.34 trillion (70%), from $11.9 trillion in 2009 to $20.2 trillion in 2017. This makes him the President with the eleventh largest increase in National Debt in Presidential history.
Each President took steps to stave off the recession’s effects that had a tremendous effect on the debt. George W. Bush’s bank bailout was initiated to keep financial institutions from collapsing, resulting in deficits exceeding $1 trillion. Barack Obama’s stimulus package (The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or ARRA) combined a $212 billion tax cut, a $296 billion expansion of Medicaid and unemployment benefits, and $279 billion in infrastructure spending to assist Americans still reeling from the recession’s effects on their financial well-being.
In total, debt levels increased by $8.34 trillion (70%), from $11.9 trillion in 2009 to $20.2 trillion in 2017. This makes him the President with the eleventh largest increase in National Debt in Presidential history. Obama continued to fight the Great Recession of 2008 with an $800+ billion economic stimulus package.

Title: False claim Trump increased debt more than any president | Fact check
Content:
Using Treasury Department data, the total public debt, which includes intragovernmental holdings and public debt, increased by approximately $7.8 trillion from the start of Trump’s presidency on Jan. 20, 2017, to when he left office on Jan. 19, 2021. Under Obama, however, the public debt increased by about $9.3 trillion from when he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009, to when he left office on Jan. 19, 2017.
At the end of fiscal year 2016 − three months before Trump took office − the debt was about $19.5 trillion, according to historical fiscal year debt data from the Office of Management and Budget. That number increased to about $26.9 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2020 three months before Trump left office, marking a $7.4 trillion increase. However, at the end of fiscal year 2008 before Obama took office, the debt was about $10 trillion and increased to about $19.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2016 before Obama left office, netting approximately a $9.5 trillion increase, according to the data.
However, at the end of fiscal year 2008 before Obama took office, the debt was about $10 trillion and increased to about $19.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2016 before Obama left office, netting approximately a $9.5 trillion increase, according to the data. There are caveats to these comparisons: Trump was only in office for four years while Obama was in office for eight years. The data for the federal fiscal year overlaps. And in both cases, the debt is measured using the nominal amount added each year, so it doesn't account for inflation.

Summary of the INFORMATION:

The provided information discusses the national debt of the United States and its growth under various presidents. Here's a summary of each piece of information:

Information 1: This article provides an overview of the national debt, stating that it has grown by over $7.09 trillion since Biden took office in 2021, largely driven by COVID-19 relief measures. It also mentions that the national debt increased by nearly 40 times under Abraham Lincoln and that Franklin D. Roosevelt contributed to the largest percent increase in national debt.

Information 2: This article focuses on the national debt during Donald Trump's presidency, stating that it rose by almost $7.8 trillion during his term. It also mentions that Trump's tax cuts and tariffs did not help reduce the national debt as he had claimed.

Information 3: This article fact-checks a claim that Obama added more to the national debt than the previous 43 presidents combined. It concludes that the claim is largely inaccurate, as Obama's administration was on track to add nearly $6.5 trillion to the national debt by October 2013, but had not added that much debt yet.

Information 4: This article provides a chart and data on the national debt by president, stating that Donald Trump's presidency saw a 40.43% increase in the national debt, while Barack Obama's presidency saw a 69.98% increase. It also mentions that Obama holds the title for growing the national debt the most dollar-wise.

Information 5: This article fact-checks a claim that Trump increased the debt more than any president, concluding that it is false. According to Treasury Department data, the public debt increased by approximately $7.8 trillion under Trump, while it increased by about $9.3 trillion under Obama.

Evidence to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM>:

The <CLAIM> states that the debt is "nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office." Based on the provided information, we can see that the national debt increased significantly during Obama's presidency.

According to Information 5, the public debt increased by approximately $9.3 trillion under Obama, from about $10 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008 to about $19.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2016. This means that the debt increased by more than $9 trillion during Obama's presidency, which is significantly more than the $6 trillion claimed.

Therefore, based on the available information, the <CLAIM> is FALSE. The national debt increased by more than $9 trillion during Obama's presidency, not nearly $6 trillion.

In 2012, Morrisey ran for Attorney General of West Virginia against Darrell McGraw, a five-term incumbent. He defeated McGraw and was sworn in on January 14, 2013, making him the first Republican state Attorney General to serve in West Virginia since 1933. Morrisey sued the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to release its data on opioid sales, and about the sales quota system that it uses to regulate opioid manufacturers, the first ever such lawsuit in West Virginia history.

Summary of INFORMATION:

The provided information consists of five sources that discuss Patrick Morrisey's background, political career, and stance on abortion.

Information 1 (Ballotpedia) provides a brief biography of Morrisey, including his education, work experience, and political career. It mentions that he ran for Congress in 2000 and lost in the Republican primary in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.

Information 2 (PolitiFact) investigates a claim made by Evan Jenkins that Morrisey supported abortion rights during his 2000 congressional campaign in New Jersey. The article does not provide a clear answer to the claim.

Information 3 (Wikipedia) provides more details about Morrisey's life and career. It mentions that he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey's 7th congressional district in 2000, receiving 9% of the vote in the Republican primary. The article also states that Morrisey was opposed to abortion with exceptions during his 2000 campaign.

Information 4 (news article) reports on Morrisey's bid for the Republican nomination for West Virginia governor. It mentions his background, including his birth in Brooklyn and upbringing in New Jersey.

Information 5 (Morrisey's campaign website) highlights Morrisey's achievements as Attorney General of West Virginia, including his pro-life stance and defense of the state's pro-life laws.

Evidence to judge the correctness of the <CLAIM>:

Based on the provided information, it appears that the <CLAIM> made by Evan Jenkins is TRUE. Information 3 (Wikipedia) states that during his 2000 congressional campaign in New Jersey, Morrisey was opposed to abortion with exceptions, which suggests that he held a more liberal stance on abortion at the time. This is consistent with Jenkins' claim that Morrisey "ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice."

While Morrisey's current campaign website (Information 5) emphasizes his pro-life stance, it does not contradict the fact that he may have held a different view in the past. Information 3 (Wikipedia) also notes that Morrisey has hardened his position on abortion since his first run for Congress in 2000.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to classify the <CLAIM> as TRUE.

All of the four gentrifying communities have gained residents with post-secondary education, although the percentage is still lower than the county’s average of 31%. With 25%, Third Ward was the community with the highest share of residents with high educational attainment among the four gentrifying communities.
The Kinder Institute’s “Re-Taking Stock” report showed how gentrifying communities in Harris County and Houston have evolved over the past 20 years. Gentrification has impacted many communities across the county, and some of the impacts are seen in changes in demographic characteristics and housing development patterns.
Of the neighborhoods that are identified as experiencing gentrification, four are historically Black communities—Fifth Ward and Third Ward, located inside I-610, and Independence Heights and Sunnyside, which fall between I-610 and Beltway 8.

Title: Texas's 18th congressional district - Wikipedia
Content:
Since the district was moved to Houston in 1972, it has voted for a Democrat in every presidential election. The district gave George McGovern 69% in 1972 and Walter Mondale 72% in 1984. In the TV series The West Wing, Texas's 18th congressional district was represented by fictional Democratic presidential candidate Matt Santos.

**Summary of INFORMATION:**

The provided information revolves around the demographics of Houston's 18th congressional district and the issue of gentrification in historically black neighborhoods in Houston.

Information 1 and 2 are identical and report on a statement made by John Faulk, a Republican challenging U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, that Houston's 18th congressional district has been "gentrified" and is home to "more Anglos than African Americans." Faulk cited the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2008, which shows that about 42% of the district's residents were white and 38% were black.

Information 3 discusses the gentrification of Houston's Third Ward, a historically black neighborhood, and the concerns about its impact on the community's African American culture.

Information 4 provides data on the demographic shifts in Houston's historic black neighborhoods, including the Third Ward, due to gentrification. It notes that the Hispanic/Latino population is growing in these areas and has surpassed the Black/African American population in some neighborhoods.

Information 5 is about Texas's 18th congressional district, which has consistently voted for Democrats in presidential elections.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM:**

Based on the available information, the CLAIM made by John Faulk on June 12, 2010, that Houston's 18th congressional district has been "gentrified" and is home to "more Anglos than African Americans" can be classified as **TRUE**.

The evidence supporting this classification comes from Information 1 and 2, which cite the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2008, showing that about 42% of the district's residents were white and 38% were black. This data suggests that, at the time of Faulk's statement, the district did have more Anglos (white residents) than African Americans.

Additionally, Information 4 provides context on the gentrification of historically black neighborhoods in Houston, including the Third Ward, which is part of the 18th congressional district. This gentrification has led to demographic shifts, with the Hispanic/Latino population growing in these areas.

While the CLAIM is supported by the available information, it is essential to note that demographics can change over time, and the situation may have evolved since Faulk's statement in 2010.

Content:
By Florida law, campaigns, committees, and electioneering communications organizations are required to disclose detailed financial records of campaign contributions and expenditures. Chapter 106, Florida Statutes, regulates campaign financing for all candidates, including judicial candidates, political committees, electioneering communications organizations, affiliated party committees, and political parties. It does not regulate campaign financing for candidates for federal office. The laws governing campaign finance reporting and campaign financing limitations are complex.
Note: A county, a municipality, or any other local governmental entity is expressly preempted from imposing contribution limits different from state law and any limitations on expenditures for electioneering communications or independent expenditures. See the specific language in section 1 of chapter 2021-16, Laws of Florida, which recently amended Section 106.08(1), Florida Statutes.
Except for political parties or affiliated party committees, no person or political committee may make contributions in excess of: $3,000 to a candidate for statewide office or for retention as a justice of the Supreme Court or to a political committee that is the sponsor of or is in opposition to a constitutional amendment proposed by initiative. However, the limitation on contributions to such political committees no longer applies once the Secretary of State has issued a certificate of ballot position and a designating number for the proposed amendment that the political committee is sponsoring or opposing.
In-kind contributions are subject to the same contribution limitations as money. An in-kind contribution is anything of value except money made for the purpose of influencing the results of an election. (Sections 106.011 and 106.055, F.S.; Division of Elections Opinions 04-06 and 09-08.)

The rules governing federal election campaigns and contributions have evolved over the past generation as result of a number of Supreme Court decisions. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, the court held that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited.
In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, the court held that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information relates to campaign finance laws and regulations in Florida and at the federal level. Here's a summary of each piece of information:

1. **Campaign Finance - Division of Elections - Florida Department of State**: This information outlines Florida's campaign finance laws, including the requirement for campaigns to disclose detailed financial records. It also mentions contribution limits, which vary depending on the office being sought, and notes that in-kind contributions are subject to the same limits as monetary contributions.
2. **Campaign finance requirements in Florida - Ballotpedia**: This information provides a table detailing contribution limits in Florida as of May 2015. It also mentions the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) role in disclosing campaign finance information and enforcing limits.
3. **Chapter 106 Section 08 - 2018 Florida Statutes - The Florida Senate**: This information outlines specific aspects of Florida's campaign finance laws, including what constitutes a contribution and how certain items, like polling services and campaign staff costs, are not considered contributions.
4. **The 2023 Florida Statutes (including Special Session C)**: Unfortunately, no description is provided for this page.
5. **FEC | Candidate | Contribution limits**: This information explains federal contribution limits for campaigns, including individual donations, political action committees (PACs), and party committees.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the provided information, it appears that Florida's campaign contribution limits are relatively low. According to Information 1, the limit for contributions to a candidate for statewide office or for retention as a justice of the Supreme Court is $3,000. This is a relatively low limit compared to other states.

While the claim that Florida has "the second-lowest (campaign) contribution limit in the entire country" is not directly supported by the provided information, it is possible that this is the case. However, without more comprehensive data on campaign contribution limits across all 50 states, it is difficult to verify this claim with absolute certainty.

**Classification of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **LIKELY TRUE**, but with some uncertainty due to the lack of comprehensive data on campaign contribution limits across all 50 states.

This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark.
In his first two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 line-item vetoes to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden. The only judicial limitation was Risser v. Klauser, which prohibited the "reduction veto", stating that "the constitution prohibits a write-in veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts." In 2009, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the "Vanna White veto".
The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.
H.R. 4890, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act, was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006, by a vote of 24–9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar version was included in the "Stop Over Spending Act of 2006", authored by Senator Judd Gregg, in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee, but the full Senate failed to approve it, thereby preventing the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act from becoming law.

This legislation would help the President and Congress work together to reduce our budget deficit by providing the President with the authority to single out wasteful spending items and narrow special-interest tax breaks included in legislation that he signs into law and send these specific items back to Congress for a timely vote.
This legislation would help the President and Congress work together to reduce our budget deficit by providing the President with the authority to single out wasteful spending items and narrow special-interest tax breaks included in legislation that he signs into law and send these specific items back to Congress for a timely vote. Unlike the line-item veto authority provided to President Clinton in 1996, H.R. 4890 is constitutional because it requires an up-or-down vote in both chambers of Congress under an expedited process in order to effectuate the President's proposed rescissions.
Less than two months after the Supreme Court's decision in Raines, President Clinton exercised his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel ``one item of new direct spending'' in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which had the effect of reducing the State of New York's federal Medicaid subsidies by almost $1 billion. I represented the City of New York and certain healthcare associations and providers, which lost many millions of dollars in federal matching funds as a direct result of the President's cancellation, in a suit challenging the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 provided that the President may ``cancel in whole'' any (1) ``dollar amount of discretionary budget authority,'' (2) ``item of new direct spending,'' or (3) ``limited tax benefit'' by sending Congress a ``special message'' within five days after signing a bill containing the item. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691(a). Cancellation took effect when Congress received the special message. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691b(a). The Act defined ``cancel'' as ``to rescind'' (with respect to any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority) and to ``prevent . . . from having legal force or effect'' (with respect to items of new direct spending or limited tax benefits).

President George W. Bush has asked Congress to enact the "Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006." This proposal, sponsored in the Senate by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and in the House by Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI), bypasses the constitutional concerns that led the Supreme Court to rule the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 unconstitutional just one year after President Bill Clinton used it to strike $600 million in spending.
A good step, but not one that will solve spending on its own.
Rescission is the process whereby the president sends legislation to Congress to cancel budget authority that was previously enacted but not yet spent. Like any legislation, rescission bills must be passed by the House and Senate and then signed by the president. Currently, however, Congress can kill a rescission request by voting it down or simply ignoring it. The President's Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006 improves on existing rescission authority in several ways: The president could "veto" entitlement changes and special tax breaks, as well as all discretionary appropriations;

Title: Senate “Line-Item Veto” Proposal Invites Abuse by Executive Branch | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Content:
The President’s line-item veto authority with respect to spending items wouldnot be limited to special interest earmarks in appropriations bills; the President could propose the cancellation of entire programs and broad program provisions that would benefit millions of Americans and did not single out any special interest. The Budget Committee measure adopts this very restrictive approach with respect to new tax breaks despite the finding by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, the Government Accountability Office, and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that hundreds of billions of dollars a year of tax breaks contained in the tax code are analogous to entitlement programs and are properly thought of as “tax expenditures” or “tax entitlements.”[6]
Acting Congressional Budget Office director Donald Marron commented on this aspect of the proposal in recent testimony on the Administration’s line-item veto proposal, which would allow a 180-day withholding period. Marron noted that the withholding of funds “would not end upon the Congress’s rejection of the rescission proposals…,” giving the President the “power to unilaterally defer spending for six months, thereby effectively canceling some budget authority and some programs altogether (for which the funding would lapse at the end of the fiscal year)…” The risk that Marron cited would be reduced by the provision in the Senate legislation that allows funds to be withheld for 45 days rather than 180, but the risk surely would not be eliminated.
As explained in the body of this analysis, most non-partisan experts who have examined the line-item-veto have concluded it is likely to do little to improve fiscal discipline or reduce deficits. Its principal effect is likely to be a significant enhancement in the President’s leverage in dealing with Congress, and not only in budgetary matters. The expansion of Presidential authority under the Senate Budget Committee’s line-item veto measure raises serious concerns.
Tax expenditures are similar to those direct spending programs that are available as entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the programs.” See Joint Committee on Taxation, “Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2005-2009,” January 12, 2005, p. 2. This equivalence is why former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has referred to these tax breaks as “tax entitlements.” ...

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information relates to the concept of a line-item veto in the United States, which allows the President or a governor to cancel specific provisions within a bill without vetoing the entire bill. Here's a summary of each piece of information:

1. The Wikipedia article discusses the history of line-item veto attempts in the United States, including the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006, which was approved by the House Budget Committee but failed to pass the full Senate. It also mentions the use of line-item vetoes by governors, such as Tommy Thompson, and the limitations imposed by the courts.
2. This information is a prepared statement by Paul Ryan, Chairman of the House Budget Committee, in support of the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006. Ryan argues that the act would help reduce the budget deficit by allowing the President to single out wasteful spending items and send them back to Congress for a timely vote.
3. The Heritage Foundation article discusses President George W. Bush's proposal for a line-item veto, which would allow the President to cancel specific spending items or tax breaks. The article suggests that this proposal could help control spending, but notes that it is not a solution on its own.
4. This information is about the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The act allowed the President to cancel specific spending items or tax breaks, but was later ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
5. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities article critiques the Senate's line-item veto proposal, arguing that it could be abused by the Executive Branch and would not effectively reduce deficits.

**Analysis of the CLAIM**

The claim made by Chris Christie on July 9, 2012, states that he used his line-item veto authority to veto $360 million in special interest spending, resulting in a smaller budget than his predecessor's budgets for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.

Based on the provided information, it appears that Christie's claim is plausible. The information suggests that governors have used line-item vetoes to cancel specific spending items, and Christie's claim is consistent with this concept. However, without more specific information about Christie's actions as governor, it is difficult to verify the exact details of his claim.

To classify the claim more accurately, additional evidence would be needed to confirm the following:

1. Did Chris Christie, as governor, have the authority to use a line-item veto?
2. Did he exercise this authority to veto $360 million in special interest spending?
3. Is the resulting budget smaller than his predecessor's budgets for fiscal years 2008 and 2009?

Without this additional evidence, the claim cannot be definitively classified as TRUE or FALSE.

Texas has experienced significant population growth in recent years, contributing to an overall increase in the number of registered voters. The population grew by 4% from January 2020 to January 2023, the majority of which was driven by migration, not new births. That growth did not necessarily translate into more early voters, though. Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University who has studied voting behavior, said this may be because candidates don’t usually target new residents, whose voter history may be unknown to them.
Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University who has studied voting behavior, said this may be because candidates don’t usually target new residents, whose voter history may be unknown to them. “What really motivates people to vote is someone asking them to vote,” Stein said. “Candidates may not want to turn out those registered voters because they don't know much about them — they don't know where they came from, they don't know how they voted, we don't have party registration.”
Turnout in the 216 mostly rural counties that historically vote strongly Republican had the smallest dip in participation rates, about 4.1 percentage points. “I think there is less enthusiasm for the big matchup in 2024,” which is almost certain to be between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “We’ve been there, done that, and I think a lot of voters are kind of sitting on the sidelines until things change.”
This year’s drop in turnout came despite an uptick in the overall number of registered voters in Texas since 2020. Democratic turnout accounted for the entirety of the decline — Republican participation increased slightly compared to 2020 but not by not enough to counter the sharp decrease in votes cast in the Democratic primary.

Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, southern white voters began to align with the Republican Party, a movement accelerated after the next year, when Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, providing for federal enforcement of minorities' constitutional right to vote. Voter registration and turnout increased among blacks and Latinos in Texas and other states.
The Democrats were pro-slavery pre-Civil War, as Abraham Lincoln was a Republican in the North. Most Republicans were Abolitionists. In the mid-20th century 1952 and 1956 elections, the state voters joined the landslide for Dwight D. Eisenhower. (Texas did not vote in 1864 and 1868 due to the Civil War and Reconstruction).
In the post-Reconstruction era, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Republican Party became non-competitive in the South, due to Democrat-dominated legislatures' disenfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites and Latinos. In Texas, the Democrat-dominated legislature excluded them through passage of a poll tax and white primary. Voter turnout in Texas declined dramatically following these disenfranchisement measures, and Southern voting turnout was far below the national average.
But beginning in the early 20th century, voter turnout was dramatically reduced by the state legislature's disenfranchisement of most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. From 1848 until Dwight D. Eisenhower's victory in 1952, Texas voted for the Democratic candidate for president in every election except 1928, when it did not support Catholic Al Smith. The Democrats were pro-slavery pre-Civil War, as Abraham Lincoln was a Republican in the North.
In the mid-20th century 1952 and 1956 elections, the state voters joined the landslide for Dwight D. Eisenhower. (Texas did not vote in 1864 and 1868 due to the Civil War and Reconstruction).

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to voter registration, political affiliations, and voting behavior in Texas.

Information 1 and 5 are identical, citing a claim by Robert Koons, a philosophy professor, that in the history department at the University of Texas, only one out of 50 registered voters is a Republican.

Information 2, published in 2024, discusses the voting behavior in Texas, stating that despite an increase in registered voters, Democratic turnout has declined, while Republican participation has increased slightly.

Information 3, from Wikipedia, provides a historical context of the political landscape in Texas, explaining how the state's voting patterns have shifted over time, particularly with regards to the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act.

Information 4 appears to be a table or dataset of turnout and voter registration figures in Texas from 1970 to the present, but the content is not provided.

**Evidence to judge the correctness of the CLAIM**

Based on the available information, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the CLAIM with absolute certainty. However, we can analyze the evidence and make an informed judgment.

The CLAIM is based on a statement by Robert Koons, who referred to a breakdown of voter registrations by department at the University of Texas, completed by a student working with Professor Joseph Horn in psychology. However, the publication date of this breakdown is not specified, and it is unclear whether the data is still relevant.

Information 2 and 3 provide a broader context of voting behavior in Texas, suggesting that the state has a complex political landscape with shifting voting patterns over time. While these pieces of information do not directly support or refute the CLAIM, they do indicate that the political affiliations of voters in Texas can be nuanced and subject to change.

In the absence of more recent and specific data on the political affiliations of registered voters in the history department at the University of Texas, it is difficult to classify the CLAIM as TRUE or FALSE with certainty. However, based on the available information, it is possible that the CLAIM may be an outdated or anecdotal observation that may not reflect the current political landscape of the department.

**Classification**

Given the limitations of the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as UNVERIFIED. While the CLAIM may have been accurate at the time it was made, there is insufficient evidence to confirm its accuracy today.

Restricting access to financial aid would turn back progress made by AACTE and other organizations and institutions to build an educator workforce that is culturally and racially representative of the communities in which they serve. Finally, given the current decline in teacher preparation program enrollment seen across the country and the continued increase in the cost of higher education, the connection of students’ financial aid to a misguided rating system would likely exacerbate problems, not solve them.
The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and its 800 member institutions are committed to preparing effective teachers — and to improving programs that fall short of that goal — but requiring states to rate programs and institute other costly changes is counterproductive.
Teacher preparation programs have significant improvements under way addressing many of the concerns to which these regulations appear to be responding. Since 2009, the federal government has funded innovation and reform through Teacher Quality Partnership grants, which have been awarded to more than 50 collaborations of high-need school districts and educator preparation programs working to ensure fully prepared teachers are in high-need schools.

This restriction is imposed by §§ 7 and 20.
This restriction is imposed by §§ 7 and 20. A district that wishes to be able to pay its teachers extra to perform services in addition to teaching, such as coaching, should include a provision in the teachers’ collective bargaining agreement providing a set amount of extra pay for such services, to be included in regular paychecks. This solves the problem, because then the teachers only have a financial interest in one contract, that is, their primary employment, which is governed by the collective bargaining agreement.

**Summary of INFORMATION**

The provided information consists of five pieces of content related to teacher contracts, negotiations, and regulations. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. A fact-checking article from 2021 debunks a fake contract from 1923 that restricts female teachers' morality and behavior.
2. An article from 2021 explains the process of negotiating teachers' contracts in California, highlighting the "sunshine" clause that requires public disclosure of proposals and financial impacts.
3. A webpage (no publication date) describes a "Classroom Contract" as a collaborative framework for behavior expectations in the classroom, developed by students and teachers.
4. An article from 2021 expresses concerns about proposed federal regulations for teacher preparation programs, which could restrict access to financial aid and exacerbate problems in the education system.
5. A webpage (no publication date) explains the conflict of interest law for public school teachers in Massachusetts, restricting them from having a second paid position with their school district or charter school.

**Evaluation of the CLAIM**

The CLAIM, made by Portland Public Schools in 2013, states that a proposed teacher contract "would layer on more restrictive rules." Based on the provided information, we can evaluate the CLAIM as follows:

* Information 2 provides context on the negotiation process and the "sunshine" clause, which ensures transparency in contract proposals. This suggests that the negotiation process is designed to be open and collaborative, rather than restrictive.
* Information 4 expresses concerns about proposed federal regulations that could restrict access to financial aid, but this is a separate issue from teacher contracts.
* Information 5 explains the conflict of interest law for public school teachers in Massachusetts, which restricts them from having a second paid position. While this law imposes restrictions, it is not directly related to the CLAIM about a proposed teacher contract.

There is no direct evidence in the provided information to support or refute the CLAIM that the proposed teacher contract would layer on more restrictive rules. The CLAIM appears to be a specific statement about a particular contract proposal, and without more information about that proposal, it is difficult to evaluate its accuracy.

**Classification**

Based on the available information, I would classify the CLAIM as **UNVERIFIED**. While the CLAIM makes a specific statement about a proposed teacher contract, there is not enough evidence in the provided information to confirm or deny its accuracy.
