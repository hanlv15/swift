Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Evidence for the effectiveness of masking on SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level has accumulated, but the additional benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. In this observational study of matched cohorts from 412 US counties between March 21 and October 20, 2020, we estimated the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence.
Subsequently, many states and counties established their own mandates of who should wear masks and when, and how public masking would be enforced. Between April and September 2020, the timing of these masking mandates was highly variable throughout the country. By the fall of 2020, guidance from local health authorities converged so that universal masking in public locations, alongside recommendations for social distancing, had become the norm in most regions. The evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level has been strong1–4 for viruses that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, spread principally through close contact with an infected person.5–9 However, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates beyond public health guidance has been less certain.

Title: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...
Content:
We considered the impact of mandates for mask use targeted only to employees in some work settings, as opposed to communitywide mandates. This evidence is critical, as states and countries worldwide begin to shift to “reopening” their economies and as foot traffic increases. Mandating the public use of masks has become a socially and politically contentious issue, with multiple protests and even acts of violence directed against masked employees and those asking customers to wear face masks.17 Face cover recommendations and mandates are part of the current set of measures, following earlier social distancing measures such as school and nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, and shelter-in-place orders being considered by states and local governments, especially as regions of the country reopen.
The state orders strongly discourage the use of any medical or surgical masks and N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders. The orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).
Exhibit 2 plots the event study estimates of changes in county-level daily COVID-19 growth rates with the employee-only face cover mandates and their 95 percent confidence intervals. All pre- and postmandate estimates were small and insignificant. Overall, these results indicate no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Exhibit 2 Event study estimates of effects of states mandating only employee use of face masks during working time on daily county-level growth rate of COVID-19 cases
Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable. These sixteen jurisdictions also have specific mandates requiring employees in certain professions to wear masks at all times while working.

The country is probably never going to come to a consensus on masks. They have become yet another source of political polarization.

Fortunately, the scientific evidence points to a reasonable compromise. Because masks work and mandates often don’t, people can make their own decisions. Anybody who wants to wear a snug, high-quality mask can do so and will be less likely to contract Covid. If anything, that approach — one-way masking — is consistent with what hospitals have long done, as Doron, the Tufts epidemiologist, points out.
Mask mandates in schools also seem to have done little to reduce the spread. Hong Kong, despite almost universal mask-wearing, recently endured one of the world’s worst Covid outbreaks. Advocates of mandates sometimes argue that they do have a big effect even if it is not evident in populationwide data, because of how many other factors are at play.
In response, many people are understandably asking what the country can do to minimize the virus’s toll in the weeks ahead. ... So far, a lot of discussion has focused on mask mandates. Schools in Philadelphia; Providence, R.I.; Berkeley, Calif.; and Brookline, Mass., have reimposed theirs, as have several colleges. Elsewhere, some people are frustrated that officials, like New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, have not done so.

Counties with less than 40,000 individuals were excluded because smaller counties tended not to have enough daily infections to analyze. Data were gathered utilizing the US Census Bureau’s 2019 population estimates [15]. Demographic data were also found utilizing the US Census Bureau’s data [16]. The demographic information recorded includes the total estimated population and the average age of the test and control counties.
For reference, the population of HKSAR is approximately 7.45 million people [8]. In another study, there was no risk of transmission from two infected hairstylists and nearly 139 clients, of which the mean age was 52 years old (age range, 21–93 years), and this was attributed to the use of masks [9]. Furthermore, evaluation of 382 sailors (interquartile age range, 24–35 years) on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US navy ship, found that those who took extra precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as mask-wearing, had a 70.0% reduction in transmission when compared to those who did not wear masks [10]. Another study looking at 15 US states (plus Washington, D.C.) with mandated mask requirements found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate [11].

Based on the information provided, the claim that "We know mask mandates work" is not entirely accurate. While there is evidence that masking at the individual level can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. Information 1 and Information 3 both found no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Information 4 also states that mask mandates often don't work. However, Information 5 found that counties with mask mandates had a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mandate. Overall, while masking can be effective, the effectiveness of mask mandates is still a matter of debate.

Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington’s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk. Cloth masks are “plenty big to allow for the free flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while still small enough to capture some of the larger respiratory droplets that could contain COVID-19,” Baker said in an email.
While it is true that some N95 masks have exhale valves and do not reduce virus spread very effectively, those recommended for frontline healthcare workers are unvented and are more effective at preventing spread. Baker agreed. “Masks (N95 or other) that have a one way valve, do allow for unfiltered air to be exhaled. For this reason, wearing this mask doesn't protect the people around you. Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for COVID-19.”
Social media posts shared thousands of times in the United States contain multiple false or misleading claims about face masks used to stop the spread of COVID-19, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks “do not filter anything” and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air.

TIME . How “America’s frontline doctors” sold access to bogus COVID-19 treatments—and left patients in the lurch.
In this mixed-methods study of high-use social media platforms, physicians from across the US and representing a range of medical specialties were found to propagate COVID-19 misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and masks on large social media and other online platforms and that many had a wide reach based on number of followers.
Outcome measures included categories of COVID-19 misinformation propagated, the number and traits of physicians engaged in misinformation propagation, and the type of online media channels used to propagate misinformation and potential reach. The propagation of COVID-19 misinformation was attributed to 52 physicians in 28 different specialties across all regions of the country. General misinformation categories included vaccines, medication, masks, and other (ie, conspiracy theories).
Forty-two physicians (80.8%) posted vaccine misinformation, 40 (76.9%) propagated information in more than 1 category, and 20 (38.5%) posted misinformation on 5 or more platforms. Major themes identified included (1) disputing vaccine safety and effectiveness, (2) promoting medical treatments lacking scientific evidence and/or US Food and Drug Administration approval, (3) disputing mask-wearing effectiveness, and (4) other (unsubstantiated claims, eg, virus origin, government lies, and other conspiracy theories).

However, the claim does not specify the type of misinformation being spread. Information 1, published on 2020-07-28, provides specific examples of false claims about face masks, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks filter nothing and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air. Dr. Marissa Baker from the University of Washington's Industrial Hygiene program confirmed that masks, including cloth and N95 masks, should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk and are effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the claim is partially true, but specific examples of misinformation should be provided to support the claim fully.

A cache of internal emails reveals city officials believed chances were “low” that the festivities would help spread the virus, a prediction that proved tragically off base.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published in 2020, states that Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards mentioned there was no suggestion from any doctor, scientist, or political figure to cancel Mardi Gras due to the coronavirus threat. At the time, there were few coronavirus cases in the United States and no community spread. The information also explains that Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans occurred in January and ended on February 25, 2020.

Information 4, published on March 27, 2020, states that New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell blamed President Trump for her decision not to cancel Mardi Gras, which led to a spike in COVID-19 cases in Louisiana.

Information 5, published on April 13, 2020, reveals that internal emails showed city officials believed the chances were low that Mardi Gras festivities would help spread the virus.

The other two pieces of information, Information 2 and 3, are not relevant to the claim, as they discuss individuals spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 and 2022.

Claim Verification:

The claim, made on April 5, 2020, states that no doctor, scientist, or political figure suggested canceling Mardi Gras due to the coronavirus threat. This claim is consistent with Information 1, which was published earlier, on April 5, 2020. The information provided by the other sources supports the claim, as it shows that Governor John Bel Edwards and Mayor LaToya Cantrell did not cancel Mardi Gras due to the lack of suggestions from experts and political figures.

Therefore, the claim is considered TRUE based on the available information and the sequential relationship between the date of publication of the claim and the date of publication of the information.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax and a warning about this risk is included in its product information. These reports are very rare, and the events reported are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. People should come forward for their second and booster vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise · It is important that anyone who experiences new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart seeks medical attention.
Up to 23 August 2022, 53 million people received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 50 million received a second dose and 40 million received a third or booster dose. Safety monitoring throughout the deployment showed that the most common adverse reactions for all the COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting ‘reactogenicity’-type events such as fever, fatigue and injection site pain.
The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected adverse incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients, users, or carers). The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.
Everyone aged 5 years and over is eligible to receive a first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. People aged 16 years and over, and some children aged 12 to 15, are also eligible to receive a booster dose. People aged 5 years and over who had a severely weakened immune system when they had their first 2 doses, will be offered a third dose before any booster doses.

Content:
The transfer of convalescent plasma is an old concept, having been used since at least 1918 when it was employed to fight the Spanish flu pandemic.12 More recently, convalescent plasma was used with some reported success during the 2003 SARS pandemic,13,14 the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic,15 and the 2015 Ebola outbreak in Africa.16 Several small observational studies published during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest convalescent plasma is part of an effective treatment strategy for patients with severe disease.17, 18, 19, 20 The first report describing administration of convalescent plasma to five patients early in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was recently published.18 Five critically ill patients received two, same-day infusions from five recovered healthy donors.
Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for >100 years. Patients (n = 25) with severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28, 2020, to April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma, obtained from donors with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who had recovered.
In four of the five patients, inflammatory biomarkers decreased and Alveolar–arterial (A/a) gradient improved, and all patients had improvement in pulmonary lesions on the basis of computed tomography scan.18 A second study by Duan et al17 reported improved clinical outcomes in 10 patients who received a single transfusion of convalescent plasma, with no adverse events reported. Two additional small case studies of five and six patients have since been published with similar findings.19,20 A more recent study by Zeng et al21 suggested that administration of convalescent plasma late in the disease course was ineffective for mortality reduction.
The patient placed on ECMO received a second dose of convalescent plasma confirmed to have high IgG titer before transfusion. The patient was eventually extubated and weaned off ECMO. Regardless, at this time, no clear correlation between ELISA IgG titer and patient outcomes can be established in this small patient cohort.

This small sample size limits our ability to draw robust conclusions about the level of neutralizing antibodies necessary to improve convalescent plasma-recipient outcomes. During this time frame, all available MSH-ELISA testing capacity was prioritized for the screening of potential convalescent plasma donors; thus, we were not able to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers before or after transfusion in convalescent plasma recipients.
Importantly, the number of mechanically ventilated convalescent plasma recipients in our study is small, and larger randomized trials are still needed to address uncertainties about the effect of convalescent plasma and to define more clearly the patient populations in whom convalescent plasma may have benefit.
We did not observe a correlation between donor serum neutralizing titers and convalescent plasma-recipient outcomes (Fig. 3c), with the caveats that, (1) all of our donors were prescreened to have relatively high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers before donation and, (2) the sample size is small.

The claim, published on April 14, 2020, states that small trials to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients seem to have had some degree of success. Information 1 supports this claim, as it describes a study conducted at Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28, 2020, to April 14, 2020, which showed promising results for critically ill COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma. However, more recent information (Information 5) published in 2023 discusses convalescent plasma therapy in general terms without referring to specific studies or results, making it difficult to assess the current state of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 based on the available information.

In conclusion, based on the information available up to April 14, 2020, the claim appears to be TRUE. Small trials to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients did seem to have had some degree of success, as described in Information 1. However, more recent information published in 2023 does not provide specific results or conclusions regarding the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.

Title: Reconcile the debate over protective effects of BCG vaccine against ...
Content:
In the 1970s, WHO launched massive immunization programs in developing countries, leading to substantial increase in BCG coverage among 1-year-olds: BCG coverage rate increased from 9% to 80% in African countries, and from 20% to 90% in European countries between 1980 and 201911. Though BCG vaccine was first developed as a prevention for tuberculosis, recent studies have found that BCG vaccine has nonspecific benefits in training the innate immunity through bestowing a type of immunological memory on innate cells12,13,14. This “trained innate immunity” has been shown to be protective against viral infections15,16. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is under debate17,18,19,20.
As targeted COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, researchers have been actively exploring the protective effects of existing vaccines, among which the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) has received much attention following observation of a coincident relationship between severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the level of BCG vaccination in one country8. The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in the 1930s and used to prevent tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the most prevalent diseases in developing countries9,10.
Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36.

Title: Study: TB Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of COVID-19
Content:
A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year.
The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.
While noting that no one believes BCG will be more effective than a specific vaccine for COVID-19, Arditi explained that it could be more quickly approved and made available, given that it has a strong safety profile demonstrated by many years of use. "It is a potentially important bridge that could offer some benefit until we have the most effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines made widely available," he said.
In fact, a number of randomized clinical trials have been launched to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Along with Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Cedars Sinai is a site for the U.S. arm of this ongoing trial, which is recruiting hundreds of healthcare workers.

Title: Frontiers | The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future ...
Content:
BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses.
In addition, since BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (17), it may help to reduce hospitalizations dure to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Here, we review some recent data that addresses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases.
Only ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will provide answers to whether BCG reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 through its cross-protective effects. The phase III randomized clinical trial ACTIVATE (NCT03296423) confirmed that recent vaccination with BCG in elderly (>65 years) protects against new infections.
The study concluded that BCG vaccination is safe, as recently reported by the same group (17), and can protect the elderly against infections. The study also suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, although larger and specific studies are needed to assess BCG protection against COVID-19.

Title: BCG Vaccine Prevents Tuberculosis in Young Children, but Not Adults ...
Content:
When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children. Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries. “The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,” he says.
Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed. “Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.
“Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology. “Our findings indicate that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children.
For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.

Information 1, published in an unspecified date, discusses the history and potential nonspecific benefits of the BCG vaccine. The vaccine, originally developed for tuberculosis prevention, has been shown to have adjuvant effects that can enhance innate immune responses and provide long-lasting protection via trained immunity. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is still under debate.

Information 2, published on 2020-11-28, is a retrospective, observational study that found people who received the BCG vaccination were less likely to report symptoms of COVID-19 and less likely to have antibodies against the infection in their blood. The BCG vaccine was developed more than 100 years ago to protect against tuberculosis.

Information 3, published on 2020-11-20, is a study by Cedars-Sinai that found a correlation between the BCG vaccine and reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19. The study raises the possibility that the vaccine may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.

Information 4, does not have a specific publication date, discusses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases. The study concludes that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections, and suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Information 5, also does not have a specific publication date, states that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children, but has a limited efficacy as a booster and new vaccines are needed.

The claim, published on 2020-04-20, states that recent news and media claims that the Tuberculosis vaccine- BCG may be effective against COVID-19. Based on the information provided, it is true that recent studies and news have reported a potential protective effect of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19, however, the evidence is not yet conclusive and ongoing randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Most vaccines need to be stored within 1 degree Fahrenheit of their ideal temperature. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures.
Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures. Moderna’s vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas Pfizer’s vaccine candidate requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typical restaurant freezers have a range of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and simply can’t reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. Specialized equipment is needed. Several major logistics companies, including UPS and DHL, are already investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management. UPS is adding freezer farms of 600 freezers capable of reaching minus 80 degrees Celsius near UPS air hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and the Netherlands.
This will depend on the refrigeration capacity of health care organizations and hospitals, staffing resources, the locations the vaccines will be given and many other factors, including the shelf life of the vaccine itself. Finally, there is the simple problem of how to expand shipping and storage capacity. Typical restaurant freezers have a range of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and simply can’t reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published on September 19, 2020, explains that an effective vaccine is the first step, but delivering hundreds of millions of doses that may need to be kept at arctic temperatures is another challenge. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Moderna's vaccine requiring -4 degrees Fahrenheit and Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Information 2, published on November 3, 2020, reiterates the temperature requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine candidates and adds that typical restaurant freezers cannot reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. It also explains that companies like UPS and DHL are investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management.

Information 3, with no publication date, is almost identical to Information 2.

Information 4, with no publication date, emphasizes the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling practices.

Information 5, with no publication date, explains the different temperature ranges for vaccine storage, including ultralow at -70 degrees Celsius, frozen at -20 degrees Celsius, and refrigerated between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It also mentions that not many facilities can handle -70 degrees Celsius, but large universities, some large hospitals, and pharmacy chain distribution centers may have the required storage.

Claim: The claim was published on September 17, 2020, and states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero.

Analysis: Given the information provided, it is clear that the claim was made before specific vaccine candidates' temperature requirements were publicly known. Information became available on September 19, 2020, that some leading COVID-19 vaccines needed to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the claim does not specify which vaccines need to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or not, as it lacks specificity. Nonetheless, considering the information about the temperature requirements for some COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is plausible that some vaccines need to be shipped at temperatures around -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed that “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” · What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country?

Governor Jay Inslee of Washington was the first to do so, issuing a COVID-19 emergency proclamation on February 29 ( here ).
According to the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization, “No federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions… If governors choose to disregard his call to reopen their states, their decisions will be final” ( here ).

Title: Can the Government Really Shut Down My Business and Make Me Stay Home?
Content:
Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.
That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people. He must do only those things which comply with the laws enacted by the legislature (as interpreted by judges). So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments.
So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments. Those statutes pre-authorized the executive branch (which the Governor heads) to take certain, specific actions when the state is facing an emergency.
In those instances, the State invoked more familiar provisions of the statutes governing declarations of emergency, including freeing up money earmarked for emergency use; calling on the national guard to help with the effects of the storm; and allowing the police to redirect traffic. But the Governor’s statutory powers during an emergency are broad, flexible, and include the ability to “make such orders.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published without a date, explains that state and local governments have the authority to force businesses to close and impose restrictions on individuals during emergencies, based on a Supreme Court case from 1905.

Information 2, published on May 12, 2020, states that governors have the authority to declare a state of emergency and manage it according to state laws. The National Governors Association explains that no federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions.

Information 3, without a publication date, explains the process of how a governor can issue executive orders during a state of emergency, and these orders must comply with the laws enacted by the legislature.

Information 4, published on July 20, 2020, discusses the impact of Washington State Governor Inslee's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses, with some business owners blaming the governor for their struggles.

Information 5, published on February 21, 2020, highlights the National Governors Association's role in connecting governors and sharing guidance on addressing COVID-19 challenges.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on December 27, 2020, states that governors in many states, including the author's own state, are closing down businesses again. Given the information presented, it is reasonable to assume that governors do have the authority to close businesses during a state of emergency, as explained in Information 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, Information 4 shows that some business owners in Washington State blame Governor Inslee for their struggles, indicating that businesses have been closed in that state.

Considering the timeline of the information, all sources point to the fact that governors can close businesses during a state of emergency, and some have done so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the claim is likely true, as governors do have the authority to close businesses in their states during emergencies.
