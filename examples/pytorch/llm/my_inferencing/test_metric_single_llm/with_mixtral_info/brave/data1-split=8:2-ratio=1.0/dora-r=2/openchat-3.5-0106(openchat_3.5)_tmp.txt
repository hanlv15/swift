Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Evidence for the effectiveness of masking on SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level has accumulated, but the additional benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. In this observational study of matched cohorts from 412 US counties between March 21 and October 20, 2020, we estimated the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence.
Subsequently, many states and counties established their own mandates of who should wear masks and when, and how public masking would be enforced. Between April and September 2020, the timing of these masking mandates was highly variable throughout the country. By the fall of 2020, guidance from local health authorities converged so that universal masking in public locations, alongside recommendations for social distancing, had become the norm in most regions. The evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level has been strong1–4 for viruses that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, spread principally through close contact with an infected person.5–9 However, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates beyond public health guidance has been less certain.

Title: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...
Content:
We considered the impact of mandates for mask use targeted only to employees in some work settings, as opposed to communitywide mandates. This evidence is critical, as states and countries worldwide begin to shift to “reopening” their economies and as foot traffic increases. Mandating the public use of masks has become a socially and politically contentious issue, with multiple protests and even acts of violence directed against masked employees and those asking customers to wear face masks.17 Face cover recommendations and mandates are part of the current set of measures, following earlier social distancing measures such as school and nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, and shelter-in-place orders being considered by states and local governments, especially as regions of the country reopen.
The state orders strongly discourage the use of any medical or surgical masks and N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders. The orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).
Exhibit 2 plots the event study estimates of changes in county-level daily COVID-19 growth rates with the employee-only face cover mandates and their 95 percent confidence intervals. All pre- and postmandate estimates were small and insignificant. Overall, these results indicate no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Exhibit 2 Event study estimates of effects of states mandating only employee use of face masks during working time on daily county-level growth rate of COVID-19 cases
Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable. These sixteen jurisdictions also have specific mandates requiring employees in certain professions to wear masks at all times while working.

The country is probably never going to come to a consensus on masks. They have become yet another source of political polarization.

Fortunately, the scientific evidence points to a reasonable compromise. Because masks work and mandates often don’t, people can make their own decisions. Anybody who wants to wear a snug, high-quality mask can do so and will be less likely to contract Covid. If anything, that approach — one-way masking — is consistent with what hospitals have long done, as Doron, the Tufts epidemiologist, points out.
Mask mandates in schools also seem to have done little to reduce the spread. Hong Kong, despite almost universal mask-wearing, recently endured one of the world’s worst Covid outbreaks. Advocates of mandates sometimes argue that they do have a big effect even if it is not evident in populationwide data, because of how many other factors are at play.
In response, many people are understandably asking what the country can do to minimize the virus’s toll in the weeks ahead. ... So far, a lot of discussion has focused on mask mandates. Schools in Philadelphia; Providence, R.I.; Berkeley, Calif.; and Brookline, Mass., have reimposed theirs, as have several colleges.

Counties with less than 40,000 individuals were excluded because smaller counties tended not to have enough daily infections to analyze.

The demographic information recorded includes the total estimated population and the average age of the test and control counties.
For reference, the population of HKSAR is approximately 7.45 million people [8]. In another study, there was no risk of transmission from two infected hairstylists and nearly 139 clients, of which the mean age was 52 years old (age range, 21–93 years), and this was attributed to the use of masks [9]. Furthermore, evaluation of 382 sailors (interquartile age range, 24–35 years) on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US navy ship, found that those who took extra precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as mask-wearing, had a 70.0% reduction in transmission when compared to those who did not wear masks [10]. Another study looking at 15 US states (plus Washington, D.C.) with mandated mask requirements found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate [11].

* The molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 shows that it is not created in a lab or engineered. The backbone of the virus differs from coronaviruses already known to scientists and resembles viruses found in bats and pangolins.
* A draft study associated with a group founded by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, released on March 25, 2020, by Chinese virologist Li-Meng Yan and three colleagues, also supports the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2.
* A team of researchers from Britain and Norway claimed in a research paper that current efforts to make a coronavirus vaccine are likely to fail because scientists have fundamentally misunderstood the virus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. However, virologists have fiercely debunked this claim.
* Researchers with Scripps Research and other institutions around the globe published a study in the journal Nature Medicine debunking the theory that the novel coronavirus is manmade.

Based on the information provided, the claim that "The new coronavirus was not man-made, study shows" is TRUE. The scientific consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes and is not a product of laboratory engineering. The molecular structure of the virus and its similarities to SARS and other viruses found in bats and pangolins support this conclusion. Multiple studies and experts in the field have confirmed this conclusion, and there is no evidence to suggest that the virus was created in a lab.

Under Victoria's second trigger point, the curfew will not be removed unless there are fewer than a total of 0.75 unexplained cases per million people over 14 days.
These rates can then be applied to case number rates in NSW. For example, under Victoria's roadmap, the state must have a daily average of less than 0.75 cases per million people, over 14 days to reach the third step.

Melbourne University's Dallas English, chair of epidemiology and biostats at the Melbourne School Of Population And Global Health, said "on the numbers" Mr Morrison was right. Professor English said case numbers had been steadily decreasing by an average of 7 per cent per day since the peak on August 5. But he suggested it would be difficult to achieve Victoria's thresholds. "We know NSW has been very successful, but they do have cases bubbling along," he said.

Premier Dominic Perrottet is resisting widespread calls to revert to mask mandates indoors but national cabinet is meeting on Wednesday to discuss the latest COVID-19 crisis, amid speculation masks rules will be reimposed and booster shots expedited. Meanwhile, NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns is isolating at home after one of his staffers contracted the virus. He criticised Mr Perrottet’s refusal to heed the calls from experts and reintroduce mask mandates indoors.
From Tuesday fully vaccinated overseas travellers entering NSW will no longer have to isolate for 72 hours. Overseas arrivals to Sydney will have to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours and isolate at home until they return a negative result. Victoria is considering tightening indoor mask mandates, but will not introduce wholesale restriction changes for Christmas gatherings and major events to stave off an Omicron case spike.
In the absence of Premier Daniel Andrews, Mr Merlino will stand-in as the Victorian representative at Wednesday’s “informal” virtual meeting of national cabinet. There he will join South Australia in calling for the COVID-19 vaccine booster interval to be reduced for a second time, down from five months. “I want it as short as possible,” Mr Merlino said.

Information 4 and 5 are not relevant to the claim, as they do not provide any information about the case numbers in NSW or Victoria at any specific time.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on 2020-09-20, states that COVID-19 case numbers in NSW were higher than the threshold to lift the curfew in Victoria when Mr. Morrison made his claim. According to Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, this claim is true. NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days.

Reasoning:

The claim was published on 2020-09-20, and Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, confirms that NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days. Therefore, the claim is true based on the available information.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax and a warning about this risk is included in its product information. These reports are very rare, and the events reported are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. People should come forward for their second and booster vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise · It is important that anyone who experiences new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart seeks medical attention.
Up to 23 August 2022, 53 million people received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 50 million received a second dose and 40 million received a third or booster dose. Safety monitoring throughout the deployment showed that the most common adverse reactions for all the COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting ‘reactogenicity’-type events such as fever, fatigue and injection site pain.
The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected adverse incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients, users, or carers). The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.
Everyone aged 5 years and over is eligible to receive a first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. People aged 16 years and over, and some children aged 12 to 15, are also eligible to receive a booster dose. People aged 5 years and over who had a severely weakened immune system when they had their first 2 doses, will be offered a third dose before any booster doses.

US President Donald Trump has been lambasted by the medical community after suggesting research into whether coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body.
While noting the research should be treated with caution, Mr Trump suggested further research in that area.

Mr Trump has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxycloroquine, as a possible treatment for coronavirus, though he has stopped touting that drug recently. This week a study of coronavirus patients in a US government-run hospital for military veterans found more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than those treated with standard care. Reacting to the president's remarks on Thursday evening, Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger in November's White House election, tweeted: "UV light?

Title: Did Trump Suggest Injecting Disinfectant Could Be COVID-19 Treatment?
Content:
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments. "Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines," she said. Other Trump defenders noted that Trump clarified later in the briefing that disinfectants would not, in fact, be administered "through injections," but the "clarification" itself was less than clear.
Bryan's presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces. But when Trump took the podium, he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were "brought inside the body" to fight the virus. Here's the official White House transcript of Trump's remarks (emphasis added): THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
While medical experts and cleaning-supply companies feared Trump's suggestion that disinfectants could be injected as a treatment for COVID-19 could result in people poisoning themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products, some of the president's supporters claimed his remarks were taken out of context. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments.
U.S. President Donald Trump said, with regard to possible medical treatments for COVID-19: "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning."

Information 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 all discuss the same event, which is President Trump's suggestion during a press briefing on April 23, 2020, to explore the possibility of using disinfectants as a treatment for COVID-19 by injecting or ingesting them. The suggestion was met with criticism and concern from the medical community and the public. The White House later claimed that the media was mischaracterizing Trump's comments.

In response to the backlash, President Trump claimed that he was being sarcastic when he made the suggestion. However, video footage of the briefing shows that he was serious when he made the comments. Additionally, medical experts and cleaning-supply companies expressed concern that people might poison themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products based on Trump's suggestion.

In summary, the claim that President Trump urged people to ingest or inject disinfectants as a treatment for coronavirus is true, as evidenced by the information published on April 24, 2020, and later dates. However, it is worth noting that Trump later claimed that his comments were sarcastic, although this claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Most vaccines need to be stored within 1 degree Fahrenheit of their ideal temperature. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures.
Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures. Moderna’s vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas Pfizer’s vaccine candidate requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typical restaurant freezers have a range of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and simply can’t reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. Specialized equipment is needed. Several major logistics companies, including UPS and DHL, are already investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management. UPS is adding freezer farms of 600 freezers capable of reaching minus 80 degrees Celsius near UPS air hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and the Netherlands.
This will depend on the refrigeration capacity of health care organizations and hospitals, staffing resources, the locations the vaccines will be given and many other factors, including the shelf life of the vaccine itself. Finally, there is the simple problem of how to expand shipping and storage capacity.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published on September 19, 2020, explains that an effective vaccine is the first step, but delivering hundreds of millions of doses that may need to be kept at arctic temperatures is another challenge. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Moderna's vaccine requiring -4 degrees Fahrenheit and Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Information 2, published on November 3, 2020, reiterates the temperature requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine candidates and adds that typical restaurant freezers cannot reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. It also explains that companies like UPS and DHL are investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management.

Information 3, with no publication date, is almost identical to Information 2.

Information 4, with no publication date, emphasizes the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling practices.

Information 5, with no publication date, explains the different temperature ranges for vaccine storage, including ultralow at -70 degrees Celsius, frozen at -20 degrees Celsius, and refrigerated between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It also mentions that not many facilities can handle -70 degrees Celsius, but large universities, some large hospitals, and pharmacy chain distribution centers may have the required storage.

Claim: The claim was published on September 17, 2020, and states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero.

Analysis: Given the information provided, it is clear that the claim was made before specific vaccine candidates' temperature requirements were publicly known. Information became available on September 19, 2020, that some leading COVID-19 vaccines needed to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the claim does not specify which vaccines need to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or not, as it lacks specificity. Nonetheless, considering the information about the temperature requirements for some COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is plausible that some vaccines need to be shipped at temperatures around -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Content:
Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.
That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.

So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments. Those statutes pre-authorized the executive branch (which the Governor heads) to take certain, specific actions when the state is facing an emergency.
In those instances, the State invoked more familiar provisions of the statutes governing declarations of emergency, including freeing up money earmarked for emergency use; calling on the national guard to help with the effects of the storm; and allowing the police to redirect traffic. But the Governor’s statutory powers during an emergency are broad, flexible, and include the ability to “make such orders.

Information 5, published on February 21, 2020, highlights the National Governors Association's role in connecting governors and sharing guidance on addressing COVID-19 challenges.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on December 27, 2020, states that governors in many states, including the author's own state, are closing down businesses again. Given the information presented, it is reasonable to assume that governors do have the authority to close businesses during a state of emergency, as explained in Information 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, Information 4 shows that some business owners in Washington State blame Governor Inslee for their struggles, indicating that businesses have been closed in that state.

Considering the timeline of the information, all sources point to the fact that governors can close businesses during a state of emergency, and some have done so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the claim is likely true, as governors do have the authority to close businesses in their states during emergencies.

Title: Does Mouthwash Kill COVID? Research and Facts
Content:
Even when research was promising on the use of mouthwashes to help control the spread of the new coronavirus, researchers stopped short of making such a recommendation. In fact, even the makers of Listerine offered up a statement confirming that there was no evidence-based research in favor of mouthwashes as a COVID control or prevention tool. While mouthwashes may help create an inhospitable environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no evidence to suggest it’s effective at controlling the spread of the virus.
While mouthwashes may help create an inhospitable environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no evidence to suggest it’s effective at controlling the spread of the virus. There’s also no evidence that it’s effective at treating active infections. Some things to consider before relying on mouthwash as a way to prevent COVID include: The new coronavirus collects in nasal passages, not just in the throat.
Other studies confirmed that some mouthwashes could reduce or even · destroy detectable virus levels in saliva, but these results were really only observed when mouthwashes were used for more than 30 seconds. Even when research was promising on the use of mouthwashes to help control the spread of the new coronavirus, researchers stopped short of making such a recommendation.
Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic, researchers have been scrambling to figure out possible ways to stem virus transmission and halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One idea that’s been researched throughout 2020 and into 2021 is that the virus can be killed — or, at the very least, slowed down — by over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes.

Title: What to know about mouthwash and COVID-19
Content:
Emerging studies suggest that although they are not primary targets for infection, the salivary glands and throat are important sites of virus transmission and replication in the early stages of COVID-19. This may mean that using mouthwash could be a helpful tool for preventing the spread of the virus.
This may mean that using mouthwash could be a helpful tool for preventing the spread of the virus. However, at this stage, studies are too small and short term for researchers to make conclusive statements, and further research is necessary. A 2020 study suggested that mouthwashes containing certain ingredients may break down or destroy the SARS-CoV-2 viral lipid envelope, which acts as protection for the virus.
While some studies found that mouthwash could create a hostile environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, research does not support that it can treat active infections or control the spread of the virus. Finally, although mouthwash may have an effect on the virus in the mouth and throat, COVID-19 also collects in nasal passages.
Even if mouthwash could effectively kill the virus in the throat, it would remain in the nasal passages, which could pass the virus down to the throat. ... CDC recommends that people who are not fully vaccinated wear cloth face masks in indoor public settings. If case numbers are high in the area, it may be best to wear a mask outdoors, as well. This will help slow the spread of the virus from people who do not know that they have contracted it, including those who are asymptomatic.

Title: Certain Mouthwashes Might Stop COVID-19 Virus Transmission | Rutgers ...
Content:
Fine cautions the public against relying on mouthwash as a way to slow the spread until it is proven in clinical trials on humans. “The ultimate goal would be to determine whether rinsing two or three times a day with an antiseptic agent with active anti-viral activity would have the potential to reduce the ability to transmit the disease. But this needs to be investigated in a real-world situation,’’ he said. Previous research has shown various types of antiseptic mouthwashes can disrupt the novel coronavirus and temporarily prevent transmission, but this was one of the first studies that examined antiseptic rinse concentrations, time of contact and the skin-cell killing properties that simulated oral conditions.
The study, published in the journal Pathogens, found that Listerine and the prescription mouthwash Chlorhexidine disrupted the virus within seconds after being diluted to concentrations that would mimic actual use. Further studies are needed to test real-life efficacy in humans.
The study was conducted in a lab using concentrations of the mouthwash and the time it would take to contact tissues to replicate conditions found in the mouth, said Daniel H. Fine, the paper’s senior author and chair of the school’s Department of Oral Biology.
The study found two other mouthwashes showed promise in potentially providing some protection in preventing viral transmission: Betadine, which contains Povidone-iodine, and Peroxal, which contains hydrogen peroxide. However, only Listerine and Chlorhexidine disrupted the virus with little impact on skin cells inside the mouth that provide a protective barrier against the virus.

Title: Oral Rinses May Reduce Coronavirus Transmission
Content:
A swirl of mouthwash may be good for more than minty-fresh breath. A few recent studies suggest that certain oral rinses have the potential to help reduce transmission of the new coronavirus, though more research is needed to determine just how big of a role they can play in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Researchers out of Penn State College of Medicine tested several oral and nasal rinses for their ability to inactivate a human coronavirus — not the one that causes COVID-19, but its cold-causing cousin that is similar in structure.
“This is something anybody can go to the store, buy and use it the way it's meant to be used and maybe lessen the spread” while we wait for a vaccine, Meyers points out. That said, there are some risks associated with misusing rinses. One potential downside: Frequent use could change the microbiome in the mouth and nose, which includes the good germs, Hoffman points out. Alcohol-based mouthwashes can also lead to irritation, and iodine-based rinses can interfere with the function of the thyroid. Similar to other chemicals that kill the coronavirus, misusing the rinses by swallowing them or inhaling them can also cause harm.
What they found is that a few common over-the-counter products — including Crest Pro-Health, Listerine Ultra, Listerine Antiseptic and similar store-brand antiseptics — killed over 99.9 percent of the human coronavirus after 30 seconds of exposure in a laboratory setting. A 1 percent solution of baby shampoo, which is often recommended by doctors to rinse the sinuses, also mostly inactivated the virus after two minutes. The study was published in the Journal of Medical Virology. What's more, researchers in Germany found that a few commercially available oral rinses, including an iso-Betadine mouthwash and Listerine Cool Mint, “significantly reduced viral infectivity” of SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus responsible for the current pandemic — “to undetectable levels” after an exposure time of 30 seconds in a laboratory setting.
Preliminary research suggests that oral rinses may reduce coronavirus transmission. But scientists caution that this will not replace other measures.
