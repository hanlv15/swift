Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.
Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19. With this, COVID-19 can cause overall worsening of these conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, etc.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Content:
SINGAPORE - Using a throat spray or consuming the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has been found to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection in healthy individuals in areas with high transmission rates. These findings were revealed by a local study of more than 3,000 healthy young migrant workers who were quarantined in Tuas South Dormitory in May last year. The study found that taking a povidone-iodine throat spray three times a day, or the oral drug hydroxychloroquine once daily, reduced the likelihood of getting infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, by over 20 per cent.
Prof Seet said: "Oral hydroxychloroquine or povidone-iodine throat spray are existing drugs that are easily available and have known safety profiles. This can represent a viable preventive strategy for individuals living in a closed and high-exposure setting, especially in areas and countries where Covid-19 vaccination is not available or widespread."
Repurposing accessible existing drugs such as povidone-iodine and hydroxychloroquine is a practical way to curb the spread of the virus, especially in regions where Covid-19 is rampant, said Prof Seet. The throat spray can be bought over the counter at pharmacies while hydroxychloroquine will require a doctor's prescription.
The men were split into five groups, with each group given one of the following for six weeks: vitamin C (control group), zinc and vitamin C, the povidone-iodine throat spray, hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. At that time, Covid-19 clusters were still rampant in Singapore's dormitories, and residents were isolated or quarantined in their rooms which they shared with other residents.

The molecular structure of the virus and its similarities to SARS and other viruses found in bats and pangolins support this conclusion. Multiple studies and experts in the field have confirmed this conclusion, and there is no evidence to suggest that the virus was created in a lab.

Melbourne University's Dallas English, chair of epidemiology and biostats at the Melbourne School Of Population And Global Health, said "on the numbers" Mr Morrison was right. Professor English said case numbers had been steadily decreasing by an average of 7 per cent per day since the peak on August 5. But he suggested it would be difficult to achieve Victoria's thresholds. "We know NSW has been very successful, but they do have cases bubbling along," he said.

Premier Dominic Perrottet is resisting widespread calls to revert to mask mandates indoors but national cabinet is meeting on Wednesday to discuss the latest COVID-19 crisis, amid speculation masks rules will be reimposed and booster shots expedited. Meanwhile, NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns is isolating at home after one of his staffers contracted the virus. He criticised Mr Perrottet’s refusal to heed the calls from experts and reintroduce mask mandates indoors.
From Tuesday fully vaccinated overseas travellers entering NSW will no longer have to isolate for 72 hours. Overseas arrivals to Sydney will have to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours and isolate at home until they return a negative result. Victoria is considering tightening indoor mask mandates, but will not introduce wholesale restriction changes for Christmas gatherings and major events to stave off an Omicron case spike.
In the absence of Premier Daniel Andrews, Mr Merlino will stand-in as the Victorian representative at Wednesday’s “informal” virtual meeting of national cabinet. There he will join South Australia in calling for the COVID-19 vaccine booster interval to be reduced for a second time, down from five months. “I want it as short as possible,” Mr Merlino said.

Information 4 and 5 are not relevant to the claim, as they do not provide any information about the case numbers in NSW or Victoria at any specific time.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on 2020-09-20, states that COVID-19 case numbers in NSW were higher than the threshold to lift the curfew in Victoria when Mr. Morrison made his claim. According to Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, this claim is true. NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days.

Reasoning:

The claim was published on 2020-09-20, and Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, confirms that NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days. Therefore, the claim is true based on the available information.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax and a warning about this risk is included in its product information. These reports are very rare, and the events reported are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. People should come forward for their second and booster vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise · It is important that anyone who experiences new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart seeks medical attention.
Up to 23 August 2022, 53 million people received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 50 million received a second dose and 40 million received a third or booster dose. Safety monitoring throughout the deployment showed that the most common adverse reactions for all the COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting ‘reactogenicity’-type events such as fever, fatigue and injection site pain.
The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected adverse incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients, users, or carers). The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.
Everyone aged 5 years and over is eligible to receive a first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. People aged 16 years and over, and some children aged 12 to 15, are also eligible to receive a booster dose. People aged 5 years and over who had a severely weakened immune system when they had their first 2 doses, will be offered a third dose before any booster doses.

Title: Reconcile the debate over protective effects of BCG vaccine against ...
Content:
In the 1970s, WHO launched massive immunization programs in developing countries, leading to substantial increase in BCG coverage among 1-year-olds: BCG coverage rate increased from 9% to 80% in African countries, and from 20% to 90% in European countries between 1980 and 201911. Though BCG vaccine was first developed as a prevention for tuberculosis, recent studies have found that BCG vaccine has nonspecific benefits in training the innate immunity through bestowing a type of immunological memory on innate cells12,13,14. This “trained innate immunity” has been shown to be protective against viral infections15,16. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is under debate17,18,19,20.
As targeted COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, researchers have been actively exploring the protective effects of existing vaccines, among which the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) has received much attention following observation of a coincident relationship between severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the level of BCG vaccination in one country8. The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in the 1930s and used to prevent tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the most prevalent diseases in developing countries9,10.
Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36.

Title: Study: TB Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of COVID-19
Content:
A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year.
The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.
While noting that no one believes BCG will be more effective than a specific vaccine for COVID-19, Arditi explained that it could be more quickly approved and made available, given that it has a strong safety profile demonstrated by many years of use. "It is a potentially important bridge that could offer some benefit until we have the most effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines made widely available," he said.
In fact, a number of randomized clinical trials have been launched to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Along with Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Cedars Sinai is a site for the U.S. arm of this ongoing trial, which is recruiting hundreds of healthcare workers.

Title: Frontiers | The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future ...
Content:
BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses.
In addition, since BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (17), it may help to reduce hospitalizations dure to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Here, we review some recent data that addresses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases.
Only ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will provide answers to whether BCG reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 through its cross-protective effects. The phase III randomized clinical trial ACTIVATE (NCT03296423) confirmed that recent vaccination with BCG in elderly (>65 years) protects against new infections.
The study concluded that BCG vaccination is safe, as recently reported by the same group (17), and can protect the elderly against infections. The study also suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, although larger and specific studies are needed to assess BCG protection against COVID-19.

Title: BCG Vaccine Prevents Tuberculosis in Young Children, but Not Adults ...
Content:
When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children. Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries. “The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,” he says.
Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed. “Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.
“Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology. “Our findings indicate that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children.
For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.

Information 1, published in an unspecified date, discusses the history and potential nonspecific benefits of the BCG vaccine. The vaccine, originally developed for tuberculosis prevention, has been shown to have adjuvant effects that can enhance innate immune responses and provide long-lasting protection via trained immunity. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is still under debate.

Information 2, published on 2020-11-28, is a retrospective, observational study that found people who received the BCG vaccination were less likely to report symptoms of COVID-19 and less likely to have antibodies against the infection in their blood. The BCG vaccine was developed more than 100 years ago to protect against tuberculosis.

Information 3, published on 2020-11-20, is a study by Cedars-Sinai that found a correlation between the BCG vaccine and reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19. The study raises the possibility that the vaccine may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.

Information 4, does not have a specific publication date, discusses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases. The study concludes that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections, and suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Information 5, also does not have a specific publication date, states that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children, but has a limited efficacy as a booster and new vaccines are needed.

The claim, published on 2020-04-20, states that recent news and media claims that the Tuberculosis vaccine- BCG may be effective against COVID-19. Based on the information provided, it is true that recent studies and news have reported a potential protective effect of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19, however, the evidence is not yet conclusive and ongoing randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Information 1, published on September 19, 2020, explains that an effective vaccine is the first step, but delivering hundreds of millions of doses that may need to be kept at arctic temperatures is another challenge. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Moderna's vaccine requiring -4 degrees Fahrenheit and Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Information 2, published on November 3, 2020, reiterates the temperature requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine candidates and adds that typical restaurant freezers cannot reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. It also explains that companies like UPS and DHL are investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management.

Information 3, with no publication date, is almost identical to Information 2.

Information 4, with no publication date, emphasizes the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling practices.

Information 5, with no publication date, explains the different temperature ranges for vaccine storage, including ultralow at -70 degrees Celsius, frozen at -20 degrees Celsius, and refrigerated between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It also mentions that not many facilities can handle -70 degrees Celsius, but large universities, some large hospitals, and pharmacy chain distribution centers may have the required storage.

Claim: The claim was published on September 17, 2020, and states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero.

Analysis: Given the information provided, it is clear that the claim was made before specific vaccine candidates' temperature requirements were publicly known. Information became available on September 19, 2020, that some leading COVID-19 vaccines needed to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the claim does not specify which vaccines need to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or not, as it lacks specificity. Nonetheless, considering the information about the temperature requirements for some COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is plausible that some vaccines need to be shipped at temperatures around -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Can the state tell your favorite local restaurant to close, or tell you that you must stay at home unless it’s absolutely necessary to leave, because of an emergency? The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have closed down bars, movie theaters and dine-in restaurants.
In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed that “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” · What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country? State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary.

As reported by Business Insider ( here ), 32 state governors had issued a state of emergency in response to the new coronavirus before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020 ( here ). Governor Jay Inslee of Washington was the first to do so, issuing a COVID-19 emergency proclamation on February 29 ( here ).
According to the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization, “No federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions… If governors choose to disregard his call to reopen their states, their decisions will be final” ( here ).
The National Governors Association explains: “State emergency management laws usually define how a governor may declare and end a state of emergency” ( here ). In other words, state statutes have already granted the governor the authority to declare and manage a state of emergency.

Title: Can the Government Really Shut Down My Business and Make Me Stay Home?
Content:
Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.
That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people. He must do only those things which comply with the laws enacted by the legislature (as interpreted by judges). So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments.
So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments. Those statutes pre-authorized the executive branch (which the Governor heads) to take certain, specific actions when the state is facing an emergency.
In those instances, the State invoked more familiar provisions of the statutes governing declarations of emergency, including freeing up money earmarked for emergency use; calling on the national guard to help with the effects of the storm; and allowing the police to redirect traffic. But the Governor’s statutory powers during an emergency are broad, flexible, and include the ability to “make such orders.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published without a date, explains that state and local governments have the authority to force businesses to close and impose restrictions on individuals during emergencies, based on a Supreme Court case from 1905.

Information 2, published on May 12, 2020, states that governors have the authority to declare a state of emergency and manage it according to state laws. The National Governors Association explains that no federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions.

Information 3, without a publication date, explains the process of how a governor can issue executive orders during a state of emergency, and these orders must comply with the laws enacted by the legislature.

Information 4, published on July 20, 2020, discusses the impact of Washington State Governor Inslee's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses, with some business owners blaming the governor for their struggles.

Information 5, published on February 21, 2020, highlights the National Governors Association's role in connecting governors and sharing guidance on addressing COVID-19 challenges.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on December 27, 2020, states that governors in many states, including the author's own state, are closing down businesses again. Given the information presented, it is reasonable to assume that governors do have the authority to close businesses during a state of emergency, as explained in Information 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, Information 4 shows that some business owners in Washington State blame Governor Inslee for their struggles, indicating that businesses have been closed in that state.

Considering the timeline of the information, all sources point to the fact that governors can close businesses during a state of emergency, and some have done so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the claim is likely true, as governors do have the authority to close businesses in their states during emergencies.

Title: Does Mouthwash Kill COVID? Research and Facts
Content:
Even when research was promising on the use of mouthwashes to help control the spread of the new coronavirus, researchers stopped short of making such a recommendation. In fact, even the makers of Listerine offered up a statement confirming that there was no evidence-based research in favor of mouthwashes as a COVID control or prevention tool. While mouthwashes may help create an inhospitable environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no evidence to suggest it’s effective at controlling the spread of the virus.
While mouthwashes may help create an inhospitable environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no evidence to suggest it’s effective at controlling the spread of the virus. There’s also no evidence that it’s effective at treating active infections. Some things to consider before relying on mouthwash as a way to prevent COVID include: The new coronavirus collects in nasal passages, not just in the throat.
Other studies confirmed that some mouthwashes could reduce or even · destroy detectable virus levels in saliva, but these results were really only observed when mouthwashes were used for more than 30 seconds. Even when research was promising on the use of mouthwashes to help control the spread of the new coronavirus, researchers stopped short of making such a recommendation.
Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic, researchers have been scrambling to figure out possible ways to stem virus transmission and halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One idea that’s been researched throughout 2020 and into 2021 is that the virus can be killed — or, at the very least, slowed down — by over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes.

Title: What to know about mouthwash and COVID-19
Content:
Emerging studies suggest that although they are not primary targets for infection, the salivary glands and throat are important sites of virus transmission and replication in the early stages of COVID-19. This may mean that using mouthwash could be a helpful tool for preventing the spread of the virus.
This may mean that using mouthwash could be a helpful tool for preventing the spread of the virus. However, at this stage, studies are too small and short term for researchers to make conclusive statements, and further research is necessary. A 2020 study suggested that mouthwashes containing certain ingredients may break down or destroy the SARS-CoV-2 viral lipid envelope, which acts as protection for the virus.
While some studies found that mouthwash could create a hostile environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, research does not support that it can treat active infections or control the spread of the virus. Finally, although mouthwash may have an effect on the virus in the mouth and throat, COVID-19 also collects in nasal passages.
Even if mouthwash could effectively kill the virus in the throat, it would remain in the nasal passages, which could pass the virus down to the throat. ... CDC recommends that people who are not fully vaccinated wear cloth face masks in indoor public settings. If case numbers are high in the area, it may be best to wear a mask outdoors, as well. This will help slow the spread of the virus from people who do not know that they have contracted it, including those who are asymptomatic.

Title: Certain Mouthwashes Might Stop COVID-19 Virus Transmission | Rutgers ...
Content:
Fine cautions the public against relying on mouthwash as a way to slow the spread until it is proven in clinical trials on humans. “The ultimate goal would be to determine whether rinsing two or three times a day with an antiseptic agent with active anti-viral activity would have the potential to reduce the ability to transmit the disease. But this needs to be investigated in a real-world situation,’’ he said. Previous research has shown various types of antiseptic mouthwashes can disrupt the novel coronavirus and temporarily prevent transmission, but this was one of the first studies that examined antiseptic rinse concentrations, time of contact and the skin-cell killing properties that simulated oral conditions.
The study, published in the journal Pathogens, found that Listerine and the prescription mouthwash Chlorhexidine disrupted the virus within seconds after being diluted to concentrations that would mimic actual use. Further studies are needed to test real-life efficacy in humans.
The study was conducted in a lab using concentrations of the mouthwash and the time it would take to contact tissues to replicate conditions found in the mouth, said Daniel H. Fine, the paper’s senior author and chair of the school’s Department of Oral Biology.
The study found two other mouthwashes showed promise in potentially providing some protection in preventing viral transmission: Betadine, which contains Povidone-iodine, and Peroxal, which contains hydrogen peroxide. However, only Listerine and Chlorhexidine disrupted the virus with little impact on skin cells inside the mouth that provide a protective barrier against the virus.

Title: Oral Rinses May Reduce Coronavirus Transmission
Content:
A swirl of mouthwash may be good for more than minty-fresh breath. A few recent studies suggest that certain oral rinses have the potential to help reduce transmission of the new coronavirus, though more research is needed to determine just how big of a role they can play in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Researchers out of Penn State College of Medicine tested several oral and nasal rinses for their ability to inactivate a human coronavirus — not the one that causes COVID-19, but its cold-causing cousin that is similar in structure.
“This is something anybody can go to the store, buy and use it the way it's meant to be used and maybe lessen the spread” while we wait for a vaccine, Meyers points out. That said, there are some risks associated with misusing rinses. One potential downside: Frequent use could change the microbiome in the mouth and nose, which includes the good germs, Hoffman points out. Alcohol-based mouthwashes can also lead to irritation, and iodine-based rinses can interfere with the function of the thyroid. Similar to other chemicals that kill the coronavirus, misusing the rinses by swallowing them or inhaling them can also cause harm.
What they found is that a few common over-the-counter products — including Crest Pro-Health, Listerine Ultra, Listerine Antiseptic and similar store-brand antiseptics — killed over 99.9 percent of the human coronavirus after 30 seconds of exposure in a laboratory setting. A 1 percent solution of baby shampoo, which is often recommended by doctors to rinse the sinuses, also mostly inactivated the virus after two minutes. The study was published in the Journal of Medical Virology. What's more, researchers in Germany found that a few commercially available oral rinses, including an iso-Betadine mouthwash and Listerine Cool Mint, “significantly reduced viral infectivity” of SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus responsible for the current pandemic — “to undetectable levels” after an exposure time of 30 seconds in a laboratory setting.
Preliminary research suggests that oral rinses may reduce coronavirus transmission. But scientists caution that this will not replace other measures.

In summary, the information provided does not definitively prove that mouthwash can reduce the spread of the new coronavirus. However, some studies suggest that mouthwash could be a helpful tool for preventing the spread of the virus. Further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of mouthwash in reducing the spread of the virus. Therefore, the claim is partially true, but it should be considered in the context of the available information and with the understanding that more research is needed.
