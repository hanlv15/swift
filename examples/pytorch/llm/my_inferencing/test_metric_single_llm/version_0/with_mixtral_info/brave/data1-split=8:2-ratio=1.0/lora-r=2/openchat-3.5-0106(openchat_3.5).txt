Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Content:
COVID-19 leads to blood clots in a significant number of people who have a severe form of the disease. In an interview with Medical News Today, thrombosis expert Prof. Beverley Hunt explains why blood clots are dangerous for those with the new coronavirus.
She is a professor of thrombosis and hemostasis and works for the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) in London. Prof. Hunt told MNT about the biology of blood clotting, her surprise at how the new coronavirus changes the properties of the blood in those with severe disease, and why we should keep moving, even during lockdown, to reduce our risk of thrombosis.
Now we know that these patients have incredibly sticky blood. This stickiness is causing them to have deep vein thrombosis. And of course, if you have a deep vein thrombosis, bits of it can break off and travel through your body and block some of the blood supply to the lungs.
But why would a virus that primarily infects the respiratory tract cause blood clots? And how is this putting patients at serious risk? Prof. Beverley Hunt is the medical director of the British charity Thrombosis UK, as well as chair of the steering group for World Thrombosis Day.

Content:
Covid-19 causes massive inflammation boosting cytokines, which increase the liver’s production of clotting factors, explains Beverley Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK and a practising clinician. For example, fibrinogen levels in a severely ill covid-19 patient are 10-14 g/L, compared with 2-4 g/L normally and 5-6 g/L in a pregnant woman. “A covid patient’s blood is enormously sticky,” she told The BMJ.
“All patients in critical care are at increased risk from clots because they are immobile, and when you are sick you have sticky blood,” says Hunt. Studies of venous thromboembolism rates among non-covid patients in critical care show that rates of thrombosis can be as high as 28% if patients are not given any prophylaxis.
“If you have less viral load, you would have less inflammation, less sticky blood, and less VTE [venous thromboembolism] and immunothrombosis,” she says. NHS England commissioned a group of experts to write clinical guidance on thrombosis and critical care for patients with covid, which was submitted for dissemination on 28 April.
The authors said that this level was “remarkably high,” given that all patients received at least standard doses of thromboprophylaxis. Other studies from France and the Netherlands have also suggested that thrombosis occurs in 20-30% of critically ill covid-19 patients, even with prophylaxis.23

Hunt: In 1846, the German pathologist Rudolf Virchow described three things that predispose people to venous thrombosis. ... Of these, probably the most important for is the flow. Standing for only 90 minutes without moving our legs, the blood flow decreases by about 50%. Therefore, we depend entirely on movement to maintain blood flow. This is a major risk factor for patients in the hospital, for someone who is sick and is mobilized in bed, but also for anyone who stays motionless for long periods of time. Blood viscosity is another very important indicator of our health.
Blood viscosity is another very important indicator of our health. Increased viscosity adversely affects the condition of the heart, blood vessels and all internal organs. In the presence of such a condition, there is a risk of blood clots and other negative manifestations.

Content:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition that causes blood clotting, or thrombosis, in patients (here). While studies have found patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms can present with coagulation abnormalities, this does not mean that COVID-19 has been misdiagnosed or incorrectly treated.(here) The British Medical Journal (BMJ) states that doctors are seeing high rates of blood clots in patients who are seriously ill with COVID-19. It explains that “a covid patient’s blood is enormously sticky” because the disease has increased the liver’s production of clotting factors (here).
The post, examples of which can be seen (here) and (here) , states: “Italy defeats the so-called Covid-19, which is nothing but ‘diffuse intravascular coagulation’ (thrombosis). Italian doctors have disobeyed the WHO law prohibiting the autopsy of corpses from the coronavirus, as they have discovered that it is not a virus but the bacteria that cause death and the formation of blood clots.”
Partly False. COVID-19 is not the same as thrombosis. It is caused by a virus not bacteria. The symptoms of COVID-19 can be treated with anticoagulants and anti-inflammatories, but antibiotics are not effective against the viral infection, and are only recommended for COVID-19 patients who also have a bacterial infection.

A study from Sweden published by The BMJ today finds an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the leg) up to three months after covid-19 infection, pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung) up to six months, and a bleeding event up to two months.
They then performed two analyses: in the first, they calculated the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding in covid-19 individuals during a control period (before and long after covid-19 diagnosis) and compared it to the rates in different time intervals after covid-19 diagnosis (days 1-7, 8-14, 15-30, 31-60, 61-90, and 91-180).
In the second analysis, they calculated the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding during the period 1-30 days after covid-19 diagnosis in the covid-19 group and compared them to the corresponding rates in the control group.
After taking account of a range of potentially influential factors, the researchers found a fivefold increase in risk of deep vein thrombosis, a 33-fold increase in risk of pulmonary embolism, and an almost twofold increase in risk of bleeding in the 30 days after infection.

Information summary:

* COVID-19 can lead to blood clots in a significant number of people with severe disease.
* A thrombosis expert, Prof. Beverley Hunt, has noted that the blood of patients with severe COVID-19 is "incredibly sticky," which can cause deep vein thrombosis and increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
* The increase in blood stickiness is due to the massive inflammation caused by COVID-19, which boosts cytokines and increases the liver's production of clotting factors.
* The risk of thrombosis is higher in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and even with prophylaxis, the rates of thrombosis can be as high as 28%.
* Blood viscosity is another important factor in thrombosis, and movement is necessary to maintain blood flow and reduce the risk of thrombosis.
* A study published in 2022 found an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding up to six months after COVID-19 infection.

Based on the information provided, the claim is mostly accurate. COVID-19 can lead to "sticky blood" and an increased risk of thrombosis, especially in patients with severe disease. The information from the thrombosis expert, Prof. Beverley Hunt, supports this claim, and the 2022 study also found an increased risk of thrombosis up to six months after COVID-19 infection. However, the claim incorrectly states that COVID-19 is thrombosis, which is not accurate. COVID-19 is a viral infection, while thrombosis is a condition caused by blood clots. Therefore, the claim should be classified as partially false.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax and a warning about this risk is included in its product information. These reports are very rare, and the events reported are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. People should come forward for their second and booster vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise · It is important that anyone who experiences new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart seeks medical attention.
Up to 23 August 2022, 53 million people received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 50 million received a second dose and 40 million received a third or booster dose. Safety monitoring throughout the deployment showed that the most common adverse reactions for all the COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting ‘reactogenicity’-type events such as fever, fatigue and injection site pain.
The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected adverse incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients, users, or carers). The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.
Everyone aged 5 years and over is eligible to receive a first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. People aged 16 years and over, and some children aged 12 to 15, are also eligible to receive a booster dose. People aged 5 years and over who had a severely weakened immune system when they had their first 2 doses, will be offered a third dose before any booster doses.

Title: Reconcile the debate over protective effects of BCG vaccine against ...
Content:
In the 1970s, WHO launched massive immunization programs in developing countries, leading to substantial increase in BCG coverage among 1-year-olds: BCG coverage rate increased from 9% to 80% in African countries, and from 20% to 90% in European countries between 1980 and 201911. Though BCG vaccine was first developed as a prevention for tuberculosis, recent studies have found that BCG vaccine has nonspecific benefits in training the innate immunity through bestowing a type of immunological memory on innate cells12,13,14. This “trained innate immunity” has been shown to be protective against viral infections15,16. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is under debate17,18,19,20.
As targeted COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, researchers have been actively exploring the protective effects of existing vaccines, among which the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) has received much attention following observation of a coincident relationship between severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the level of BCG vaccination in one country8. The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in the 1930s and used to prevent tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the most prevalent diseases in developing countries9,10.
Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36.

Title: Study: TB Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of COVID-19
Content:
A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year.
The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.
While noting that no one believes BCG will be more effective than a specific vaccine for COVID-19, Arditi explained that it could be more quickly approved and made available, given that it has a strong safety profile demonstrated by many years of use. "It is a potentially important bridge that could offer some benefit until we have the most effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines made widely available," he said.
In fact, a number of randomized clinical trials have been launched to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Along with Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Cedars Sinai is a site for the U.S. arm of this ongoing trial, which is recruiting hundreds of healthcare workers.

Title: Frontiers | The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future ...
Content:
BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses.
In addition, since BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (17), it may help to reduce hospitalizations dure to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Here, we review some recent data that addresses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases.
Only ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will provide answers to whether BCG reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 through its cross-protective effects. The phase III randomized clinical trial ACTIVATE (NCT03296423) confirmed that recent vaccination with BCG in elderly (>65 years) protects against new infections.
The study concluded that BCG vaccination is safe, as recently reported by the same group (17), and can protect the elderly against infections. The study also suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, although larger and specific studies are needed to assess BCG protection against COVID-19.

Title: BCG Vaccine Prevents Tuberculosis in Young Children, but Not Adults ...
Content:
When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children. Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries. “The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,” he says.
Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed. “Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.
“Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology. “Our findings indicate that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children.
For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.

Information 1, published in an unspecified date, discusses the history and potential nonspecific benefits of the BCG vaccine. The vaccine, originally developed for tuberculosis prevention, has been shown to have adjuvant effects that can enhance innate immune responses and provide long-lasting protection via trained immunity. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is still under debate.

Information 2, published on 2020-11-28, is a retrospective, observational study that found people who received the BCG vaccination were less likely to report symptoms of COVID-19 and less likely to have antibodies against the infection in their blood. The BCG vaccine was developed more than 100 years ago to protect against tuberculosis.

Information 3, published on 2020-11-20, is a study by Cedars-Sinai that found a correlation between the BCG vaccine and reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19. The study raises the possibility that the vaccine may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.

Information 4, does not have a specific publication date, discusses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases. The study concludes that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections, and suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Information 5, also does not have a specific publication date, states that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children, but has a limited efficacy as a booster and new vaccines are needed.

The claim, published on 2020-04-20, states that recent news and media claims that the Tuberculosis vaccine- BCG may be effective against COVID-19. Based on the information provided, it is true that recent studies and news have reported a potential protective effect of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19, however, the evidence is not yet conclusive and ongoing randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

It also mentions that not many facilities can handle -70 degrees Celsius, but large universities, some large hospitals, and pharmacy chain distribution centers may have the required storage.

Claim: The claim was published on September 17, 2020, and states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero.

Analysis: Given the information provided, it is clear that the claim was made before specific vaccine candidates' temperature requirements were publicly known. Information became available on September 19, 2020, that some leading COVID-19 vaccines needed to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the claim does not specify which vaccines need to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or not, as it lacks specificity. Nonetheless, considering the information about the temperature requirements for some COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is plausible that some vaccines need to be shipped at temperatures around -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on December 27, 2020, states that governors in many states, including the author's own state, are closing down businesses again. Given the information presented, it is reasonable to assume that governors do have the authority to close businesses during a state of emergency, as explained in Information 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, Information 4 shows that some business owners in Washington State blame Governor Inslee for their struggles, indicating that businesses have been closed in that state.

Considering the timeline of the information, all sources point to the fact that governors can close businesses during a state of emergency, and some have done so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the claim is likely true, as governors do have the authority to close businesses in their states during emergencies.
