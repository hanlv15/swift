Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Evidence for the effectiveness of masking on SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level has accumulated, but the additional benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. In this observational study of matched cohorts from 412 US counties between March 21 and October 20, 2020, we estimated the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence.
Subsequently, many states and counties established their own mandates of who should wear masks and when, and how public masking would be enforced. Between April and September 2020, the timing of these masking mandates was highly variable throughout the country. By the fall of 2020, guidance from local health authorities converged so that universal masking in public locations, alongside recommendations for social distancing, had become the norm in most regions. The evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level has been strong1–4 for viruses that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, spread principally through close contact with an infected person.5–9 However, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates beyond public health guidance has been less certain.

Title: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...
Content:
We considered the impact of mandates for mask use targeted only to employees in some work settings, as opposed to communitywide mandates. This evidence is critical, as states and countries worldwide begin to shift to “reopening” their economies and as foot traffic increases. Mandating the public use of masks has become a socially and politically contentious issue, with multiple protests and even acts of violence directed against masked employees and those asking customers to wear face masks.17 Face cover recommendations and mandates are part of the current set of measures, following earlier social distancing measures such as school and nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, and shelter-in-place orders being considered by states and local governments, especially as regions of the country reopen.
The state orders strongly discourage the use of any medical or surgical masks and N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders. The orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).
Exhibit 2 plots the event study estimates of changes in county-level daily COVID-19 growth rates with the employee-only face cover mandates and their 95 percent confidence intervals. All pre- and postmandate estimates were small and insignificant. Overall, these results indicate no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Exhibit 2 Event study estimates of effects of states mandating only employee use of face masks during working time on daily county-level growth rate of COVID-19 cases
Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable. These sixteen jurisdictions also have specific mandates requiring employees in certain professions to wear masks at all times while working.

The country is probably never going to come to a consensus on masks. They have become yet another source of political polarization.

Fortunately, the scientific evidence points to a reasonable compromise. Because masks work and mandates often don’t, people can make their own decisions. Anybody who wants to wear a snug, high-quality mask can do so and will be less likely to contract Covid. If anything, that approach — one-way masking — is consistent with what hospitals have long done, as Doron, the Tufts epidemiologist, points out.
Mask mandates in schools also seem to have done little to reduce the spread. Hong Kong, despite almost universal mask-wearing, recently endured one of the world’s worst Covid outbreaks. Advocates of mandates sometimes argue that they do have a big effect even if it is not evident in populationwide data, because of how many other factors are at play.
In response, many people are understandably asking what the country can do to minimize the virus’s toll in the weeks ahead. ... So far, a lot of discussion has focused on mask mandates. Schools in Philadelphia; Providence, R.I.; Berkeley, Calif.; and Brookline, Mass., have reimposed theirs, as have several colleges. Elsewhere, some people are frustrated that officials, like New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, have not done so.

Counties with less than 40,000 individuals were excluded because smaller counties tended not to have enough daily infections to analyze. Data were gathered utilizing the US Census Bureau’s 2019 population estimates [15]. Demographic data were also found utilizing the US Census Bureau’s data [16]. The demographic information recorded includes the total estimated population and the average age of the test and control counties.
For reference, the population of HKSAR is approximately 7.45 million people [8]. In another study, there was no risk of transmission from two infected hairstylists and nearly 139 clients, of which the mean age was 52 years old (age range, 21–93 years), and this was attributed to the use of masks [9]. Furthermore, evaluation of 382 sailors (interquartile age range, 24–35 years) on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US navy ship, found that those who took extra precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as mask-wearing, had a 70.0% reduction in transmission when compared to those who did not wear masks [10]. Another study looking at 15 US states (plus Washington, D.C.) with mandated mask requirements found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate [11].

Based on the information provided, the claim that "We know mask mandates work" is not entirely accurate. While there is evidence that masking at the individual level can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. Information 1 and Information 3 both found no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Information 4 also states that mask mandates often don't work. However, Information 5 found that counties with mask mandates had a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mandate. Overall, while masking can be effective, the effectiveness of mask mandates is still a matter of debate.

Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington’s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk. Cloth masks are “plenty big to allow for the free flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while still small enough to capture some of the larger respiratory droplets that could contain COVID-19,” Baker said in an email.
While it is true that some N95 masks have exhale valves and do not reduce virus spread very effectively, those recommended for frontline healthcare workers are unvented and are more effective at preventing spread. Baker agreed. “Masks (N95 or other) that have a one way valve, do allow for unfiltered air to be exhaled. For this reason, wearing this mask doesn't protect the people around you. Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for COVID-19.”
Social media posts shared thousands of times in the United States contain multiple false or misleading claims about face masks used to stop the spread of COVID-19, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks “do not filter anything” and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air.

TIME . How “America’s frontline doctors” sold access to bogus COVID-19 treatments—and left patients in the lurch.
In this mixed-methods study of high-use social media platforms, physicians from across the US and representing a range of medical specialties were found to propagate COVID-19 misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and masks on large social media and other online platforms and that many had a wide reach based on number of followers.
Outcome measures included categories of COVID-19 misinformation propagated, the number and traits of physicians engaged in misinformation propagation, and the type of online media channels used to propagate misinformation and potential reach. The propagation of COVID-19 misinformation was attributed to 52 physicians in 28 different specialties across all regions of the country. General misinformation categories included vaccines, medication, masks, and other (ie, conspiracy theories).
Forty-two physicians (80.8%) posted vaccine misinformation, 40 (76.9%) propagated information in more than 1 category, and 20 (38.5%) posted misinformation on 5 or more platforms. Major themes identified included (1) disputing vaccine safety and effectiveness, (2) promoting medical treatments lacking scientific evidence and/or US Food and Drug Administration approval, (3) disputing mask-wearing effectiveness, and (4) other (unsubstantiated claims, eg, virus origin, government lies, and other conspiracy theories).

However, the claim does not specify the type of misinformation being spread. Information 1, published on 2020-07-28, provides specific examples of false claims about face masks, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks filter nothing and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air. Dr. Marissa Baker from the University of Washington's Industrial Hygiene program confirmed that masks, including cloth and N95 masks, should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk and are effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the claim is partially true, but specific examples of misinformation should be provided to support the claim fully.

Over the 14 days leading up to Mr Morrison's press conference, NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people. Excluding returned travellers, NSW recorded a daily average of 0.91 cases per million, which is again above the threshold for stage 3. Under Victoria's second trigger point, the curfew will not be removed unless there are fewer than a total of 0.75 unexplained cases per million people over 14 days.
These rates can then be applied to case number rates in NSW. For example, under Victoria's roadmap, the state must have a daily average of less than 0.75 cases per million people, over 14 days to reach the third step.

Melbourne University's Dallas English, chair of epidemiology and biostats at the Melbourne School Of Population And Global Health, said "on the numbers" Mr Morrison was right. Professor English said case numbers had been steadily decreasing by an average of 7 per cent per day since the peak on August 5. But he suggested it would be difficult to achieve Victoria's thresholds. "We know NSW has been very successful, but they do have cases bubbling along," he said.

Premier Dominic Perrottet is resisting widespread calls to revert to mask mandates indoors but national cabinet is meeting on Wednesday to discuss the latest COVID-19 crisis, amid speculation masks rules will be reimposed and booster shots expedited. Meanwhile, NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns is isolating at home after one of his staffers contracted the virus. He criticised Mr Perrottet’s refusal to heed the calls from experts and reintroduce mask mandates indoors.
From Tuesday fully vaccinated overseas travellers entering NSW will no longer have to isolate for 72 hours. Overseas arrivals to Sydney will have to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours and isolate at home until they return a negative result. Victoria is considering tightening indoor mask mandates, but will not introduce wholesale restriction changes for Christmas gatherings and major events to stave off an Omicron case spike.
In the absence of Premier Daniel Andrews, Mr Merlino will stand-in as the Victorian representative at Wednesday’s “informal” virtual meeting of national cabinet. There he will join South Australia in calling for the COVID-19 vaccine booster interval to be reduced for a second time, down from five months. “I want it as short as possible,” Mr Merlino said.

Information Summary:

Information 1 and 2, published on 2020-09-21, are from RMIT ABC Fact Check and provide detailed analysis of the COVID-19 case numbers in NSW and Victoria. At the time of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's press conference, NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, and 0.91 cases per million people when excluding returned travelers. Victoria's curfew threshold requires fewer than a total of 0.75 unexplained cases per million people over 14 days.

Information 3, published on 2021-12-21, discusses the current COVID-19 situation in NSW and Victoria, but does not provide specific case numbers.

Information 4 and 5 are not relevant to the claim, as they do not provide any information about the case numbers in NSW or Victoria at any specific time.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on 2020-09-20, states that COVID-19 case numbers in NSW were higher than the threshold to lift the curfew in Victoria when Mr. Morrison made his claim. According to Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, this claim is true. NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days.

Reasoning:

The claim was published on 2020-09-20, and Information 2, published on 2020-09-21, confirms that NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people over 14 days, which is higher than Victoria's curfew threshold of 0.75 cases per million people over 14 days. Therefore, the claim is true based on the available information.

Myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax and a warning about this risk is included in its product information. These reports are very rare, and the events reported are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. People should come forward for their second and booster vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise · It is important that anyone who experiences new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart seeks medical attention.
Up to 23 August 2022, 53 million people received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 50 million received a second dose and 40 million received a third or booster dose. Safety monitoring throughout the deployment showed that the most common adverse reactions for all the COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting ‘reactogenicity’-type events such as fever, fatigue and injection site pain.
The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected adverse incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public (patients, users, or carers). The purpose of the scheme is to provide an early warning that the safety of a product may require further investigation.
Everyone aged 5 years and over is eligible to receive a first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. People aged 16 years and over, and some children aged 12 to 15, are also eligible to receive a booster dose. People aged 5 years and over who had a severely weakened immune system when they had their first 2 doses, will be offered a third dose before any booster doses.

Information Summary:

Information 1: The Ministry of Health NZ provides information on the side effects and adverse events of the Pfizer and Novavax vaccines.

Information 2: The CDC provides detailed information on local and systemic adverse events of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Local reactions such as injection site redness and swelling were more common after the second dose. Systemic adverse events such as fever were also more common after the second dose and in the younger group.

Information 3: The UK government's Yellow Card reporting scheme shows that the most common adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are mild and self-limiting. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Novavax.

Information 4: The FDA added a warning label on the mRNA vaccines regarding rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults after receiving the vaccine.

Information 5: The Canadian government provides information on the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, including myocarditis and pericarditis. The rates of these conditions after the booster dose with an mRNA vaccine appear to be somewhat lower than after the second dose.

Claim Verification:

The claim that media outlets report a Pfizer vaccine volunteer warning of second dose symptoms is TRUE based on the available information. Information 2 from the CDC states that local and systemic adverse events were more common after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Information 4 from the FDA also supports this claim, as they added a warning label on the mRNA vaccines regarding rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults after receiving the second dose. These symptoms are consistent with the warning from the Pfizer vaccine volunteer.

Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures. Moderna’s vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas Pfizer’s vaccine candidate requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typical restaurant freezers have a range of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and simply can’t reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine.

Information Summary:

Information 1, published on September 19, 2020, explains that an effective vaccine is the first step, but delivering hundreds of millions of doses that may need to be kept at arctic temperatures is another challenge. Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Moderna's vaccine requiring -4 degrees Fahrenheit and Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Information 2, published on November 3, 2020, reiterates the temperature requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine candidates and adds that typical restaurant freezers cannot reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine. It also explains that companies like UPS and DHL are investing in new storage facilities for cold chain management.

Information 3, with no publication date, is almost identical to Information 2.

Information 4, with no publication date, emphasizes the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling practices.

Information 5, with no publication date, explains the different temperature ranges for vaccine storage, including ultralow at -70 degrees Celsius, frozen at -20 degrees Celsius, and refrigerated between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It also mentions that not many facilities can handle -70 degrees Celsius, but large universities, some large hospitals, and pharmacy chain distribution centers may have the required storage.

Claim: The claim was published on September 17, 2020, and states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero.

Analysis: Given the information provided, it is clear that the claim was made before specific vaccine candidates' temperature requirements were publicly known. Information became available on September 19, 2020, that some leading COVID-19 vaccines needed to be stored at much colder temperatures, such as Pfizer's vaccine candidate requiring -94 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the claim does not specify which vaccines need to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the claim is accurate or not, as it lacks specificity. Nonetheless, considering the information about the temperature requirements for some COVID-19 vaccine candidates, it is plausible that some vaccines need to be shipped at temperatures around -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.

In those instances, the State invoked more familiar provisions of the statutes governing declarations of emergency, including freeing up money earmarked for emergency use; calling on the national guard to help with the effects of the storm; and allowing the police to redirect traffic. But the Governor’s statutory powers during an emergency are broad, flexible, and include the ability to “make such orders.

Title: How many businesses are closing for good and blame Governor Inslee?
Content:
Inslee takes his pay raise and just laughs at the rest of the state as they suffer under his “leadership.” · Governor Inslee has apparently outsourced his decision making to California Governor Newsom and Oregon Governor Brown, because nobody believes he can come up with this stuff on his own (and he didn’t want to be Governor again anyway, which is why he tried to run for President).
This one knows who to blame, and is clearly blaming Washington State Governor Inslee for their demise. It is bad enough that the “emergency” never ends for Governor Inslee and he is enjoying the process of inflicting his brand of pain on the little people of the state.

You just can’t fix stupid; and unfortunately many Washington residents excel in stupidity, as proven by electing this bozo governor twice before. But thanks for playing.

Claim Verification:

The claim, published on December 27, 2020, states that governors in many states, including the author's own state, are closing down businesses again. Given the information presented, it is reasonable to assume that governors do have the authority to close businesses during a state of emergency, as explained in Information 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, Information 4 shows that some business owners in Washington State blame Governor Inslee for their struggles, indicating that businesses have been closed in that state.
