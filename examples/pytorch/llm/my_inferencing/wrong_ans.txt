Christopher Radchenko, MD, UC Health pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist provides insight into how COVID-19 affects the lungs. How does COVID-19 affect the overall respiratory system: short and long term? COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities.
COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person’s immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. It is particularly important that patients who have underlying lung disease can certainly have worsening of those conditions with contraction or exposure to COVID-19.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.
Some chronic heart and blood conditions, diabetes, and obesity may also impact how COVID-19 affects the lungs.

Evidence for the effectiveness of masking on SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level has accumulated, but the additional benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. In this observational study of matched cohorts from 412 US counties between March 21 and October 20, 2020, we estimated the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence.
Subsequently, many states and counties established their own mandates of who should wear masks and when, and how public masking would be enforced. Between April and September 2020, the timing of these masking mandates was highly variable throughout the country. By the fall of 2020, guidance from local health authorities converged so that universal masking in public locations, alongside recommendations for social distancing, had become the norm in most regions. The evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level has been strong1–4 for viruses that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, spread principally through close contact with an infected person.5–9 However, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates beyond public health guidance has been less certain.

Title: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...
Content:
We considered the impact of mandates for mask use targeted only to employees in some work settings, as opposed to communitywide mandates. This evidence is critical, as states and countries worldwide begin to shift to “reopening” their economies and as foot traffic increases. Mandating the public use of masks has become a socially and politically contentious issue, with multiple protests and even acts of violence directed against masked employees and those asking customers to wear face masks.17 Face cover recommendations and mandates are part of the current set of measures, following earlier social distancing measures such as school and nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, and shelter-in-place orders being considered by states and local governments, especially as regions of the country reopen.
The state orders strongly discourage the use of any medical or surgical masks and N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders. The orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).
Exhibit 2 plots the event study estimates of changes in county-level daily COVID-19 growth rates with the employee-only face cover mandates and their 95 percent confidence intervals. All pre- and postmandate estimates were small and insignificant. Overall, these results indicate no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Exhibit 2 Event study estimates of effects of states mandating only employee use of face masks during working time on daily county-level growth rate of COVID-19 cases
Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable. These sixteen jurisdictions also have specific mandates requiring employees in certain professions to wear masks at all times while working.

Fortunately, the scientific evidence points to a reasonable compromise. Because masks work and mandates often don’t, people can make their own decisions. Anybody who wants to wear a snug, high-quality mask can do so and will be less likely to contract Covid. If anything, that approach — one-way masking — is consistent with what hospitals have long done, as Doron, the Tufts epidemiologist, points out.
Mask mandates in schools also seem to have done little to reduce the spread. Hong Kong, despite almost universal mask-wearing, recently endured one of the world’s worst Covid outbreaks. Advocates of mandates sometimes argue that they do have a big effect even if it is not evident in populationwide data, because of how many other factors are at play.
In response, many people are understandably asking what the country can do to minimize the virus’s toll in the weeks ahead. ... So far, a lot of discussion has focused on mask mandates.

Counties with less than 40,000 individuals were excluded because smaller counties tended not to have enough daily infections to analyze. Data were gathered utilizing the US Census Bureau’s 2019 population estimates [15]. Demographic data were also found utilizing the US Census Bureau’s data [16]. The demographic information recorded includes the total estimated population and the average age of the test and control counties.
For reference, the population of HKSAR is approximately 7.45 million people [8]. In another study, there was no risk of transmission from two infected hairstylists and nearly 139 clients, of which the mean age was 52 years old (age range, 21–93 years), and this was attributed to the use of masks [9]. Furthermore, evaluation of 382 sailors (interquartile age range, 24–35 years) on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US navy ship, found that those who took extra precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as mask-wearing, had a 70.0% reduction in transmission when compared to those who did not wear masks [10]. Another study looking at 15 US states (plus Washington, D.C.) with mandated mask requirements found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate [11].

A total of 38 counties were utilized in the study, half with and half without mask mandates. Test counties were followed for 30 days after implementing their mask mandate, and daily new SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded during this timeframe.

The CLAIM states that we know mask mandates work, supported by evidence between counties that have implemented them and those that haven't. To analyze this claim, we need to examine the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 is a study published in JAMA, which focuses on the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence. The study found strong evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level but less certainty about the additional benefit of community-level mask mandates.

Information 2 is a news article that provides an overview of mask mandates in states, cities, and counties in the United States. It does not directly provide evidence for the effectiveness of mask mandates but highlights the widespread implementation of such measures.

Information 3 is a study that examines the impact of community-wide mask mandates on COVID-19 cases. The study found evidence of a decline in daily COVID-19 growth rates with community-wide mask mandates in 16 jurisdictions. However, it also found no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mask mandates.

Information 4 is an opinion piece from The New York Times discussing the effectiveness of masks versus mask mandates. While it acknowledges that masks work, it argues that mask mandates have not always been effective.

Considering the available information, it can be concluded that there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of mask mandates in reducing COVID-19 cases. While Information 4 raises some concerns about the inconsistent effectiveness of mask mandates, the other INFORMATION pieces provide data and studies that demonstrate the positive impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, the CLAIM that we know mask mandates work can be classified as TRUE based on the provided information.

Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington’s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk. Cloth masks are “plenty big to allow for the free flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while still small enough to capture some of the larger respiratory droplets that could contain COVID-19,” Baker said in an email.
While it is true that some N95 masks have exhale valves and do not reduce virus spread very effectively, those recommended for frontline healthcare workers are unvented and are more effective at preventing spread. Baker agreed. “Masks (N95 or other) that have a one way valve, do allow for unfiltered air to be exhaled. For this reason, wearing this mask doesn't protect the people around you. Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for COVID-19.”
Social media posts shared thousands of times in the United States contain multiple false or misleading claims about face masks used to stop the spread of COVID-19, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks “do not filter anything” and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air.

TIME . How “America’s frontline doctors” sold access to bogus COVID-19 treatments—and left patients in the lurch.
In this mixed-methods study of high-use social media platforms, physicians from across the US and representing a range of medical specialties were found to propagate COVID-19 misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and masks on large social media and other online platforms and that many had a wide reach based on number of followers.
Outcome measures included categories of COVID-19 misinformation propagated, the number and traits of physicians engaged in misinformation propagation, and the type of online media channels used to propagate misinformation and potential reach. The propagation of COVID-19 misinformation was attributed to 52 physicians in 28 different specialties across all regions of the country. General misinformation categories included vaccines, medication, masks, and other (ie, conspiracy theories).
Forty-two physicians (80.8%) posted vaccine misinformation, 40 (76.9%) propagated information in more than 1 category, and 20 (38.5%) posted misinformation on 5 or more platforms. Major themes identified included (1) disputing vaccine safety and effectiveness, (2) promoting medical treatments lacking scientific evidence and/or US Food and Drug Administration approval, (3) disputing mask-wearing effectiveness, and (4) other (unsubstantiated claims, eg, virus origin, government lies, and other conspiracy theories).

EVALUATION:

The claim accurately reflects the available information. Throughout the pandemic, there have been multiple instances of misinformation surrounding the use of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Information 1 highlights the debunking of several false or misleading claims about face masks by Dr. Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington's Industrial Hygiene program. She clarified that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk and that masks, including N95 masks, are effective in preventing the spread when used correctly.

Information 2, published by FactCheck.org, discusses the evidence supporting the use of face masks against the coronavirus. It also addresses misleading arguments made by former television journalist Ben Swann, who claimed that face masks have been proven ineffective in stopping the spread of COVID-19. FactCheck.org clarified that the studies Swann cited were not about using masks as source control for the general population.

Information 3 from ABC News highlights various groups and individuals spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Information 4 from CNET debunks eight common COVID-19 face mask myths, further emphasizing the need to counter misinformation about masks.

Lastly, a mixed-methods study mentioned in Information 5 found that physicians across the US and various medical specialties propagated COVID-19 misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and masks on social media platforms. The study identified major themes, including disputing vaccine safety and effectiveness, promoting unproven medical treatments, disputing mask-wearing effectiveness, and other unsubstantiated claims.

In conclusion, the claim that mask misinformation spreads in the US as COVID-19 cases spike is accurate based on the provided information. Numerous instances of misleading claims and the propagation of misinformation by various sources, including physicians, have been documented throughout the pandemic.

Over the 14 days leading up to Mr Morrison's press conference, NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people. Excluding returned travellers, NSW recorded a daily average of 0.91 cases per million, which is again above the threshold for stage 3. Under Victoria's second trigger point, the curfew will not be removed unless there are fewer than a total of 0.75 unexplained cases per million people over 14 days.
These rates can then be applied to case number rates in NSW. For example, under Victoria's roadmap, the state must have a daily average of less than 0.75 cases per million people, over 14 days to reach the third step.

Melbourne University's Dallas English, chair of epidemiology and biostats at the Melbourne School Of Population And Global Health, said "on the numbers" Mr Morrison was right. Professor English said case numbers had been steadily decreasing by an average of 7 per cent per day since the peak on August 5. But he suggested it would be difficult to achieve Victoria's thresholds. "We know NSW has been very successful, but they do have cases bubbling along," he said.

Premier Dominic Perrottet is resisting widespread calls to revert to mask mandates indoors but national cabinet is meeting on Wednesday to discuss the latest COVID-19 crisis, amid speculation masks rules will be reimposed and booster shots expedited. Meanwhile, NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns is isolating at home after one of his staffers contracted the virus. He criticised Mr Perrottet’s refusal to heed the calls from experts and reintroduce mask mandates indoors.
From Tuesday fully vaccinated overseas travellers entering NSW will no longer have to isolate for 72 hours. Overseas arrivals to Sydney will have to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours and isolate at home until they return a negative result. Victoria is considering tightening indoor mask mandates, but will not introduce wholesale restriction changes for Christmas gatherings and major events to stave off an Omicron case spike.
In the absence of Premier Daniel Andrews, Mr Merlino will stand-in as the Victorian representative at Wednesday’s “informal” virtual meeting of national cabinet. There he will join South Australia in calling for the COVID-19 vaccine booster interval to be reduced for a second time, down from five months. “I want it as short as possible,” Mr Merlino said.

To classify the claim accurately, we need to analyze the provided information and determine if COVID-19 case numbers in New South Wales (NSW) were indeed higher than the threshold to lift the curfew in Victoria when Prime Minister Scott Morrison made his statement.

Information 1 and 2 both discuss a fact-checking investigation by RMIT ABC Fact Check, which focuses on comparing NSW's COVID-19 case numbers with Victoria's curfew threshold during the time when Morrison made his claim. According to the data presented in Information 2, over the 14 days leading up to Morrison's press conference, NSW recorded a daily average of 1.1 cases per million people. This is higher than the threshold for stage 3 in Victoria's "roadmap for reopening."

Information 3 and 5 are not directly related to the claim but provide context about the situation in NSW and Victoria during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information 3 discusses Morrison's statement about not going back to lockdowns and the actions taken by NSW and Victoria's leaders. Information 5 provides statistics on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing in NSW.

Given the information from Information 1 and 2, it can be reasonably concluded that the claim is TRUE. During the time when Prime Minister Scott Morrison made his statement, COVID-19 case numbers in NSW were indeed higher than the threshold required to lift the curfew in Victoria.

Content:
A cache of internal emails reveals city officials believed chances were “low” that the festivities would help spread the virus, a prediction that proved tragically off base.

To accurately classify the claim, it is essential to analyze the provided information and understand the context. The claim states that during the coronavirus threat in 2020, there was no suggestion from any doctor, scientist, or political figure to cancel Mardi Gras.

Information 1 supports the claim by mentioning that Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said there were no such suggestions from doctors, scientists, or political figures. This information also provides context about the timing of Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans, which took place between early January and February 25, 2020, when the number of coronavirus cases in the United States was low, and there was no known community spread.

Information 2 and Information 3 do not directly relate to the claim about Mardi Gras. They discuss the spread of misinformation by Joseph Mercola and Robert Malone, respectively, regarding coronavirus vaccines.

Information 4 provides some contrast to the claim. It mentions that New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell blamed President Trump for her decision not to cancel Mardi Gras, which led to a spike in COVID-19 cases in Louisiana. However, this information does not necessarily contradict the claim, as it does not provide evidence of suggestions from doctors, scientists, or political figures to cancel Mardi Gras.

Information 5 is the most relevant piece of information that challenges the claim. It reveals that internal emails from city officials showed they believed the chances of Mardi Gras spreading the virus were low, which turned out to be incorrect. However, this information does not explicitly state that there were suggestions from doctors, scientists, or political figures to cancel the event.

In conclusion, while there is some information that challenges the claim, the majority of the provided data supports it. The Louisiana Governor's statement, backed by the PolitiFact article, is the most direct evidence for the claim. However, it is essential to note that the internal emails from New Orleans officials in Information 5 suggest a lack of awareness or underestimation of the potential risks, which might have led to different decisions being made. Overall, based on the available information, the claim can be classified as mostly TRUE, with the understanding that there might have been an underestimation of the risks involved.

Title: Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 | NEJM
Content:
In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.
In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04381936; ISRCTN number, 50189673.)
Many guidelines for the treatment of such patients have stated that glucocorticoids were either contraindicated or not recommended,18 although in China, glucocorticoids have been recommended for severe cases.19 However, in the first 6 months of the pandemic, practice varied widely across the world: in some series, as many as 50% of patients were treated with glucocorticoids.20,21 Here, we report the results of the controlled, open-label Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
As stated in the protocol, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated when the trial was being planned at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the trial progressed, the trial steering committee, whose members were unaware of the results of the trial comparisons, determined that if 28-day mortality was 20%, then the enrollment of at least 2000 patients in the dexamethasone group and 4000 in the usual care group would provide a power of at least 90% at a two-sided P value of 0.01 to detect a clinically relevant proportional reduction of 20% (an absolute difference of 4 percentage points) between the two groups.

Yes, WHO has prequalified dexamethasone solution for injection. It is produced by 3 manufacturers for use in treating COVID-19 illness. Prequalification means that the drug has been assessed by WHO and deemed safe and effective in treating COVID-19 illness. Do patients receiving corticosteroids need monitoring?
What are corticosteroids and how do they work against COVID-19? Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant qualities that are used to treat a wide range of conditions. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 develop an overstimulation of the immune system, which can be very harmful to their health.
Current evidence comes from the combined results of 8 clinical trials, utilizing data from 7000 patients with low oxygen levels, which show that dexamethasone (or other corticosteroids) reduces COVID-19 deaths. Data from these studies show that deaths are reduced by 20% when patients with severe COVID-19 are given corticosteroid treatment during their illness.

Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Dexamethasone in Hospitalized COVID-19 ...
Content:
We utilized the Premier Health Database to identify hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from July 1, 2020–January 31, 2021. Index date was when patients first initiated oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality for patients receiving dexamethasone versus those not receiving dexamethasone 1-day pre- to 1-day post-index period.
A total of 1,208,881 patients with COVID-19 were screened; as an inpatient 255,216 used oxygen, and 251,536 were included in the analysis. In the dexamethasone group, odds of in-hospital mortality were higher than those of the comparator (FMA: odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.08, 1.22).
Hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen and received dexamethasone did not have a survival benefit versus similar patients not receiving dexamethasone. The dexamethasone group was not associated with favorable responses for outcomes such as progression to death or mechanical ventilation and time to in-hospital death.
In the RECOVERY trial, treatment with dexamethasone demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with COVID-19 disease who required supplemental oxygen at enrollment (death in the dexamethasone arm within 28 days of enrollment: 23.3% vs. standard of care arm: 26.2%; rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.72–0.94) or invasive mechanical ventilation (death in the dexamethasone arm within 28 days of enrollment: 29.3% vs. the standard of care arm: 41.4%; rate ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.81) [10]. After the results from the RECOVERY trial, dexamethasone was recommended as standard of care for patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation [11, 12, 13].

The CLAIM states that a study found dexamethasone improves the survival rates of critical Covid-19 patients. To verify this claim, we can analyze the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 is a news article from the Wall Street Journal, which reports on the University of Oxford's research findings. It confirms that the generic steroid drug dexamethasone significantly reduced deaths in very sick Covid-19 patients in a large clinical trial.

Information 2 is an article from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that presents the results of a controlled, open-label trial comparing various treatments for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The study found that the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization.

Information 3 is a link to an article from the NEJM, which discusses the use of dexamethasone in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. This information supports the findings from Information 2.

Information 4 is from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, which recommends corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. It also mentions that WHO has prequalified dexamethasone solution for injection for use in treating COVID-19 illness.

Information 5 is a study that analyzed the Premier Health Database to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, this study found no survival benefit for patients who received dexamethasone versus those who did not.

Overall, the majority of the information provided supports the CLAIM that dexamethasone improves the survival rates of critical Covid-19 patients. The University of Oxford study, the NEJM article, and the WHO recommendation all confirm this. However, it is important to note that Information 5 presents an opposing result from a different study. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence from the majority of the information supports the accuracy of the CLAIM.

CLAIM: Publication date: 2020-12-14, Content: Media outlets report that a Pfizer vaccine volunteer warns of second dose symptoms.

To analyze the claim, we can expand on the provided information and summarize it as follows:

1. Information 1: Side effects and adverse events related to Pfizer and Novavax vaccines are reported by the Ministry of Health NZ.

2. Information 2: The CDC provides details on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reactions and adverse events. Injection site redness and swelling were reported more frequently after the second dose, while fever was also more common after the second dose compared to the first dose. The majority of local and systemic reactions had a median onset of 1 to 4 days after either dose and lasted for 1 to 2 days.

3. Information 3: The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card reporting system has received rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with both Pfizer and Novavax vaccines. These events are typically mild and individuals recover within a short time with standard treatment and rest. The most common adverse reactions for all COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting, such as fever, fatigue, and injection site pain.

4. Information 4: The FDA added a warning label on mRNA vaccines (including Pfizer) regarding serious but rare cases of heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) in adolescents and young adults, more often occurring after the second dose.

5. Information 5: Health Canada's summary on vaccine safety and side effects mentions that myocarditis or pericarditis after an mRNA vaccine (including Pfizer) usually resolves quickly. The rates of these conditions after the booster dose appear to be lower than after the second dose. Some people with confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis may choose to receive another dose after discussing the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider.

Based on the available information, it can be reasonably concluded that there have been reports of more severe side effects, particularly after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. These side effects include injection site reactions, fever, and in rare cases, heart inflammation. The claim that a Pfizer vaccine volunteer warns of second dose symptoms is, therefore, true, as it aligns with the reported side effects and adverse events associated with the Pfizer vaccine, particularly after the second dose.

Title: Did Trump Suggest Injecting Disinfectant Could Be COVID-19 Treatment?
Content:
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments. "Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines," she said. Other Trump defenders noted that Trump clarified later in the briefing that disinfectants would not, in fact, be administered "through injections," but the "clarification" itself was less than clear.
Bryan's presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces. But when Trump took the podium, he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were "brought inside the body" to fight the virus. Here's the official White House transcript of Trump's remarks (emphasis added): THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
While medical experts and cleaning-supply companies feared Trump's suggestion that disinfectants could be injected as a treatment for COVID-19 could result in people poisoning themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products, some of the president's supporters claimed his remarks were taken out of context. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments.
U.S. President Donald Trump said, with regard to possible medical treatments for COVID-19: "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning."

The CLAIM, published on 2020-04-23, states that President Trump urged people to ingest or inject disinfectants as a treatment for coronavirus. The provided INFORMATION supports this claim.

In INFORMATION 1, published on 2020-04-24, it is reported that Trump suggested research into injecting disinfectants into the body as a potential coronavirus treatment. He also mentioned the possibility of using ultraviolet or powerful light inside the body. This aligns with the CLAIM.

INFORMATION 2, published on the same day, further elaborates on Trump's suggestion of an "injection" of disinfectant into a person infected with the coronavirus. During a briefing, he asked whether heat could kill the virus, which led to the discussion of disinfectants.

INFORMATION 3, published on 2020-04-25, highlights the consequences of Trump's comments. Many people called health hotlines to inquire about using disinfectants to treat the coronavirus, prompting warnings from state agencies.

INFORMATION 4, also published on 2020-04-25, discusses Trump's claim that his comments about injecting disinfectants were meant sarcastically. However, this does not negate the fact that he did suggest the idea during the briefing.

INFORMATION 5, published on 2020-04-24, addresses the controversy surrounding Trump's suggestion. While some defenders claimed his remarks were taken out of context, the official White House transcript shows that Trump did indeed discuss the possibility of bringing light and disinfectants "inside the body" to fight the virus.

In conclusion, based on the available information, the CLAIM that President Trump urged people to ingest or inject disinfectants as a treatment for coronavirus is accurate. Although Trump later claimed his comments were made sarcastically, the provided evidence demonstrates that he did, in fact, suggest the use of disinfectants and light inside the body as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

Title: Reconcile the debate over protective effects of BCG vaccine against ...
Content:
In the 1970s, WHO launched massive immunization programs in developing countries, leading to substantial increase in BCG coverage among 1-year-olds: BCG coverage rate increased from 9% to 80% in African countries, and from 20% to 90% in European countries between 1980 and 201911. Though BCG vaccine was first developed as a prevention for tuberculosis, recent studies have found that BCG vaccine has nonspecific benefits in training the innate immunity through bestowing a type of immunological memory on innate cells12,13,14. This “trained innate immunity” has been shown to be protective against viral infections15,16. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is under debate17,18,19,20.
As targeted COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, researchers have been actively exploring the protective effects of existing vaccines, among which the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) has received much attention following observation of a coincident relationship between severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the level of BCG vaccination in one country8. The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in the 1930s and used to prevent tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the most prevalent diseases in developing countries9,10.
Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36.

Title: Study: TB Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of COVID-19
Content:
A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year.
The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.
While noting that no one believes BCG will be more effective than a specific vaccine for COVID-19, Arditi explained that it could be more quickly approved and made available, given that it has a strong safety profile demonstrated by many years of use. "It is a potentially important bridge that could offer some benefit until we have the most effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines made widely available," he said.
In fact, a number of randomized clinical trials have been launched to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Along with Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Cedars Sinai is a site for the U.S. arm of this ongoing trial, which is recruiting hundreds of healthcare workers.

Title: Frontiers | The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future ...
Content:
BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses.
In addition, since BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (17), it may help to reduce hospitalizations dure to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Here, we review some recent data that addresses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases.
Only ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will provide answers to whether BCG reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 through its cross-protective effects. The phase III randomized clinical trial ACTIVATE (NCT03296423) confirmed that recent vaccination with BCG in elderly (>65 years) protects against new infections.
The study concluded that BCG vaccination is safe, as recently reported by the same group (17), and can protect the elderly against infections. The study also suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, although larger and specific studies are needed to assess BCG protection against COVID-19.

Title: BCG Vaccine Prevents Tuberculosis in Young Children, but Not Adults ...
Content:
When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children. Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries. “The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,” he says.
Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed. “Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.
“Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology. “Our findings indicate that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children.
For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.

The CLAIM states that recent news and media claim that the Tuberculosis vaccine, BCG, may be effective against COVID-19. To analyze the accuracy of this claim, we need to examine the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 discusses the potential protective effects of the BCG vaccine against viral infections through the concept of "trained innate immunity." It also highlights the ongoing debate about the protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 and the need for further evidence.

Information 2 presents a retrospective study that found a correlation between BCG vaccination and lower likelihood of COVID-19 symptoms and antibodies in the blood.

Information 3 reports on a study by Cedars-Sinai that suggests a link between the BCG vaccine and a reduced risk of contracting COVID-19. The study also mentions ongoing clinical trials to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19.

Information 4 discusses the potential benefits of using BCG as a vaccine for COVID-19 in low-and lower-middle-income countries due to its cost-effectiveness and existing infrastructure for its administration. It also explains the cross-protective effects of BCG through trained immunity.

Information 5 focuses on the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in preventing tuberculosis in young children but not adults. The study suggests that BCG vaccination is effective in preventing tuberculosis in young children, although new vaccines are needed due to the limited efficacy of BCG boosters.

Based on the provided information, there is evidence suggesting a potential link between the BCG vaccine and protection against COVID-19. While the effectiveness is still under debate, ongoing studies and clinical trials are being conducted to further investigate this relationship.

The CLAIM, published on 2020-09-17, states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. To analyze the accuracy of this claim, we can refer to the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1, published on 2020-09-19, discusses the challenges of delivering COVID-19 vaccines that may need to be kept at extremely low temperatures.

Information 2, published on 2020-11-03, specifically mentions that some leading COVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna's and Pfizer's, require storage temperatures of -4°F and -94°F (-20°C and -70°C) respectively. This aligns with the claim's assertion about vaccines needing to be stored at extremely low temperatures.

Information 3, although it lacks a publication date, is a duplicate of Information 2. It also discusses the storage requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines, further supporting the claim.

Information 4, also without a publication date, provides storage best practices for frozen vaccines in Fahrenheit. While it doesn't directly address the claim, it reinforces the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling.

Information 5, again without a publication date, discusses the various cold chains for vaccines, including the ultralow chain at -70°C, the frozen chain at -20°C, and the refrigerated chain between 2°C and 8°C. It highlights that only a few vaccines require freezing to -20°C, while some animal vaccines are kept ultracold. This information indirectly supports the claim by illustrating the existence of vaccines that require storage at extremely low temperatures.

In conclusion, based on the available information, the claim that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero is accurate. The provided INFORMATION, particularly Information 2 and Information 3, directly discusses the storage requirements for leading COVID-19 vaccines, which need to be stored at extremely low temperatures, including -70°C.

Title: Coronavirus: Outcry after Trump suggests injecting disinfectant ...
Content:
Top US doctor says heat and light are not a treatment for Covid-19 · US President Donald Trump has been lambasted by the medical community after suggesting research into whether coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body. He also appeared to propose irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing. Another of his officials had moments earlier said sunlight and disinfectant were known to kill the infection.
Kashif Mahmood, a doctor in Charleston, West Virginia, tweeted: "As a physician, I can't recommend injecting disinfectant into the lungs or using UV radiation inside the body to treat Covid-19. ... John Balmes, a pulmonologist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, warned that even breathing fumes from bleach could cause severe health problems. He told Bloomberg News: "Inhaling chlorine bleach would be absolutely the worst thing for the lungs. The airway and lungs are not made to be exposed to even an aerosol of disinfectant.
Doctors call the president's latest remarks about coronavirus treatment "dangerous" and "ridiculous".

Other doctors stepped forward after the briefing to challenge the president, calling his comments “irresponsible,” “extremely dangerous” and “frightening” in interviews with The Post as they rushed to warn people of the dire consequences of ingesting caustic chemicals.
As Bryan left the lectern without answering reporters’ questions, Trump stepped up to the microphone. Before he allowed anyone to ask a question, the president offered an answer to a “question that, probably, some of you are thinking of if you are totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting.” · That is when he asked about injecting an unspecified disinfectant into the lungs of covid-19 patients. He also raised the possibility of using light to combat the viral infection and suggested consulting medical doctors with these questions.
Instead of talking about disinfectant the president should be talking about how he’s going to implement testing, which every expert says is the quickest path to get us moving again.” · Meanwhile, experts also sought to fact-check Trump’s claims about light as a possible treatment. “No, you cannot inject UV light into your body to cure #COVID19 — neither biology or physics work that way,” tweeted science writer David Robert Grimes, who noted that he earned his PhD in medical ultraviolet radiation.

Content:
The president first posed the question April 23 after William Bryan, undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, presented a study that found sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach have an adverse effect on the coronavirus. Bryan was referring to the use of disinfectants on surfaces and in aerosols, but Trump asked whether the chemicals could be used in a potential COVID-19 treatment, as well.
Bryan was referring to the use of disinfectants on surfaces and in aerosols, but Trump asked whether the chemicals could be used in a potential COVID-19 treatment, as well. Some websites and social media users took that question to mean the president was recommending people inject themselves with bleach or isopropyl alcohol, an ingredient in hand sanitizer. But others said Trump meant something very different — that doctors could investigate whether using sunlight or disinfectants could clear the virus in patients.
President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on April 23, 2020, in Washington. (AP) ... During a coronavirus press briefing, President Trump floated the idea of using disinfectants and sunlight to treat COVID-19 patients.
During a coronavirus press briefing, President Trump floated the idea of using disinfectants and sunlight to treat COVID-19 patients.  · Trump has since walked back those remarks, and several websites and social media posts have taken them out of context. The briefing transcript shows that Trump did not say people should inject themselves with bleach or alcohol to treat the coronavirus. He was asking officials on the White House coronavirus task force whether they could be used in potential cures. President Donald Trump is walking back what he said during an April 23 coronavirus press briefing about using disinfectants to treat COVID-19 patients.

The CLAIM states that on April 23, 2020, US President Donald Trump suggested studying the injection of disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19.

Relevant information supports this claim. On April 24, 2020, a news article reported that Trump indeed proposed the possibility of an "injection" of disinfectant into a person infected with the coronavirus during a daily briefing. The Lysol maker issued a warning against internal use of their cleaning products, and Trump had previously touted unproven treatments during these briefings.

On April 24, 2020, another news article highlighted the outcry after Trump's suggestion to inject disinfectant into the body as a treatment for COVID-19. The president also mentioned irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing. A Homeland Security official stated that federal laboratories were not considering such a treatment option.

Doctors criticized Trump's comments as "dangerous" and "ridiculous." In the briefing, Trump asked Dr. Deborah Birx about using UV light or heat as potential treatments for COVID-19, to which she responded that they were not being used as treatments. Trump's comments led to warnings from doctors about the severe health risks associated with inhaling fumes from bleach or ingesting disinfectants.

The CLAIM is accurate, as it aligns with the information provided. Trump did indeed suggest studying the injection of disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19 during a press briefing on April 23, 2020. However, it is essential to note that Trump later walked back these remarks, and his intentions were to investigate potential cures rather than recommending self-treatment with disinfectants.

Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.

The CLAIM states that in the author's state, as well as many others, governors are closing down businesses again. To analyze the claim's accuracy, we can refer to the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 discusses the legal authority of state and local governments to close businesses and impose restrictions during emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights that governors have the power to enforce such measures based on existing laws and emergency management statutes.

Information 2 addresses a false claim that governors do not have the authority to close businesses. It explains that the National Governors Association defines governors' responsibility for emergency preparedness and that many state governors had declared states of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Information 3 provides context on how governors' actions during emergencies are restricted by laws and enactments. They can only take actions that comply with the legislative statutes, which pre-authorize specific emergency measures.

Information 4 provides an anecdote of a business blaming Washington State Governor Inslee for its closure, suggesting that some governors have indeed closed businesses in their states.

Information 5, published by the National Governors Association, highlights the role of governors in protecting public health and stimulating economic recovery during the pandemic. It also mentions the association's efforts to connect governors and share guidance to address challenges in their respective states.

Based on the provided information, it can be reasonably concluded that the CLAIM is TRUE. Governors in many states have the legal authority to close businesses during emergencies, and some have indeed taken such measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to hospitalization or death. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, over six million people have been hospitalized and over one million have died from COVID-19.
COVID-19 most commonly spreads through the air when a person with COVID-19 breathes out small particles and respiratory droplets and other people around them breathe them in. Respiratory droplets can also get on surfaces and be spread through touch. COVID-19 can be spread even when a person does not have symptoms.

People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure. Patients with severe problems breathing due to COVID-19 may require oxygen therapy, a ventilator, or other airway support. People with chronic lung conditions have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the cells along the airways. It invades the cells in part by attaching to a specific cell receptor, called ACE-2, found on each cell. The virus uses ACE-2 as a doorway into the cell. The virus then takes over the cell’s ability to make copies of itself, and instead produces more copies of the virus to infect other cells. Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure.

Evidence for the effectiveness of masking on SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the individual level has accumulated, but the additional benefit of community-level mandates is less certain. In this observational study of matched cohorts from 412 US counties between March 21 and October 20, 2020, we estimated the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence.
Subsequently, many states and counties established their own mandates of who should wear masks and when, and how public masking would be enforced. Between April and September 2020, the timing of these masking mandates was highly variable throughout the country. By the fall of 2020, guidance from local health authorities converged so that universal masking in public locations, alongside recommendations for social distancing, had become the norm in most regions. The evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level has been strong1–4 for viruses that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, spread principally through close contact with an infected person.5–9 However, the incremental benefit of community-level mandates beyond public health guidance has been less certain.

Content:
We considered the impact of mandates for mask use targeted only to employees in some work settings, as opposed to communitywide mandates. This evidence is critical, as states and countries worldwide begin to shift to “reopening” their economies and as foot traffic increases. Mandating the public use of masks has become a socially and politically contentious issue, with multiple protests and even acts of violence directed against masked employees and those asking customers to wear face masks.17 Face cover recommendations and mandates are part of the current set of measures, following earlier social distancing measures such as school and nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, and shelter-in-place orders being considered by states and local governments, especially as regions of the country reopen.
The state orders strongly discourage the use of any medical or surgical masks and N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders. The orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).
Exhibit 2 plots the event study estimates of changes in county-level daily COVID-19 growth rates with the employee-only face cover mandates and their 95 percent confidence intervals. All pre- and postmandate estimates were small and insignificant. Overall, these results indicate no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mandates. Exhibit 2 Event study estimates of effects of states mandating only employee use of face masks during working time on daily county-level growth rate of COVID-19 cases
Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable. These sixteen jurisdictions also have specific mandates requiring employees in certain professions to wear masks at all times while working.

Fortunately, the scientific evidence points to a reasonable compromise. Because masks work and mandates often don’t, people can make their own decisions.

Mask mandates in schools also seem to have done little to reduce the spread. Hong Kong, despite almost universal mask-wearing, recently endured one of the world’s worst Covid outbreaks. Advocates of mandates sometimes argue that they do have a big effect even if it is not evident in populationwide data, because of how many other factors are at play.
In response, many people are understandably asking what the country can do to minimize the virus’s toll in the weeks ahead. ... So far, a lot of discussion has focused on mask mandates.

Counties with less than 40,000 individuals were excluded because smaller counties tended not to have enough daily infections to analyze. Data were gathered utilizing the US Census Bureau’s 2019 population estimates [15]. Demographic data were also found utilizing the US Census Bureau’s data [16]. The demographic information recorded includes the total estimated population and the average age of the test and control counties.
For reference, the population of HKSAR is approximately 7.45 million people [8]. In another study, there was no risk of transmission from two infected hairstylists and nearly 139 clients, of which the mean age was 52 years old (age range, 21–93 years), and this was attributed to the use of masks [9]. Furthermore, evaluation of 382 sailors (interquartile age range, 24–35 years) on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US navy ship, found that those who took extra precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as mask-wearing, had a 70.0% reduction in transmission when compared to those who did not wear masks [10]. Another study looking at 15 US states (plus Washington, D.C.) with mandated mask requirements found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate [11]. In Bangladesh, villages that adopted masking as a preventative measure against COVID-19 found an 11.2% overall risk reduction and a 34.7% risk reduction for people older than 60 y

Community use of face masks and COVID-19: evidence from a natural experiment of state mandates in the US.
The counties studied were those with populations between 40,000 and 105,000 in states that did not have statewide mask mandates. A total of 38 counties were utilized in the study, half with and half without mask mandates. Test counties were followed for 30 days after implementing their mask mandate, and daily new SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded during this timeframe.

The CLAIM states that we know mask mandates work, supported by evidence between counties that have implemented them and those that haven't. To analyze this claim, we need to examine the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 is a study published in JAMA, which focuses on the association between county-level public masking mandates and daily COVID-19 case incidence. The study found strong evidence for the effectiveness of masking at the individual level but less certainty about the additional benefit of community-level mask mandates.

Information 2 is a news article that provides an overview of mask mandates in states, cities, and counties in the United States. It does not directly provide evidence for the effectiveness of mask mandates but highlights the widespread implementation of such measures.

Information 3 is a study that examines the impact of community-wide mask mandates on COVID-19 cases. The study found evidence of a decline in daily COVID-19 growth rates with community-wide mask mandates in 16 jurisdictions. However, it also found no evidence of declines in daily COVID-19 growth rates with employee-only mask mandates.

Information 4 is an opinion piece from The New York Times discussing the effectiveness of masks versus mask mandates. While it acknowledges that masks work, it argues that mask mandates have not always been effective.

Information 5 is a study that evaluates the effectiveness of countywide mask mandates in reducing COVID-19 cases. The study found a 2.0% decline in the daily SARS-CoV-2 growth rate after 21 days of having passed the mask mandate in 15 US states and Washington, D.C.

Considering the available information, it can be concluded that there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of mask mandates in reducing COVID-19 cases. While Information 4 raises some concerns about the inconsistent effectiveness of mask mandates, the other INFORMATION pieces provide data and studies that demonstrate the positive impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, the CLAIM that we know mask mandates work can be classified as TRUE based on the provided information.

Dr. Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington’s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk.
Marissa Baker, director of the University of Washington’s Industrial Hygiene program, confirmed that masks worn in the workplace to slow the spread of COVID-19 should not pose an oxygen deficiency risk. Cloth masks are “plenty big to allow for the free flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while still small enough to capture some of the larger respiratory droplets that could contain COVID-19,” Baker said in an email.
While it is true that some N95 masks have exhale valves and do not reduce virus spread very effectively, those recommended for frontline healthcare workers are unvented and are more effective at preventing spread. Baker agreed. “Masks (N95 or other) that have a one way valve, do allow for unfiltered air to be exhaled. For this reason, wearing this mask doesn't protect the people around you. Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for COVID-19.”
Social media posts shared thousands of times in the United States contain multiple false or misleading claims about face masks used to stop the spread of COVID-19, including that they violate federal standards for oxygen supply, cloth masks “do not filter anything” and trap carbon dioxide, surgical masks spread germs, and N95 masks expel unfiltered air.

TIME . How “America’s frontline doctors” sold access to bogus COVID-19 treatments—and left patients in the lurch.
In this mixed-methods study of high-use social media platforms, physicians from across the US and representing a range of medical specialties were found to propagate COVID-19 misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and masks on large social media and other online platforms and that many had a wide reach based on number of followers.
Outcome measures included categories of COVID-19 misinformation propagated, the number and traits of physicians engaged in misinformation propagation, and the type of online media channels used to propagate misinformation and potential reach. The propagation of COVID-19 misinformation was attributed to 52 physicians in 28 different specialties across all regions of the country. General misinformation categories included vaccines, medication, masks, and other (ie, conspiracy theories).
Forty-two physicians (80.8%) posted vaccine misinformation, 40 (76.9%) propagated information in more than 1 category, and 20 (38.5%) posted misinformation on 5 or more platforms. Major themes identified included (1) disputing vaccine safety and effectiveness, (2) promoting medical treatments lacking scientific evidence and/or US Food and Drug Administration approval, (3) disputing mask-wearing effectiveness, and (4) other (unsubstantiated claims, eg, virus origin, government lies, and other conspiracy theories). In this mixed-methods study of US physician propagation of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, results suggest widespread, inaccurate, and potentially harmful assertions made by physicians across the country who represented a range of subspecialties.

CLAIM: COVID-19 is a man-made virus intentionally manufactured in a lab and released to the public. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Scientists say the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 rules out the possibility that the virus was created in a lab. THE FACTS: A draft study associated with a group founded by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is giving new life to social media claims that the coronavirus was manufactured intentionally in a Chinese lab.
Scientists have repeatedly said that the genetic sequence of the virus and its similarities to SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, prove that the virus was not made in a lab or engineered. In a paper titled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” published in Nature in March, scientists with Scripps Research who studied the genome sequence of the virus concluded that it originated through natural processes. By looking at the virus’s molecular structure, they were able to determine that the backbone of the virus differed from coronaviruses already known to scientists and rather it resembled viruses found in bats and pangolins.

Conspiracy theorists have suggested that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is manmade, leaked from the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory that is in the area where the pandemic originated. Researchers with Scripps Research and other institutions around the globe published a study in the journal Nature Medicine debunking the theory after an analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. “By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,” said Kristian Andersen, associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps and corresponding author of the study.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, their research showed that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone was quite different from known coronaviruses and more closely resembled viruses found in bats and pangolins. “These two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Andersen said.
Typically, if a researcher was engineering a new coronavirus as a pathogen or biological warfare agent, they build it on the backbone of a virus that is already identified as causing disease.

As of March 18, there are 201,530 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 8,007 total deaths, and 82,034 recoveries. SARS-CoV-2 is from the coronavirus family.

The claim states that a study shows the new coronavirus was not man-made. Information 1, published on the same date as the claim, supports this claim by explaining that the mutations in the virus's receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its distinct backbone rule out laboratory manipulation as its origin. This conclusion was drawn by comparing the genome sequence data of known coronavirus strains. The study suggests that the virus likely originated through natural processes involving viruses found in bats and pangolins.

Information 2, from an AP News article, also debunks claims that the coronavirus was intentionally manufactured in a lab. Scientists have repeatedly stated that the virus's molecular structure and similarities to SARS prove it was not created in a lab or engineered.

Information 3 further supports the claim by reporting on a comparative genomic study that found the COVID-19 virus evolved from naturally occurring strains. Information 4 discusses how virologists have debunked a new study claiming the virus was man-made, emphasizing that vaccines already in human studies have shown the ability to trigger an immune system response.

(Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04381936; ISRCTN number, 50189673.)
Many guidelines for the treatment of such patients have stated that glucocorticoids were either contraindicated or not recommended,18 although in China, glucocorticoids have been recommended for severe cases.19 However, in the first 6 months of the pandemic, practice varied widely across the world: in some series, as many as 50% of patients were treated with glucocorticoids.20,21 Here, we report the results of the controlled, open-label Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
As stated in the protocol, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated when the trial was being planned at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the trial progressed, the trial steering committee, whose members were unaware of the results of the trial comparisons, determined that if 28-day mortality was 20%, then the enrollment of at least 2000 patients in the dexamethasone group and 4000 in the usual care group would provide a power of at least 90% at a two-sided P value of 0.01 to detect a clinically relevant proportional reduction of 20% (an absolute difference of 4 percentage points) between the two groups.

Yes, WHO has prequalified dexamethasone solution for injection. It is produced by 3 manufacturers for use in treating COVID-19 illness. Prequalification means that the drug has been assessed by WHO and deemed safe and effective in treating COVID-19 illness. Do patients receiving corticosteroids need monitoring?
What are corticosteroids and how do they work against COVID-19? Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant qualities that are used to treat a wide range of conditions. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 develop an overstimulation of the immune system, which can be very harmful to their health.
Current evidence comes from the combined results of 8 clinical trials, utilizing data from 7000 patients with low oxygen levels, which show that dexamethasone (or other corticosteroids) reduces COVID-19 deaths. Data from these studies show that deaths are reduced by 20% when patients with severe COVID-19 are given corticosteroid treatment during their illness.

Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Dexamethasone in Hospitalized COVID-19 ...
Content:
We utilized the Premier Health Database to identify hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from July 1, 2020–January 31, 2021. Index date was when patients first initiated oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality for patients receiving dexamethasone versus those not receiving dexamethasone 1-day pre- to 1-day post-index period.
A total of 1,208,881 patients with COVID-19 were screened; as an inpatient 255,216 used oxygen, and 251,536 were included in the analysis. In the dexamethasone group, odds of in-hospital mortality were higher than those of the comparator (FMA: odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.08, 1.22).
Hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen and received dexamethasone did not have a survival benefit versus similar patients not receiving dexamethasone. The dexamethasone group was not associated with favorable responses for outcomes such as progression to death or mechanical ventilation and time to in-hospital death.
In the RECOVERY trial, treatment with dexamethasone demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with COVID-19 disease who required supplemental oxygen at enrollment (death in the dexamethasone arm within 28 days of enrollment: 23.3% vs. standard of care arm: 26.2%; rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.72–0.94) or invasive mechanical ventilation (death in the dexamethasone arm within 28 days of enrollment: 29.3% vs. the standard of care arm: 41.4%; rate ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.81) [10]. After the results from the RECOVERY trial, dexamethasone was recommended as standard of care for patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation [11, 12, 13].

The CLAIM states that a study found dexamethasone improves the survival rates of critical Covid-19 patients. To verify this claim, we can analyze the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 is a news article from the Wall Street Journal, which reports on the University of Oxford's research findings. It confirms that the generic steroid drug dexamethasone significantly reduced deaths in very sick Covid-19 patients in a large clinical trial.

Information 2 is an article from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that presents the results of a controlled, open-label trial comparing various treatments for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The study found that the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization.

Information 3 is a link to an article from the NEJM, which discusses the use of dexamethasone in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. This information supports the findings from Information 2.

Information 4 is from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, which recommends corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. It also mentions that WHO has prequalified dexamethasone solution for injection for use in treating COVID-19 illness.

Information 5 is a study that analyzed the Premier Health Database to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, this study found no survival benefit for patients who received dexamethasone versus those who did not.

Overall, the majority of the information provided supports the CLAIM that dexamethasone improves the survival rates of critical Covid-19 patients. The University of Oxford study, the NEJM article, and the WHO recommendation all confirm this. However, it is important to note that Information 5 presents an opposing result from a different study. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence from the majority of the information supports the accuracy of the CLAIM.

CLAIM: Publication date: 2020-12-14, Content: Media outlets report that a Pfizer vaccine volunteer warns of second dose symptoms.

To analyze the claim, we can expand on the provided information and summarize it as follows:

1. Information 1: Side effects and adverse events related to Pfizer and Novavax vaccines are reported by the Ministry of Health NZ.

2. Information 2: The CDC provides details on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reactions and adverse events. Injection site redness and swelling were reported more frequently after the second dose, while fever was also more common after the second dose compared to the first dose. The majority of local and systemic reactions had a median onset of 1 to 4 days after either dose and lasted for 1 to 2 days.

3. Information 3: The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card reporting system has received rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with both Pfizer and Novavax vaccines. These events are typically mild and individuals recover within a short time with standard treatment and rest. The most common adverse reactions for all COVID-19 vaccines were mild and self-limiting, such as fever, fatigue, and injection site pain.

4. Information 4: The FDA added a warning label on mRNA vaccines (including Pfizer) regarding serious but rare cases of heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) in adolescents and young adults, more often occurring after the second dose.

5. Information 5: Health Canada's summary on vaccine safety and side effects mentions that myocarditis or pericarditis after an mRNA vaccine (including Pfizer) usually resolves quickly. The rates of these conditions after the booster dose appear to be lower than after the second dose. Some people with confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis may choose to receive another dose after discussing the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider.

Based on the available information, it can be reasonably concluded that there have been reports of more severe side effects, particularly after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. These side effects include injection site reactions, fever, and in rare cases, heart inflammation. The claim that a Pfizer vaccine volunteer warns of second dose symptoms is, therefore, true, as it aligns with the reported side effects and adverse events associated with the Pfizer vaccine, particularly after the second dose.

Mr Trump has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxycloroquine, as a possible treatment for coronavirus, though he has stopped touting that drug recently. This week a study of coronavirus patients in a US government-run hospital for military veterans found more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than those treated with standard care. Reacting to the president's remarks on Thursday evening, Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger in November's White House election, tweeted: "UV light?

"Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines," she said. Other Trump defenders noted that Trump clarified later in the briefing that disinfectants would not, in fact, be administered "through injections," but the "clarification" itself was less than clear.
Bryan's presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces. But when Trump took the podium, he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were "brought inside the body" to fight the virus. Here's the official White House transcript of Trump's remarks (emphasis added): THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
While medical experts and cleaning-supply companies feared Trump's suggestion that disinfectants could be injected as a treatment for COVID-19 could result in people poisoning themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products, some of the president's supporters claimed his remarks were taken out of context. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments.
U.S. President Donald Trump said, with regard to possible medical treatments for COVID-19: "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning."

The CLAIM, published on 2020-04-23, states that President Trump urged people to ingest or inject disinfectants as a treatment for coronavirus. The provided INFORMATION supports this claim.

In INFORMATION 1, published on 2020-04-24, it is reported that Trump suggested research into injecting disinfectants into the body as a potential coronavirus treatment. He also mentioned the possibility of using ultraviolet or powerful light inside the body. This aligns with the CLAIM.

INFORMATION 2, published on the same day, further elaborates on Trump's suggestion of an "injection" of disinfectant into a person infected with the coronavirus. During a briefing, he asked whether heat could kill the virus, which led to the discussion of disinfectants.

INFORMATION 3, published on 2020-04-25, highlights the consequences of Trump's comments. Many people called health hotlines to inquire about using disinfectants to treat the coronavirus, prompting warnings from state agencies.

INFORMATION 4, also published on 2020-04-25, discusses Trump's claim that his comments about injecting disinfectants were meant sarcastically. However, this does not negate the fact that he did suggest the idea during the briefing.

INFORMATION 5, published on 2020-04-24, addresses the controversy surrounding Trump's suggestion. While some defenders claimed his remarks were taken out of context, the official White House transcript shows that Trump did indeed discuss the possibility of bringing light and disinfectants "inside the body" to fight the virus.

In conclusion, based on the available information, the CLAIM that President Trump urged people to ingest or inject disinfectants as a treatment for coronavirus is accurate. Although Trump later claimed his comments were made sarcastically, the provided evidence demonstrates that he did, in fact, suggest the use of disinfectants and light inside the body as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

Title: Reconcile the debate over protective effects of BCG vaccine against ...
Content:
In the 1970s, WHO launched massive immunization programs in developing countries, leading to substantial increase in BCG coverage among 1-year-olds: BCG coverage rate increased from 9% to 80% in African countries, and from 20% to 90% in European countries between 1980 and 201911. Though BCG vaccine was first developed as a prevention for tuberculosis, recent studies have found that BCG vaccine has nonspecific benefits in training the innate immunity through bestowing a type of immunological memory on innate cells12,13,14. This “trained innate immunity” has been shown to be protective against viral infections15,16. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is under debate17,18,19,20.
As targeted COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, researchers have been actively exploring the protective effects of existing vaccines, among which the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) has received much attention following observation of a coincident relationship between severity of COVID-19 outbreaks and the level of BCG vaccination in one country8. The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in the 1930s and used to prevent tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the most prevalent diseases in developing countries9,10.
Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36.

Title: Study: TB Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of COVID-19

A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease. The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year.
The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.
While noting that no one believes BCG will be more effective than a specific vaccine for COVID-19, Arditi explained that it could be more quickly approved and made available, given that it has a strong safety profile demonstrated by many years of use. "It is a potentially important bridge that could offer some benefit until we have the most effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines made widely available," he said.
In fact, a number of randomized clinical trials have been launched to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Along with Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Cedars Sinai is a site for the U.S. arm of this ongoing trial, which is recruiting hundreds of healthcare workers.

Title: Frontiers | The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future ...
Content:
BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses.
In addition, since BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (17), it may help to reduce hospitalizations dure to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Here, we review some recent data that addresses the potential use of BCG to diminish the magnitude of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory diseases.
Only ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will provide answers to whether BCG reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 through its cross-protective effects. The phase III randomized clinical trial ACTIVATE (NCT03296423) confirmed that recent vaccination with BCG in elderly (>65 years) protects against new infections.
The study concluded that BCG vaccination is safe, as recently reported by the same group (17), and can protect the elderly against infections. The study also suggests that BCG vaccination may be able to protect health workers or vulnerable individuals against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, although larger and specific studies are needed to assess BCG protection against COVID-19.

Title: BCG Vaccine Prevents Tuberculosis in Young Children, but Not Adults ...
Content:
When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children. Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries. “The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,” he says.
Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed. “Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine’s effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,” says study lead author Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.

For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.

The CLAIM states that recent news and media claim that the Tuberculosis vaccine, BCG, may be effective against COVID-19. To analyze the accuracy of this claim, we need to examine the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1 discusses the potential protective effects of the BCG vaccine against viral infections through the concept of "trained innate immunity." It also highlights the ongoing debate about the protective effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 and the need for further evidence.

Information 2 presents a retrospective study that found a correlation between BCG vaccination and lower likelihood of COVID-19 symptoms and antibodies in the blood.

Information 3 reports on a study by Cedars-Sinai that suggests a link between the BCG vaccine and a reduced risk of contracting COVID-19. The study also mentions ongoing clinical trials to study the potential protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19.

Information 4 discusses the potential benefits of using BCG as a vaccine for COVID-19 in low-and lower-middle-income countries due to its cost-effectiveness and existing infrastructure for its administration. It also explains the cross-protective effects of BCG through trained immunity.

Information 5 focuses on the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in preventing tuberculosis in young children but not adults. The study suggests that BCG vaccination is effective in preventing tuberculosis in young children, although new vaccines are needed due to the limited efficacy of BCG boosters.

Based on the provided information, there is evidence suggesting a potential link between the BCG vaccine and protection against COVID-19. While the effectiveness is still under debate, ongoing studies and clinical trials are being conducted to further investigate this relationship. Therefore, the CLAIM can be classified as TRUE, as it aligns with the information provided. However, it is important to note that the knowledge and evidence presented here are specific to the given INFORMATION and may not represent the entirety of the current research on this topic.

Traditional vaccines are usually stored between 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but some of the leading COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperatures. Moderna’s vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas Pfizer’s vaccine candidate requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typical restaurant freezers have a range of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit and simply can’t reach the temperatures required by something like the Pfizer vaccine.

The CLAIM, published on 2020-09-17, states that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero. To analyze the accuracy of this claim, we can refer to the provided INFORMATION.

Information 1, published on 2020-09-19, discusses the challenges of delivering COVID-19 vaccines that may need to be kept at extremely low temperatures.

Information 2, published on 2020-11-03, specifically mentions that some leading COVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna's and Pfizer's, require storage temperatures of -4°F and -94°F (-20°C and -70°C) respectively. This aligns with the claim's assertion about vaccines needing to be stored at extremely low temperatures.

Information 3, although it lacks a publication date, is a duplicate of Information 2. It also discusses the storage requirements for Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines, further supporting the claim.

Information 4, also without a publication date, provides storage best practices for frozen vaccines in Fahrenheit. While it doesn't directly address the claim, it reinforces the importance of proper vaccine storage and handling.

Information 5, again without a publication date, discusses the various cold chains for vaccines, including the ultralow chain at -70°C, the frozen chain at -20°C, and the refrigerated chain between 2°C and 8°C. It highlights that only a few vaccines require freezing to -20°C, while some animal vaccines are kept ultracold. This information indirectly supports the claim by illustrating the existence of vaccines that require storage at extremely low temperatures.

In conclusion, based on the available information, the claim that some vaccines have to be shipped at 70 degrees below zero is accurate. The provided INFORMATION, particularly Information 2 and Information 3, directly discusses the storage requirements for leading COVID-19 vaccines, which need to be stored at extremely low temperatures, including -70°C.

Bryan was referring to the use of disinfectants on surfaces and in aerosols, but Trump asked whether the chemicals could be used in a potential COVID-19 treatment, as well. Some websites and social media users took that question to mean the president was recommending people inject themselves with bleach or isopropyl alcohol, an ingredient in hand sanitizer. But others said Trump meant something very different — that doctors could investigate whether using sunlight or disinfectants could clear the virus in patients.

During a coronavirus press briefing, President Trump floated the idea of using disinfectants and sunlight to treat COVID-19 patients.  · Trump has since walked back those remarks, and several websites and social media posts have taken them out of context. The briefing transcript shows that Trump did not say people should inject themselves with bleach or alcohol to treat the coronavirus. He was asking officials on the White House coronavirus task force whether they could be used in potential cures. President Donald Trump is walking back what he said during an April 23 coronavirus press briefing about using disinfectants to treat COVID-19 patients.

The CLAIM states that on April 23, 2020, US President Donald Trump suggested studying the injection of disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19.

Relevant information supports this claim. On April 24, 2020, a news article reported that Trump indeed proposed the possibility of an "injection" of disinfectant into a person infected with the coronavirus during a daily briefing. The Lysol maker issued a warning against internal use of their cleaning products, and Trump had previously touted unproven treatments during these briefings.

On April 24, 2020, another news article highlighted the outcry after Trump's suggestion to inject disinfectant into the body as a treatment for COVID-19. The president also mentioned irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing. A Homeland Security official stated that federal laboratories were not considering such a treatment option.

Doctors criticized Trump's comments as "dangerous" and "ridiculous." In the briefing, Trump asked Dr. Deborah Birx about using UV light or heat as potential treatments for COVID-19, to which she responded that they were not being used as treatments. Trump's comments led to warnings from doctors about the severe health risks associated with inhaling fumes from bleach or ingesting disinfectants.

The CLAIM is accurate, as it aligns with the information provided. Trump did indeed suggest studying the injection of disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19 during a press briefing on April 23, 2020. However, it is essential to note that Trump later walked back these remarks, and his intentions were to investigate potential cures rather than recommending self-treatment with disinfectants.

Content:
Unlike the famous Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott “declaring” bankruptcy in a building parking lot, when Governor Murphy declared a state of emergency in New Jersey he did not simply open the window of his office, shout “this is an emergency!” and then start issuing a list of edicts. His authority, and that of any executive, is restricted by the laws authorizing such a declaration. To prevent abuse, the power to make laws, enforce laws, and interpret laws are separated into three branches, i.e., the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people.
That means the governor cannot simply do what he wants (like a king or dictator), even if he feels those actions are best for the people. He must do only those things which comply with the laws enacted by the legislature (as interpreted by judges). So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments.
So upon declaring a state of emergency, Governor Murphy—and any other executive declaring an emergency—issued a series of executive orders invoking specific New Jersey legislative enactments. Those statutes pre-authorized the executive branch (which the Governor heads) to take certain, specific actions when the state is facing an emergency.
In those instances, the State invoked more familiar provisions of the statutes governing declarations of emergency, including freeing up money earmarked for emergency use; calling on the national guard to help with the effects of the storm; and allowing the police to redirect traffic. But the Governor’s statutory powers during an emergency are broad, flexible, and include the ability to “make such orders.
