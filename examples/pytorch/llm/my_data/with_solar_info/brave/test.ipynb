Yeadon, who had not worked with vaccines, then left Pfizer and with three colleagues founded the biotechnology company Ziarco, for which he served as CEO and which was sold to Novartis for $325 million in 2017. Yeadon falsely claimed in an October 2020 blog post that the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom was \"effectively over\".\\nThe Times has described him as \"a hero of Covid conspiracy theorists\" and \"a key figure in the antivax movement\". Until 2011, he served as the chief scientist and vice-president of the allergy and respiratory research division of the drug company Pfizer, and is the co-founder and former CEO of the biotechnology company Ziarco. Yeadon received his PhD under Ian Kitchen at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK. His thesis was on the respiratory system of rats. Yeadon worked with Salvador Moncada at the Wellcome Research Laboratories, focusing on airway hyper-responsiveness and the effects of pollutants such as Ozone and Nitrogen oxide, as well as working on drug discovery of 5-LO and COX.\\nHe has contributed funding to Liberty Places, a group promising to build a community on the African archipelago of Zanzibar for Europeans to escape COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine mandates.

SOURCE: Julia Hartley-Brewer, Michael Yeadon, talkRADIO, 5 Nov. 2020  ... Inaccurate: Between September and early November 2020, there was a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.K, and this trend will likely persist for some time. The claim that “the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” is false.\\nYeadon: “I am saying the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” · The suggestion that COVID-19 PCR testing produces false positives as a result of “cross-reacting” and detecting common cold coronaviruses is unsupported. As this previous Health Feedback review explained, the PCR test for COVID-19 is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and does not detect coronaviruses that cause the common cold. Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is “over in the U.K.” is contradicted by data from both the U.K. government and Our World in Data showing that there is a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.K., going from below 5,000 in September to about 25,000 in November (Figure 2).\\nInformation 5:\\nPublication date: 2021-03-18\\nTitle: SPECIAL REPORT The ex-Pfizer scientist who became an anti-vax hero ...\\nContent:\\nIn January, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a non-profit organization, found that 13% of unvaccinated people in the United States had heard that \"COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility.\" What gave the debunked claim credibility was that one of the petition\\'s co-authors, Michael Yeadon, wasn\\'t just any scientist. The 60-year-old is a former vice president of Pfizer, where he spent 16 years as an allergy and respiratory researcher. He later co-founded a biotech firm that the Swiss drugmaker Novartis purchased for at least $325 million. In recent months, Yeadon (pronounced Yee-don) has emerged as an unlikely hero of the so-called anti-vaxxers, whose adherents question the safety of many vaccines, including for the coronavirus.\\nSince then, the disease has killed about another 80,000 people in the UK. Yeadon isn\\'t the only respected scientist to have challenged the scientific consensus on COVID-19 and expressed controversial views. Michael Levitt, a winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, told the Stanford Daily last summer that he expected the pandemic would end in the United States in 2020 and kill no more than 175,000 Americans – a third of the current total – and \"when we come to look back, we\\'re going to say that wasn\\'t such a terrible disease.\"\\nThe visage and views of Yeadon, widely identified as an \"Ex-VP of Pfizer,\" can be seen on social media in languages including German, Portuguese, Danish and Czech. A Facebook post carries a video from November in which Yeadon claimed that the pandemic \"fundamentally… is over.\" The post has been viewed more than a million times. In October, Yeadon wrote a column for the United Kingdom\\'s Daily Mail newspaper that also appeared on MailOnline, one of the world\\'s most-visited news websites. It declared that deaths caused by COVID-19, which then totaled about 45,000 in Britain, will soon \"fizzle out\" and Britons \"should immediately be allowed to resume normal life.\"\\nKennedy Jr., scion of the American political dynasty, who recently was banned on Instagram because of his COVID-19 vaccine posts. Syndicated writer and vaccine skeptic Michelle Malkin reported Yeadon\\'s concern about fertility in a column last month under the headline, \"Pregnant Women: Beware of COVID Shots.\" And a blog with an alarmist headline – \"Head of Pfizer Research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization\" – was shared thousands of times on Facebook.\\n\\nThe CLAIM, published on 2020-11-06, attributes former Pfizer scientific advisor Michael Yeadon\\'s statement that the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K. and that many people had prior immunity to COVID-19.\\n\\nIn Information 1, Health Feedback, a fact-checking organization, debunked Yeadon\\'s assertion that the pandemic is over in the U.K., as it contradicts the rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths starting in September 2020. In Information 2, PolitiFact also addressed Yeadon\\'s claim, stating that experts said the U.K. was far from achieving herd immunity without a vaccine and that there was no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.\\n\\nInformation 3 provides background on Michael Yeadon, describing him as a British anti-vaccine activist and retired pharmacologist who made false or unfounded claims about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine safety. Yeadon, who had not worked with vaccines, left Pfizer in 2011 and co-founded the biotechnology company Ziarco.\\n\\nInformation 4, published on 2020-11-10, addresses a conversation between Yeadon and talk show host Julia Hartley-Brewer. Health Feedback debunked several inaccurate claims made by Yeadon during this conversation, including the idea that the pandemic is over in the U.K., the prevalence of false positives in COVID-19 tests, and the concept that viruses don\\'t create waves.\\n\\nInformation 5, published in 2021, highlights how Yeadon has become an anti-vaccine hero despite his background at Pfizer. His claims, such as the pandemic being over in the U.K. and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines causing infertility, have been widely shared on social media and news websites.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Michael Yeadon, a former Pfizer scientific advisor, claimed that the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K., this statement is contradicted by the available data on the rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country. Additionally, Health Feedback and other fact-checkers have debunked several inaccurate claims made by Yeadon regarding the pandemic and vaccines. Therefore, the CLAIM can be classified as FALSE.'"

      "Clinical studies have also reported an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism.\n",

      "The global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 880 000 people in over 180 countries or regions worldwide.1 COVID-19 is the clinical manifestation of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and most frequently presents with respiratory symptoms that can progress to pneumonia and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock. However, there is increasing awareness of the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 disease and the adverse impact that cardiovascular involvement has on prognosis.2 Discriminating between a cardiac or respiratory etiology of symptoms can be challenging since each may present predominantly with dyspnea.\n",
      "However, there is increasing awareness of the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 disease and the adverse impact that cardiovascular involvement has on prognosis.2 Discriminating between a cardiac or respiratory etiology of symptoms can be challenging since each may present predominantly with dyspnea. It is also critical to recognize when cardiac and pulmonary involvement coexist. In this paper, we present 4 cases that illustrate a variety of cardiovascular presentations of COVID-19 infection.\n",
      "It is also critical to recognize when cardiac and pulmonary involvement coexist. In this paper, we present 4 cases that illustrate a variety of cardiovascular presentations of COVID-19 infection. In addition to discussing the basic clinical physiology, we also discuss clinical decision making in the current environment, while considering resource allocation and the welfare of healthcare professionals.\n",
      "These cases illustrate the variable presentation of COVID-19 involvement of the cardiovascular system and highlight evolving considerations for treatment pathways across the spectrum of patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases (Figure 5). In patients presenting with what appears to be a typical cardiac syndrome, COVID-19 infection should be in the differential during the current pandemic, even in the absence of fever or cough.\n",

      "Although studies focused on the direct role of oxidative stress and its biomarkers in COVID-19 patient samples are not yet reported, there are ample examples of the indirect role of oxidative stress linked to SARS-CoV-2-induced multiple manifestations that have been reported [3,33,42,53,64,73,108]. This review highlights systemic oxidative stress as a potential consequence of multiple biological activities following COVID-19 infection that may exacerbate cardiac damage. Numerous antioxidants (ROS scavengers) have been tested in clinical trials to reduce the oxidative burden of cardiovascular diseases resulting in mixed outcomes.\n",
      "Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF).\n",
      "COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood.\n",
      "Recent patient data originating from different geographical locations showed that preexisting CVD is associated with a more severe COVID-19 infection [10,25,26]. A recent study by Li et al. showed that, among 1527 COVID-19-infected patients, those with CVD, diabetes, and hypertension were more likely to require ICU admissions [39]. Wu et al., with extensive COVID-19 patient data from China, reported a five-fold increase in the death rate in patients with preexisting CV complications compared with patients without CVD (10.5% vs. 2.3%) [26]. Multiple studies have shown similar findings with an increased risk of mortality in patients with prior CVD. Figure 1 summarizes the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications [40,41].\n",

      "The CLAIM states that COVID-19 is linked to multiple cardiovascular presentations. To evaluate the accuracy of this claim, we need to analyze the provided information and summarize its key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 1: This information discusses a research paper that focuses on the cardiovascular system as one of the body systems affected by COVID-19. It highlights the variability in the frequency of specific symptoms or cardiac syndromes across studies, mainly due to differences in cohort characteristics, study design, and SARS-CoV-2 variants. It also mentions the need for understanding and refining diagnosis, treatment, and exercise interventions to prevent and manage cardiovascular sequelae and the progression of CVD in high-risk patients during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 2: This information presents a study that examines the long-term cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19. The study found that COVID-19 patients had an increased risk of cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, inflammatory heart disease, ischemic heart disease, other cardiac disorders, thrombotic disorders, MACE (all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction), and any cardiovascular outcome. The study also found that the increased risks of post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes are attributable sequelae to COVID-19 itself, and the results were robust to sensitivity analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information 3: This information discusses the link between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial injury, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. It also highlights that pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, while COVID-19 itself can also induce cardiovascular complications.\n",

      "Information 5: This information focuses on the role of oxidative stress in the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19. It highlights that preexisting conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are correlated with higher severity and increased fatality rates of COVID-19. The information also discusses the multiple cardiovascular complications induced by COVID-19 and the association between preexisting cardiovascular disease and more severe COVID-19 infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the provided information supports the CLAIM that COVID-19 is linked to multiple cardiovascular presentations. The studies and cases presented in the information demonstrate the increased risk of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients, the correlation between preexisting cardiovascular conditions and severity of COVID-19 infection, and the various cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19.\n"
