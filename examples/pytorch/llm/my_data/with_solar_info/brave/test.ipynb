Yeadon, who had not worked with vaccines, then left Pfizer and with three colleagues founded the biotechnology company Ziarco, for which he served as CEO and which was sold to Novartis for $325 million in 2017. Yeadon falsely claimed in an October 2020 blog post that the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom was \"effectively over\".\\nThe Times has described him as \"a hero of Covid conspiracy theorists\" and \"a key figure in the antivax movement\". Until 2011, he served as the chief scientist and vice-president of the allergy and respiratory research division of the drug company Pfizer, and is the co-founder and former CEO of the biotechnology company Ziarco. Yeadon received his PhD under Ian Kitchen at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK. His thesis was on the respiratory system of rats. Yeadon worked with Salvador Moncada at the Wellcome Research Laboratories, focusing on airway hyper-responsiveness and the effects of pollutants such as Ozone and Nitrogen oxide, as well as working on drug discovery of 5-LO and COX.\\nHe has contributed funding to Liberty Places, a group promising to build a community on the African archipelago of Zanzibar for Europeans to escape COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine mandates.

SOURCE: Julia Hartley-Brewer, Michael Yeadon, talkRADIO, 5 Nov. 2020  ... Inaccurate: Between September and early November 2020, there was a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.K, and this trend will likely persist for some time. The claim that “the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” is false.\\nYeadon: “I am saying the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” · The suggestion that COVID-19 PCR testing produces false positives as a result of “cross-reacting” and detecting common cold coronaviruses is unsupported. As this previous Health Feedback review explained, the PCR test for COVID-19 is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and does not detect coronaviruses that cause the common cold. Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is “over in the U.K.” is contradicted by data from both the U.K. government and Our World in Data showing that there is a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.K., going from below 5,000 in September to about 25,000 in November (Figure 2).\\nInformation 5:\\nPublication date: 2021-03-18\\nTitle: SPECIAL REPORT The ex-Pfizer scientist who became an anti-vax hero ...\\nContent:\\nIn January, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a non-profit organization, found that 13% of unvaccinated people in the United States had heard that \"COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility.\" What gave the debunked claim credibility was that one of the petition\\'s co-authors, Michael Yeadon, wasn\\'t just any scientist. The 60-year-old is a former vice president of Pfizer, where he spent 16 years as an allergy and respiratory researcher. He later co-founded a biotech firm that the Swiss drugmaker Novartis purchased for at least $325 million. In recent months, Yeadon (pronounced Yee-don) has emerged as an unlikely hero of the so-called anti-vaxxers, whose adherents question the safety of many vaccines, including for the coronavirus.\\nSince then, the disease has killed about another 80,000 people in the UK. Yeadon isn\\'t the only respected scientist to have challenged the scientific consensus on COVID-19 and expressed controversial views. Michael Levitt, a winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, told the Stanford Daily last summer that he expected the pandemic would end in the United States in 2020 and kill no more than 175,000 Americans – a third of the current total – and \"when we come to look back, we\\'re going to say that wasn\\'t such a terrible disease.\"\\nThe visage and views of Yeadon, widely identified as an \"Ex-VP of Pfizer,\" can be seen on social media in languages including German, Portuguese, Danish and Czech. A Facebook post carries a video from November in which Yeadon claimed that the pandemic \"fundamentally… is over.\" The post has been viewed more than a million times. In October, Yeadon wrote a column for the United Kingdom\\'s Daily Mail newspaper that also appeared on MailOnline, one of the world\\'s most-visited news websites. It declared that deaths caused by COVID-19, which then totaled about 45,000 in Britain, will soon \"fizzle out\" and Britons \"should immediately be allowed to resume normal life.\"\\nKennedy Jr., scion of the American political dynasty, who recently was banned on Instagram because of his COVID-19 vaccine posts. Syndicated writer and vaccine skeptic Michelle Malkin reported Yeadon\\'s concern about fertility in a column last month under the headline, \"Pregnant Women: Beware of COVID Shots.\" And a blog with an alarmist headline – \"Head of Pfizer Research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization\" – was shared thousands of times on Facebook.\\n\\nThe CLAIM, published on 2020-11-06, attributes former Pfizer scientific advisor Michael Yeadon\\'s statement that the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K. and that many people had prior immunity to COVID-19.\\n\\nIn Information 1, Health Feedback, a fact-checking organization, debunked Yeadon\\'s assertion that the pandemic is over in the U.K., as it contradicts the rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths starting in September 2020. In Information 2, PolitiFact also addressed Yeadon\\'s claim, stating that experts said the U.K. was far from achieving herd immunity without a vaccine and that there was no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.\\n\\nInformation 3 provides background on Michael Yeadon, describing him as a British anti-vaccine activist and retired pharmacologist who made false or unfounded claims about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine safety. Yeadon, who had not worked with vaccines, left Pfizer in 2011 and co-founded the biotechnology company Ziarco.\\n\\nInformation 4, published on 2020-11-10, addresses a conversation between Yeadon and talk show host Julia Hartley-Brewer. Health Feedback debunked several inaccurate claims made by Yeadon during this conversation, including the idea that the pandemic is over in the U.K., the prevalence of false positives in COVID-19 tests, and the concept that viruses don\\'t create waves.\\n\\nInformation 5, published in 2021, highlights how Yeadon has become an anti-vaccine hero despite his background at Pfizer. His claims, such as the pandemic being over in the U.K. and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines causing infertility, have been widely shared on social media and news websites.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Michael Yeadon, a former Pfizer scientific advisor, claimed that the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K., this statement is contradicted by the available data on the rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country. Additionally, Health Feedback and other fact-checkers have debunked several inaccurate claims made by Yeadon regarding the pandemic and vaccines. Therefore, the CLAIM can be classified as FALSE.'"

      "To classify the CLAIM accurately, it is essential to analyze the provided information and reason based on our knowledge.

      "However, Information 1, published on the same date as the CLAIM, debunks this claim. It explains that the cloud is not strange at all but is, in fact, a lenticular cloud, which existed before the pandemic.

Instead, the formation of this cloud is attributed to air movements in the troposphere.\n",
