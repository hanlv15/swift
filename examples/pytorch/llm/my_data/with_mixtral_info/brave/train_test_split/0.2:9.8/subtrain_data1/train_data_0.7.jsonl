It absolutely wasn’t done to be sensational,” he said. While it may be the case that there is a character limit on Twitter, the tweet makes a critical judgement that only those without an underlying medical condition die ‘from’ Covid-19.\nThere have been more than 1,700 deaths from Covid-19. Eight of those who have died were under the age of 65 and did not have an underlying condition. Of course, each of the 1,700 deaths is a tragedy.

According to Information 1 and 2, which were published on the same date as the claim, 113 people under the age of 65 had died of COVID-19 in Ireland at that time.

Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ...

The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim.

Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the Guatemala ombudsman wants citizens to pay for their COVID-19 tests, as testing was already available for payment at private clinics and hospitals at the time the claim was published.\n\nFurthermore, Information 2 and 4, both published after the claim, report about 30,000 fake COVID-19 tests in Guatemala, indicating that the government was not encouraging citizens to pay for testing but rather dealing with issues related to fake tests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Based on these points alone, it seems a sauna can kill coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna can kill the novel coronavirus. The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year. We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread. The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004.\nViral posts on social media claim COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in \"every election year,\" suggesting that the new coronavirus is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump. But most of the dates cited to defend those conclusions about previous outbreaks are misleading or incorrect.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim that every election year has a disease is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations including Reuters, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org.\n* The claim lists various diseases such as SARS, avian flu, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus, and matches them up to election years since 2004.\n* However, most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.\n* Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n* While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n* The claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim that every election year has a disease is false. Most of the diseases listed in the claim were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years. While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons. However, the evidence shows that most of the diseases listed in the claim had little to no impact on U.S. elections and were not directly linked to election years.", "response": "FALSE."}

The test can be performed in environments where the patient specimen is both collected and analyzed, such as doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, using an instrument about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage.\nThe performance of the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer was validated in a large study of 2,409 individuals, including those with and without symptoms. In the study, the test was shown to have 91.2% sensitivity (the percent of positive samples the test correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the percent of negative samples the test correctly identified).\nWhen the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer detects the presence of VOC markers of SARS-CoV-2, a presumptive (unconfirmed) positive test result is returned and should be confirmed with a molecular test. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as they do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions.\nInspectIR expects to be able to produce approximately 100 instruments per week, which can each be used to evaluate approximately 160 samples per day. At this level of production, testing capacity using the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer is expected to increase by approximately 64,000 samples per month.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-07-31\nTitle: Scientists develop breath test that rapidly detects COVID-19 virus ...\nContent:\nLouis have developed a breath test that quickly identifies those who are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

For many people, the 30 seconds of nasal swabbing can’t go by fast enough. But what if you could skip the swabs altogether? And what if the process could be as simple as breathing?\nThe FDA has authorized the first COVID-19 test that uses breath samples. It can be used by adults with or without symptoms of COVID-19.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\". So what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter? It's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\nIt's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market.\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-21\nTitle: Fact check: Did coronavirus originate in a Chinese laboratory?\nContent:\nWe have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\" We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.\nOne of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China. Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab · More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say · The article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”\nThese sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.\nThis is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, was dismissive of the theory of an accidental escape from a Chinese laboratory, USA TODAY reported on April 18.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-04-01\nTitle: Theory That COVID Came From A Chinese Lab Takes On New Life In ...\nContent:\nTheory That COVID Came From A Chinese Lab Takes On New Life In Wake Of WHO Report : Coronavirus Updates Some scientists worry the possibility the coronavirus escaped from research facilities hasn't gotten enough scrutiny. Others say it appears far more likely to have emerged naturally.\nA State Department fact sheet from mid-January highlights reports of sick lab researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the fall of 2019, notes the dangerous type of coronavirus research the lab was conducting and said there was also secret military activity at the lab. China has refuted the claims. Critics of the WHO report, such as Metzl, said the expert team that visited the lab took their Chinese interlocutors at their word and didn't dig.\n\"I think there were a lot of people who did put together the fact that you had an outbreak in Wuhan and you have these laboratories in Wuhan fairly immediately,\" said David Feith, who was an Asia adviser in the Trump administration's State Department when the coronavirus emerged.\nBefore COVID-19, few scientists would have pegged the city of Wuhan, in temperate central China, as a likely starting point for a global coronavirus pandemic.

But the city of 11 million straddling the Yangtze River is home to some of China's most advanced biological research laboratories.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published anonymously, discusses the debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China. It mentions that the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-13 by Chequeado, states that the coronavirus is not synthetic and was not created in a Chinese laboratory. It also mentions the importance of checking the publication date of fact-checks before sharing them.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2021-05-27 by BBC, discusses the Wuhan lab-leak theory and its re-emergence in 2023. It explains the suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan and the presence of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as a major biological research facility in the city. It also mentions an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the virus originating from Fort Detrick in Maryland.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-03-21 by USA TODAY, is a fact-check article that rates the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. It mentions that suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons were debunked.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-04-01 by NPR, discusses the Wuhan lab-leak theory and its resurgence in the wake of a WHO report. It highlights reports of sick lab researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the fall of 2019 and mentions China's refutation of the claims.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus is synthetic and was created in a Chinese laboratory is FALSE based on the available information. The WHO has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created. Additionally, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus is synthetic and was created in a Chinese laboratory is not supported by the available information. The WHO has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created. Furthermore, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nWhile there is debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China, the consensus among scientific experts is that the virus has an animal origin. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade, and the lab is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that the virus escaped from the WIV.\n\nIt is important to note that the publication date of the claim is 2020-04-13, while the publication date of Information 3 is 2021-05-27. Therefore, the claim was made before the re-emergence of the Wuhan lab-leak theory in 2023. However, even with this sequential relationship, the consensus among scientific experts remains that the virus has an animal origin.", "response": "FALSE."}

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false.

The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.)

Its dissemination, however, does tell us an awful lot about a screwed-up media system that allows unscrupulous companies and individuals to spread misinformation. The original press release from 5WPR notes that in a survey of 737 beer-drinking Americans, 38 percent said they “would not buy Corona under any circumstances now.” By presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans’ reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus.\nHave you heard that 38 percent of Americans won’t drink Corona beer, because they are afraid of contracting the coronavirus? For the past hours, this finding has spread across the internet like wildfire (or, more apt, a dangerous disease). CNN, the New York Post, and Vice all wrote up the poll. On Twitter, where “38% of Americans” was the top national trend for parts of the day, many writers with large followings used it as an occasion to condemn their fellow citizens as idiots.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by PolitiFact, is an article fact-checking a claim about a poll that found 38% of Americans saying they will not drink Corona beer because of the virus.

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)).

We conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.\nWe conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccines BNT162b1 or BNT162b2—lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode secreted, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or prefusion-stabilized S, respectively—induce strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice and macaques.\nTherefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19 vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses. Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

Research with animals connects these vaccines with other SARS-CoV-2 scientific advancements just as it has made connections among NPRC HIV/AIDS studies, the results from which facilitated the rapid pace to COVID-19 discoveries.\nBut if everyone knew how critical animals have been in 2020 to fast-track a safe and effective COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine, would that change? Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) called upon the National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) – as NIH has for HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika and other infectious disease threats – to identify animal species for studying the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developing safe and effective vaccines to block it.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: Experimental NIH Sudan virus vaccine protects macaques | National ...\nContent:\nA National Institutes of Health research group with extensive experience studying ebolavirus countermeasures has successfully developed a vaccine against Sudan virus (SUDV) based on the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine.

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020). Human activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).\nHuman activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). The pandemic has caused reduced air pollution as public mobility is halted, airlines being shut down, and other highway transportation being canceled, which gives us the opportunity to breathe in a low carbon air (Monks 2020, April 20).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The world faces an air pollution 'pandemic' | EurekAlert ...\nContent:\nProfessors Jos Lelieveld and Thomas Münzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Department of Cardiology of the University Medical Centre Mainz in Mainz, Germany, who led the research, say the findings suggest the world is facing an air pollution \"pandemic\". Using a new method of modelling the effects of various sources of air pollution on death rates, the researchers estimated that globally air pollution caused an extra 8.8 million premature deaths a year in 2015. This represents an average shortening of life expectancy of nearly three years for all persons worldwide.\nProf Münzel said: \"Since the impact of air pollution on public health overall is much larger than expected, and is a worldwide phenomenon, we believe our results show there is an 'air pollution pandemic'. Policy-makers and the medical community should be paying much more attention to this.\nThe researchers estimate that if air pollution was reduced by removing fossil fuel emissions, the average life expectancy worldwide would increase by just over a year, and by nearly two years if all human-made emissions were removed.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2019-07-30\nTitle: Air pollution\nContent:\nHealth, environment and climate change: road map for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution: report by the Director-General (WHA71/10 Add.1) ...

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two Rare Neurologic Conditions Linked to COVID-19\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ... Select a dashboard: Weekly Excess Deaths Excess deaths with and without COVID-19 Excess deaths with and without weighting Number of Excess Deaths\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The true death toll of COVID-19: estimating global excess mortality\nContent:\nThe COVID TAG considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability and extensibility proposed a negative binomial regression model. The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.\nDeaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. The provisional data presented on this page include the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; by week ending date, month, and year, and specific jurisdictions.\nDeath counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. Information 5 is from the National Center for Health Statistics and provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 in the US.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that the total number of deaths in the US in 2020 is significantly down compared to previous years is false. In fact, the opposite is true. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a large increase in total US deaths in 2020, with deaths still up 19.7% in 2021 compared to 2019.

However, it has been proposed that inadvertent inhalation (especially if ABHS are used in poorly ventilated areas) rather than topical absorption is more likely to result in high enough amounts of alcohol exposure to elicit a disulfiram reaction [95].\nKeywords: hand sanitizers, alcohol, hand hygiene, tetrahedron, antiseptic, COVID-19 · Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have emerged as an important tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The disease has spread rapidly throughout the world thereby necessitating stringent measures and controls to minimize its transmission.\nThe use of technical grade alcohol is typically not permitted due the high level of impurities.

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]].

The man in the video inhales and exhales through two different surgical masks, a cupped mask, a cloth mask, a mask with filter material and a respirator with a valve.\n“I am disappointed that a licensed physician would use smoke as an equivalent comparison,” said Hogue, although as noted above, Noel’s license has expired. Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in aerosols, said in an email: “I consider that video disinformation because they clearly don’t know what they are doing with that test.” · The effectiveness of masks in limiting the potential spread of coronavirus has been extensively documented.\nA YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free.

The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’\" But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode.\nIf you're carrying alcohol-based hand sanitizer wherever you go, congratulations—it's what we've been advised to do by public-health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic. However, don't leave it inside your car, because the very alcohol that helps kill germs is also very flammable.\nThe fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode. Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid \"which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-05-28\nTitle: Can hand sanitiser catch fire in a hot car? - Full Fact\nContent:\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363°C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side. So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire. But that doesn’t mean hand sanitiser left in a car that gets warmer than this will ignite on its own, unless there is a spark.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-05-22\nTitle: Will Hand Sanitizer Combust If Left in a Hot Car? | Snopes.com\nContent:\nIt tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel. Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes: ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid.\n\"Deixar Alcool Em Gel No Console Exposto ao Sol Faz o Carro Pegar Fogo?\" Quatro Rodas. 20 April 2020.

A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we've yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way.\nSoon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion. For starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak. There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.", "response": "FALSE."}

She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it.

Their technique, detailed in a paper published this month in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology, could help regions manage risks to avoid scenarios like the recent outbreak in New York City, where the virus inflicted devastation on one of the most densely populated areas in the country. Knowing that COVID-19 is easily spread by individuals in close proximity, Chong and his team developed a method that helps them identify the most crowded areas with hustle and bustle, such as a city center, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people.\nUnlike contact tracing applications that are often difficult to deploy and require widespread adoption, his approach protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users. “Our method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps,” Chong said. “All we have to do is perform the measurements using anonymous data that is already being collected for other reasons.

The main factor for contagion in COVID-19 is proximity to an infected patient or carrier. The patients and carriers may spread the virus before even showing any symptoms or knowing that they carry the disease, exposing other individuals who may be at risk without anyone knowing it.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-26\nTitle: Using cellular networks to detect at-risk areas for spread of COVID-19\nContent:\nCitation: Using cellular networks to detect at-risk areas for spread of COVID-19 (2020, June 26) retrieved 6 May 2023 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-cellular-networks-at-risk-areas-covid-.html · This document is subject to copyright.

Crowded regions with actively moving people (called at-risk regions) are susceptible to spreading the disease, especially if they contain asymptomatic infected people together with healthy people.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 4, and 5 all discuss a study conducted by researchers at Colorado State University, led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Edwin Chong. The researchers developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy is detailed in a paper published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020 (Alsaeedy & Chong, 2020). The technique they developed helps identify the most crowded areas, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people. This method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps as it protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users.\n\nInformation 3 provides additional context about the underlying technologies and privacy concerns related to using mobile networks for tracking movements of people and relating them to the spread of COVID-19. It mentions a paper by Alsaeedy and Chong (2020) that explores performance indicators in a network to determine how crowded certain cells in a mobile network are and monitor their mobility with neighboring cells, to assess the risk of COVID-19 spread.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim is TRUE. The researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy was published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020.\n\nReference:\nAlaa A. R. Alsaeedy, Edwin K. P. Chong.

On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic something is, on a scale of 0-14. Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better.

The coronavirus uses RNA as its genetic material.\nNote: Since this story about Merck’s molnupiravir was originally published, the Food and Drug Administration has provided emergency use authorizations for pills from both Merck and Pfizer. Scientists continue to study the real-world effectiveness of both. Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nOver the past year, discussions—sometimes heated ones—about ending the COVID-19 pandemic have largely focused on the availability, effectiveness, and safety of vaccines.

The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus. For temperatures above 65°C (149°F) is expected to cause near complete inactivation with exposures greater than 3 minutes. For temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that these findings agree with WHO guidelines which report a 4 log reduction of coronavirus for 56°C (133°F) with 15‐minute exposures 14 and is consistent with information for killing other infectious agents. 15\nHowever, for temperatures in the range 50‐55°C (122‐131°F) we recommend 20 minutes or longer of exposure. At these levels, we expect the viral concentration to be lowered by log 5‐7, near or below the detectable limit. Because of the seriousness of the current coronavirus infection, we suggest a reasonable safety factor can be obtained by increasing the above‐listed temperatures by 10°C (about 18 °F).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can just hot water kill the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?

The article states that most coronaviruses would be almost completely killed after exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes. The article also mentions that temperatures of 50 to 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes can also kill the virus.\n\nInformation 4, no publication date, is an article that provides a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus. The article states that for temperatures above 65°C (149°F) is expected to cause near complete inactivation with exposures greater than 3 minutes. The article also mentions that for temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\n\nInformation 5, no publication date, is an article that states that hot water alone cannot kill the virus that causes COVID-19 on surfaces. The article mentions that very high temperatures will also inactivate the virus, but this is not an advised household practice.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that warm drinks kill the coronavirus, the virus dies when the ambient temperature is higher than 26ºC, gargling warm water helps treat the disease and the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nAccording to Information 1, published on the same date as the claim, the claim is false. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that warm drinks, high ambient temperatures, and gargling warm water do not kill the virus. The claim that the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is also false, as the WHO states that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to several days.\n\nInformation 3, 4 and 5 also support the fact that the claim is false. Information 3 and 4 state that the virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more. Information 5 states that hot water alone cannot kill the virus on surfaces.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that warm drinks kill the coronavirus, the virus dies when the ambient temperature is higher than 26ºC, gargling warm water helps treat the disease and the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is false. The virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more.

Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that people will be starved if they reject the vaccine and do not have a chip. While there have been proposals to pay people to be vaccinated, these payments are intended to incentivize vaccination, not to punish those who do not get vaccinated.

WASHINGTON — The United States saw 2 million new COVID-19 cases in the first 16 days of November, a sign that the country has a rough winter ahead.\nPresident Trump claims that COVID-19 cases in the us are only going up because of more testing. The data tells a different story.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge 'Only' Due to Testing, Misleads ...\nContent:\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February. New coronavirus booster: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone 6 months or older get an updated coronavirus shot, but the vaccine rollout has seen some hiccups, especially for children.\nNo one thinks that anywhere near half the state’s population had covid-19 at that time, so those results would imply that testing was overly focused on a subset of the population highly likely to be infected. Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization. These days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-26\nTitle: No, President Trump, Testing Is Not Causing Case Counts to Rise.\nContent:\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. These assertions are not backed up by the data, a ProPublica analysis shows. While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased. To be sure, the virus exacted a tremendous toll on New York state and on New York City. Though COVID-19 now appears to be under control, more than 389,000 residents of New York state were infected and more than 24,700 died.\nThe Trump administration has doubled down on its claims that coronavirus case counts are up because the U.S. has increased testing.

Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel weighed in on the appropriate soundtrack to the president’s bare-faced appearance at the Honeywell aerospace plant in Phoenix. “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song ‘Live and Let Die’ blares in the background,” Kimmel wrote on Twitter.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges Americans to wear face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 71,000 people in the U.S. in less than three months. Face coverings are thought to protect the people around the person wearing the mask as much as the mask-wearer. The White House has said people close to the president are screened for the virus and Trump, who is tested regularly, is not a threat to spread the infection.\nGuns ‘n Roses’ rocking rendition of “Live and Let Die” played as President Trump visited an Arizona mask factory without wearing a mask Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic…\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-06\nTitle: Guns N' Roses' Live And Let Die Cover Plays As Trump Visits Mask…\nContent:\nVarious clips of Donald Trump's visit to a mask factory in Phoenix on Tuesday have today gone viral – not only because the president wasn't even wearing a mask himself as a precaution against coronavirus (going against the factory's policy), but because of the fact that workers appropriately blasted Guns N' Roses' cover of Live And Let Die during his tour. The Donald and his entourage were at a Honeywell factory to witness the production of anti-COVID-19 N95 masks, with the soundtrack reportedly consisting of the likes of Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger and Animals' House Of The Rising Sun. But, as Trump turned to one worker to ask how many masks were made in a day, symphonic rock hit Live And Let Die could be heard playing in the background.\nOf course, the internet instantly jumped on the irony of the track playing over Trump's visit, with U.S. TV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.\nTV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.

Methods: We conducted a literature search and identified 232 articles; we included 90 after screening. We pulled information from each article using standardized questions for “type of study,” “population,” “specific vaccine,” “reasons for hesitancy,” “hesitancy prevalence,” “attempt at change,” “results of intervention,” and “future interventions.” We created recurrent themes from the data and analyzed these themes via descriptive statistics.\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do give guidance on general approaches to these conversations, keeping up with hard data and multiple studies on various vaccinations can be tedious and is not realistic for many doctors.8,9 · The theme of not enough information is highlighted by more research being cited as the most commonly proposed future intervention.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents.

The image was shared on Thai and Hindi Facebook with similar claims.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-08, also debunks the claim that the image shows a family who committed suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. The investigation found that the image has no connection with the current lockdown in India nor the COVID-19 pandemic. The incident occurred in June 2019 due to a woman's husband's excessive alcoholism.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-02-17, states that the image has circulated online since May of 2018, long before the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim that the image shows the bodies of an Indian family who committed suicide after running out of food during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown is false.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is false. The image has been circulating online since 2018, and it shows a murder-suicide that occurred in India's Karnataka state in June 2019, unrelated to the COVID-19 lockdown.", "response": "FALSE."}

Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.

Various conspiracy theories targeting Gates, Fauci and others have frequently circulated online, especially on social media, where some platforms took steps to remove posts that spread misinformation.\nIn October, Gates told CNBC that he was concerned that baseless conspiracy theories about himself and Fauci could be harmful to the U.S. coronavirus response if they chipped away at people's trust in public health strategies, such as the rollout of Covid vaccines.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-21, is an article from Fatabyyano stating that the claim about the coronavirus being a hoax to pass Bill Gates' vaccine is false. The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 has been observed through microscopic imagery. The allegation about Bill Gates' vaccine is not based on any evidence.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-05-29, is an article from BBC News discussing conspiracy theories about Bill Gates' involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic. These theories include claims that Gates wants to use a COVID-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin. The Italian Parliament has seen an anti-vaccination movement, with an independent MP calling for Gates to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-09-10, is an article from Reuters fact-checking a conspiracy theory that Bill Gates is responsible for COVID-19. The article also addresses false claims about population control and the misinterpretation of a speech given by Gates at a TED conference in 2010.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-05, is an article from BBC News discussing Bill Gates becoming the voodoo doll of COVID-19 conspiracies. The article mentions various conspiracy theories, including Gates wanting to use a COVID-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is an article from Business Insider discussing Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci being targets of baseless coronavirus conspiracy theories. The article mentions false claims about Gates and Fauci being linked to the coronavirus' origins and Gates planning to use COVID-19 vaccines to implant monitoring microchips in billions of people.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that there is nothing called coronavirus and it is just a hoax to pass Bill Gates' vaccine is false. The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 has been observed through microscopic imagery, and the claim about Bill Gates' vaccine is not based on any evidence. This is consistent with Information 1, Information 2, Information 3, Information 4, and Information 5.", "response": "FALSE."}

At the same time, the vaccines are intended to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, or at least severe or fatal COVID-19 infections. So far, four COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), all encoding the spike protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, by PolitiFact, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that autopsies prove COVID-19 is a blood clot and should be fought with antibiotics. The article explains that COVID-19 is a viral infection, and antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Autopsies in Italy revealed that blood clotting is an additional effect of COVID-19, causing lung damage.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 1, 2020, by FactCheck.org, supports Information 1, emphasizing that COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not bacteria, and antibiotics have no effect on the virus.\n\nInformation 3 is a reproduction of the fact-check article from PolitiFact, confirming the information provided in 1 and 2.\n\nInformation 4, although the publication date is not provided, discusses the autopsy findings and venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies.

No country has experienced as devastating a wave of COVID-19 infections as India is now. It set a new record for single-day infections last week, overtaking the United States, and it accounts for almost half of new cases worldwide.

Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors. It usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from COVID-19, suggest the “Guidelines on Operationalization of COVID Care Services for Children & Adolescents”, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in June 2021.\nWhile the proportion of children getting infected by COVID-19 is still not frightening, it is significant enough to establish that children are not as immune to post-COVID-19 complications as thought. Even the sketchy government numbers suggest a steady increase in the share of children in India’s total active COVID-19 cases, which includes patients still infectious.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How India is dealing with COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nIndia, which has the second-largest population in the world is suffering severely from COVID-19 disease. By May 18th, India investigated ∼1 lakh (0.1million) infected cases from COVID-19, and as of 11th July the cases equalled 8 lakhs. Social distancing and lockdown rules were employed in India, which however had an additional impact on the economy, human living, and environment.\nCOVID-19 outbreak is the sixth PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola (2014 in West Africa), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo) [3]. India which is the second-largest population in the world having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on18th May 2020, and as of 11th of July crossed 8.5 lakhs.\nCOVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time. For 2020, the tourism industry and air travel are expected to suffer greatly, and India's GDP growth is expected to decline ∼2.5% from 5.3%.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impacts of India's second COVID-19 wave on children | Coronavirus ...\nContent:\nWith schools closed, parents unable to work and many caregivers who are ill or hospitalised, the second wave of COVID-19 in India is leaving devastating impacts on the emotional and physical well-being of children.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

The WHO's 'Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe' policy framework does include guidance that children under the age of four should be given information about \"early childhood masturbation\" and encouraged to explore so-called gender identities. However, this information was published in 2020 and 2023, after the claim was made in 2020.

BBC Future looks at whether there is any evidence to support one particularly common claim. A hot drink can offer comfort, especially on a chilly day. It can act as a salve for a troubled mind, and can make us feel closer to other people. It can even help us cool down in hot weather. But while many people might seek out a cup of coffee, a mug of tea or a hot toddie to help them in these difficult times, one thing a hot drink won’t do is protect you from Covid-19.\nThe hot drink does not, however, get rid of the virus causing the infection in the first place.

Indigenous nations' own codes and policies can be instituted to bolster this response, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US (Hiraldo et al., 2021).\nIn Australia, there are early indications of establishing regional data infrastructure so Indigenous nations can use data for development (National Agreement on Closing the Gap, 2020). One policy proposal to assist in the current COVID-19 environment for Indigenous communities to respond to COVID-19 is to invest in technological solutions such as a syndromic surveillance system for Indigenous community-controlled/based data systems where there are options to do so, and appropriate Indigenous data governance can be applied.\nData sharing involves both the release of tribal information as well as the sharing of tribal information that other governments hold, such as COVID-19 related data, with tribes. A number of states and the federal government have denied tribal rights to access data for decision-making (Tahir and Cancryn, 2020). There is a recognized need for other governments and organizations to establish data sharing agreements and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples (Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Indigenous Data Working Group, 2020; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).\nThe United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2020); World Health Organization (2020), and the Pan American Health Organization (del Pino and Camacho, 2020) call for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data (direct and indirect) and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples. In the US, there has been a call for the availability of data disaggregated by Indigenous nations and tribal affiliation themselves, with the caveat that this must be done within the context of Indigenous governance of those data, including data sharing agreements (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous Communities in Canada | The Health ...\nContent:\nPurpose: The purpose of this literature review was to explore the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. Methods: A literature review was conducted in June 2021. An infographic was created after a review of the literature.

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive. This indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\nThis indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets. However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%. Also read: What You Need to Know Before Trying to Make Sense of Sero-Survey Results · However, the researchers cautioned that four of the 15 districts in the survey (and out of 233 such districts in India, per the paper) with ‘zero cases’ didn’t have COVID-19 testing laboratories at the district headquarters and that samples collected in the area for tests had to be transported to state-headquarter hospitals.\n“The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas,” the researchers conclude. On July 10, PTI had reported that ICMR would conduct “a nationwide seroprevalence survey to determine the exposure of the novel coronavirus among the population … as a follow-up” to the one conducted in May-June.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is the official website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.\n\nInformation 2 is about a study conducted by ICMR that found that Indian food habits and ingredients, such as idli, rajma, zinc, fiber, and catechins present in tea, may have played an important role in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India. The study compared transcriptome profiles of COVID-19 patients from south India (Karnataka) and north India (Haryana) with those of Western populations.\n\nInformation 3 is about the importance of data sharing and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous nations' own codes and policies, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US. The information also highlights the need for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples.\n\nInformation 4 is a literature review of the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. The review found that many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. However, Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nInformation 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey. The survey found that 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive, indicating that India's COVID-19 epidemic had spread to rural parts despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\n\nClaim: As per ICMR study there’s been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. Information 2 is an ICMR study that focused on the role of food habits and ingredients in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them. Information 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them.

According to the Coroners Court of Victoria, there were 49 suicides in Victoria during September 2020. While the number of suicides in Victoria for the whole of 2019 is not explicitly stated in the information provided, it is highly unlikely that the monthly rate for September 2020 is equivalent to the annual rate for the entire year of 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that there are 125 suicides per week in Victoria alone, compared to 56 suicides per week in Australia before COVID-19, is also misleading. The provided information states that there were 3,046 deaths by suicide in Australia in 2018, which translates to approximately 58 suicides per week.

In all countries, there were sharp increases at the beginning of the pandemic, and again in late 2020 and early 2021. Scotland and Northern Ireland registered their highest proportion of weekly deaths in care homes involving COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic (week 18 2020: Scotland 49.4%; Northern Ireland 50.0%). England registered their highest proportion in early 2021 (week 4 2021, 48.9%), as did Wales (week 3 2021, 58.4%).\nThe Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) weekly provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland includes all deaths with coronavirus (COVID-19) mentioned on the death certificate. Figures presented on the latest insights tool are different from the daily surveillance figures on COVID-19 deaths published by the Department of Health and Social Care, which provide daily and cumulative deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive test.\nThere were 619 deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK in the latest week (ending 17 March 2023). This is a rise from 605 in the previous week. Of these, 512 were registered in England, 47 in Wales, 56 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland. A total of 13,683 deaths were registered in the UK in the week ending 17 March 2023, which was 9.3% above the five-year average. In the same week, deaths involving COVID-19 accounted for 4.5% of all deaths in the UK, compared with 4.6% in the previous week.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality - statistics - Statistics Explained\nContent:\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of the EU; however, its impact was not evenly spread. The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nData from Ireland were not included in the first phase of the excess mortality release: official timely data were not available because deaths in Ireland can be registered up to three months after the date of death. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.

Italy did not miscalculate their death toll by 90%, and the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar did not confirm that Ireland's statistics are inflated. England did lower their official count by some 5,000, but that was due to a change in its classification of deaths related to the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3 is from a publication in 2023-03-27, which provides the latest insights on COVID-19 deaths in the UK.

To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23. Panta Gopal & Richardson Ann & Shaw Ian. Effectiveness of autoclaving in sterilizing reusable medical devices in healthcare facilities.\nSeveral studies have shown the effects of different sterilization methods, including gamma sterilization, plasma sterilization, steam and dry heat sterilization, microwaves, washing machines and UV–C light, as methods to decontaminate face masks for reuse [9–13]. These studies suggest that gamma and steam sterilization conducted at 134°C damage the microstructure of the filter material [9].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can Disposable Face Masks Be Reused? | Primo Dental Products\nContent:\nAll that considered, it’s only the right time to ask the question: can disposable face masks be reused? And if so, how can you reuse them properly? In this article, we will talk about which face masks can be reused, the proper way to sterilize and reuse your face mask, and what to do with your disposable face masks after you reuse them for the final time.\nAll these instances aside, it may be possible to reuse your disposable mask safely. This brings us to our next topic: Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them.\nCan disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them. It is not necessary to douse your disposable mask in rubbing alcohol or disinfectant. In fact, treating your face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\nIn healthcare settings, disposable face masks cannot be reused. For general protection against COVID-19, on the other hand, it is possible to sterilize and reuse face masks.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study was conducted to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks for reuse. The masks were sterilized using a 15-minute procedure at 121 ºC with both dry and regular steam processes in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes was sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus. After sterilization, the samples were tested and benchmarked with new mouth masks.\n\nInformation 2: A rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides, and other information available online was conducted to identify the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks and the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization. The most promising methods for disinfection are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat, and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave, or steam are not fully recommended.\n\nInformation 3: A discussion on the feasibility of sterilization and reuse of disposable dust masks was conducted. Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}
