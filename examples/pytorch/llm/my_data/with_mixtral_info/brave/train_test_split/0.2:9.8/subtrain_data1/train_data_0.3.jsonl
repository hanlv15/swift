By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.

Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities.

However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context.

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic something is, on a scale of 0-14. Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better. But this is because these are, simply put, healthy foods – not because of any changing pH levels in the blood or the body.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2017-06-16\nTitle: NO DISEASE CAN EXIST IN AN ALKALINE ENVIRONMENT — Natural Food ...\nContent:\nThe pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.

It states that the body's pH level is tightly regulated and cannot be significantly altered through diet. The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, with 0-6 being acidic, 7 neutral, and 8-14 basic. The body strives to maintain a pH of 7.365. Eating an 80/20 ratio of alkaline to acidic foods is recommended for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2019-07-03, further emphasizes the importance of maintaining an alkaline state in the body to prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health. It suggests a breathing technique to alkalize the body.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, undated but published by the same source, reinforce the idea that diet does not affect the pH of the body. The body maintains a constant, slightly alkaline pH in the blood, and diseases like cancer live in slightly alkaline environments. The alkaline diet, consisting of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, is considered healthy but does not change pH levels in the blood or body.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2017-06-16, focuses on the importance of consuming alkaline foods to neutralize acidity in the body. It promotes alkaline water as a means to maintain health and prevent illness.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-02-26, states that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. However, the information presented suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body. The body tightly regulates its pH, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments. Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide protection against contagion.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. In fact, the information suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments. Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide any protective benefits against contagion.", "response": "FALSE."}

Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur.

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather. The article explains that while the threat from hand sanitizer exploding might be overstated, there is still a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 24, 2020, from an article on WFTV, shares a statement from a fire expert who explains that a car's internal temperature would need to reach 572 degrees to cause hand sanitizer to explode.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources.

Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.

This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.

However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths.

County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years.

The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Her life and work have been followed by many, her accomplishments abound. As experts on pancreatic cancer and admirers of justice, we watched with cautious awe as she fell into slimmer and slimmer statistical margins over time.\nWe often struggle with patients feeling defined by their illness, especially one with the lethality of pancreatic cancer. Their cognitive frame suddenly shifts from their grandchildren’s soccer games and dreams of travel to measuring time in two-week cycles. Chemotherapy sessions, doctor’s appointments, scan suddenly define their time. Doing such, though, allows cancer to invade one’s very sense of self as it invades organ structure. Justice Ginsburg, though, demonstrated that cancer can be part of a person without being the whole person.\nHow good could her prognosis be? But each one of the lessons noted above was brought into this world by Justice Ginsburg in the 11-years between her diagnosis and death from pancreatic cancer.

One more huzzah should be added to the list: cancer survivor. Ginsburg was first diagnosed with colon cancer two decades ago, and over a period of more than 20 years beat it back. She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it. A decade later came a new diagnosis, pancreatic cancer, discovered early because the jurist was still undergoing regular screening because of her first cancer. In 2018, two tumors were surgically removed from her lungs, and then last year a new malignancy was discovered on her pancreas.\n\nInformation 1, published on September 23, 2020, confirms that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died due to metastatic pancreatic cancer. It also provides a timeline of her cancer history, including colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009, lung cancer in 2018, and liver lesions in 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published on September 25, 2020, also confirms that Justice Ginsburg died from pancreatic cancer on September 18, 2020.

On December 31, 2019, delegates of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) went to Wuhan for field investigations, and the sample of new virus was isolated and further identified as a pathogen of unexplained pneumonia on January 6, 2020.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 from Lead Stories (published on 2020-02-14) both fact-check a claim that a residential building was set on fire in Wuhan to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. The information explains that the fire actually occurred in Chongqing, a city about 850 kilometers away from Wuhan, and was not related to the coronavirus outbreak. The false claim originated from an article published by intellihub.com on February 10, 2020.\n\nInformation 3 from AFP (published on 2020-02-19) also clarifies that the fire took place in Chongqing and not Wuhan. Wuhan Fire Service had refuted the claim on their verified Weibo account on February 7, 2020.\n\nInformation 4 from the Associated Press (published on 2020-02-20) further debunks the false claim, stating that the fire was caused by an improperly extinguished cigarette in Chongqing, not by any efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Wuhan.\n\nInformation 5 does not have a publication date or directly relate to the claim, but provides general background information about the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China.\n\nClaim Classification:\n\nThe claim is FALSE. All available information from reputable sources indicates that the residential building fire occurred in Chongqing, China, and not in Wuhan as claimed. The fire was not related to the novel coronavirus outbreak and was caused by an improperly extinguished cigarette, not by any efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.", "response": "FALSE."}

It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year. We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread. The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004.\nViral posts on social media claim COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in \"every election year,\" suggesting that the new coronavirus is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump. But most of the dates cited to defend those conclusions about previous outbreaks are misleading or incorrect.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim that every election year has a disease is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations including Reuters, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org.\n* The claim lists various diseases such as SARS, avian flu, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus, and matches them up to election years since 2004.\n* However, most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.\n* Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n* While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n* The claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim that every election year has a disease is false. Most of the diseases listed in the claim were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years. While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons. However, the evidence shows that most of the diseases listed in the claim had little to no impact on U.S. elections and were not directly linked to election years.", "response": "FALSE."}

Methods: We conducted a literature search and identified 232 articles; we included 90 after screening. We pulled information from each article using standardized questions for “type of study,” “population,” “specific vaccine,” “reasons for hesitancy,” “hesitancy prevalence,” “attempt at change,” “results of intervention,” and “future interventions.” We created recurrent themes from the data and analyzed these themes via descriptive statistics.\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do give guidance on general approaches to these conversations, keeping up with hard data and multiple studies on various vaccinations can be tedious and is not realistic for many doctors.8,9 · The theme of not enough information is highlighted by more research being cited as the most commonly proposed future intervention.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents.

The proportion of the population that died was 0.29% in the most affected region, Lombardia, and 0.57% in the most affected province, Bergamo. Combining reported test positive rates from Italy with estimates of infection fatality rates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we estimate the infection rate as 29% (95% confidence interval 15–52%) in Lombardy, and 72% (95% confidence interval 36–100%) in Bergamo.\nThis selection only makes a statistically significant difference for the region of Lazio and age groups below 30 years of age in few other regions, but otherwise does not affect our conclusions with any significance. Figure 1 shows a clear excess in mortality over the counterfactual predictions after the week ending on 22 February, when the first COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Italy.\nThis number is similar to the NYC IFR estimated from combining the age-dependent IFR from Italy data, and consistent with a lower bound of 0.49% IFR estimated independently of Italian data—by combining the NYC COVID-19 PFR of 0.286% as of October 2020, with the maximum TPR of 0.58% which was reached in April 2020.

On April 10, there was a total of 147,577 positive cases and 18,849 deaths (Fig. 1) (2,3). An analysis of the sub-set of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 (4) was performed with a sample of 1,453 deaths. This analysis showed that 96.5% of people who died were suffering from one or more pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension (69.9%), diabetes mellitus (31.8%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (28.0%) (5).\nThe most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contacting the infection) in deceased patients in Italy were: hypertension − 73.0%, old diabetes − 31.3%, ischemic heart disease − 27.8%, atrial fibrillation − 23.7%, chronic renal failure − 22.2%, active cancer in the last 5 years − 17.3%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) − 16.7% (26). The existence of pre-existing comorbidities does not mean that COVID-19 infection did not contribute to the death of patients, but it does show that the number of deaths in Italy and elsewhere is increasing as a large proportion of patients had other underlying diseases.\nAn analysis of the sub-set of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 (4) was performed with a sample of 1,453 deaths. This analysis showed that 96.5% of people who died were suffering from one or more pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension (69.9%), diabetes mellitus (31.8%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (28.0%) (5). Deaths were associated with one, two or three co-existing comorbidities in 14.8, 20.7 and 61.0% of cases, respectively.\nAfter the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, when information of its characteristics began arriving in Europe, the Italian Ministry of Health established a task-force group for the coordination of all COVID-19 related issues on 22 January. On 31 January, Italy declared a public health emergency (1). The first cases of positive infections attributed to COVID-19 were confirmed by the Superior Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS) on 30 January, referring to two Chinese tourists already hospitalised from 29 January, in Rome.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-06-04, is a fact-check article by Chequeado discussing a viral video of a speech by Italian MP Vittorio Sgarbi. The MP claimed that 96.3% of people who died from COVID-19 in Italy had other pre-existing diseases. The fact-check article clarifies that this number represents the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus, not that they did not die from COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a preprint study estimating COVID-19 mortality in Italy. The study suggests that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy in 2020 until September 9 was 59,000-62,000, compared to the official number of 36,000. The study also discusses infection rates and infection fatality rates (IFR) in different regions of Italy.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-11-09, is a fact-check article by Reuters addressing false claims about Italy reducing its COVID-19 death toll. The article clarifies that the often-cited figure of 2.9% represents the percentage of COVID-19 deaths with no pre-existing diseases, not the percentage of total COVID-19 deaths.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a study discussing factors related to COVID-19 in Northern Italy. The study analyzes a subset of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 and found that 96.5% of them had one or more pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-30, states that 96.3% of people who died after developing COVID-19 in Italy died from other pathologies. However, the provided information contradicts this claim.\n\nInformation 1 clarifies that the number 96.3% refers to the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus, not that they did not die from COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4 further clarifies that the often-cited figure of 2.9% represents the percentage of COVID-19 deaths with no pre-existing diseases, not the percentage of total COVID-19 deaths.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect and misleading. The percentage 96.3% does not represent the percentage of people who died from other pathologies after developing COVID-19. Instead, it represents the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time. For 2020, the tourism industry and air travel are expected to suffer greatly, and India's GDP growth is expected to decline ∼2.5% from 5.3%.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impacts of India's second COVID-19 wave on children | Coronavirus ...\nContent:\nWith schools closed, parents unable to work and many caregivers who are ill or hospitalised, the second wave of COVID-19 in India is leaving devastating impacts on the emotional and physical well-being of children.

As this new wave sweeps the nation of more than 1 billion, hospitals are running out of oxygen tanks and room to house patients. And the COVID-19 death count keeps climbing, to the point where authorities are holding mass cremations.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: India is experiencing the world's largest COVID-19 surge, with daily cases and deaths increasing rapidly. The government response has been criticized for being weak, and new variants of the virus are thought to be more transmissible. The number of daily deaths is nearing 2,500, and the actual death toll is likely much higher than the official count.\n\nInformation 2: Children in India are reporting a myriad of post-COVID-19 complications, including inflammation in organs and chronic fever. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics reports that 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a serious condition linked to infectious diseases like COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3: India's economy has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the tourism sector expected to have 70% job losses.

The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device.

Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here).

Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body’s ability to fight infection.” · It is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body’s immune system.

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc. The article clarifies that this claim is misleading, as milk does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc. While vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the immune system, no food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus. However, having a healthy diet can support immune function.\n\nInformation 2, published on February 8, 2021, discusses a study by the University of Rochester Medical Center, revealing that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is a study on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in milk. The study found that pasteurization effectively eliminates infectious virus titers in milk.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 28, 2020, states that Chinese researchers found that exposure to human breast milk helps kill the virus that causes Covid-19. The World Health Organization recommends mothers continue breastfeeding even if they have COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, proposes the use of Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not accurate. According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19. However, these findings do not support the claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}
