No, that's not true: An internationally recognized expert in infectious disease epidemiology has quashed those assertions. The claims originated in a post (archived here) published on Facebook by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. It opened: Viruses cannot live in the hot environments. That's why your body raises temperature when you get sick.

Michael Osterholm: Actually, it's great for you. It makes you feel good, but we don't have any evidence that it makes any difference in infectious disease. Joe Rogan: So it doesn't have any impact at all? The idea was that the breathing in of the very hot air, 180 degree air, for 20 minutes will kill some of the virus.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Turning up the heat on COVID-19: heat as a therapeutic intervention ...\nContent:\nThe temperatures achieved within a sauna are well within the range required for pathogen control and often exceed temperatures of 60°C for 30 min, 65°C for 15 min or 80°C for 1 min, which have been shown to reduce coronavirus infectivity by at least 4 log10 ( Kampf et al., 2020). While the temperatures, humidity and times required to specifically deactivate SAR-CoV-2 in vivo are yet to be determined, the temperature within a sauna makes risk of cross infection in public sauna facilities highly unlikely.\nThe heat sensitivity of viruses is used routinely to deactivate viruses within vaccines, and temperatures of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes are reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses ( Darnell et al., 2004; Duan et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2011; Kampf et al., 2020; Lelie et al., 1987; WHO Report, 2003).\n2017;42(1):129–155. 10.1038/npp.2016.148 [PMC free article] [PubMed] [CrossRef] [Google Scholar] Kampf G, Voss A, Scheithauer S: Inactivation of coronaviruses by heat.

We address this below. But the better question is, how about not getting it, or reducing the chances, or even recovering faster rather than looking at an IR Sauna as a means of cure or immunity.\nCoronavirus infectivity was completely lost after 14 days of incubation at 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees F), 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees F), or 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees F) but remained constant at 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 degrees F) for the same length of time. Based on these points alone, it seems a sauna can kill coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna can kill the novel coronavirus. The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Argentina hit 1 million confirmed cases on Monday and Peru and Mexico are expected to reach the grim marker in the weeks ahead. Brazil ranks third worldwide in the number of virus cases and passed 1 million infections back in June.

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China.

Moreover, most of the people who use cannabis also report tobacco use concurrently. This fact may increase the risk of exposure to toxic substances, as certain co-users (for example, blunt users) tend to have higher levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled air and cannabis smoke may have higher levels of some carcinogens than tobacco smoke [7]. Previous studies have indicated that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease [8], metabolic syndromes and changes in the immune system [9].

Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can. Active smokers and vapers both may be at higher risk of health problems from the virus. Also, consider getting vaccinated. There are COVID-19 vaccines available that lessen your chance of infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cannabis and COVID-19\nContent:\nThe BC First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) is the first province-wide health authority of its kind in Canada.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on April 1, 2022, is a study titled \"Cannabis Use Is Associated With Lower COVID-19 Susceptibility but Poorer Survival.\" The study analyzed data from the UK Biobank (UKB) COVID-19 Serology Study and identified 13,099 individuals with a history of cannabis smoking. The study found that cannabis users were more likely to get COVID-19 (odds ratio: 1.22, P = 0.001), but multivariable analysis showed that cannabis use was a protective factor of COVID-19 infection (adjusted odds ratio: 0.81, P = 0.001). However, regular cannabis users who smoked more than once per month had a significantly poorer COVID-19-related survival, after adjusting for known risk factors including age, gender, smoking history, and comorbidity (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.81, P = 0.041).\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not available, is a summary of four important facts currently known about COVID-19 and how it can affect people who smoke or vape cannabis products. The topics covered include the potential impact of smoking or vaping cannabis on lung health, the potential impact on the immune system, how it can have an impact on people infected with COVID-19, and guidance for reducing harms.\n\nInformation 3, published on January 20, 2021, is a study titled \"Multiple clinical risks for cannabis users during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The study discusses the potential risks of cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential for lung injuries similar to COVID-19 symptoms and the potential for increased exposure to toxic substances due to concurrent tobacco use. The study also notes that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease, metabolic syndromes, and changes in the immune system.\n\nInformation 4, published on December 31, 2022, is an article titled \"Coronavirus and Smoking: Risks of Cigarettes, Marijuana, and Vaping.\" The article discusses the potential risks of smoking and vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential for increased ACE2 receptors in the lungs and the potential for secondhand smoke and aerosols from e-cigarettes to carry the virus. The article also notes that active smokers and vapers may be at higher risk of health problems from the virus and encourages people to quit smoking and vaping and consider getting vaccinated.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a page from the BC First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) titled \"Cannabis and COVID-19.\" The page provides information about the potential risks of cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages people to quit smoking and vaping and consider getting vaccinated.\n\nClaim Evaluation:\n\nThe claim that \"smoking cannabis can prevent COVID-19\" is false. The available information shows that cannabis use is associated with a lower susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, but regular cannabis users who smoke more than once per month have a significantly poorer COVID-19-related survival. Additionally, smoking or vaping cannabis can increase the risk of health problems from the virus. The available information does not support the claim that smoking cannabis can prevent COVID-19.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"smoking cannabis can prevent COVID-19\" is not supported by the available information. Information 1, published on April 1, 2022, shows that cannabis use is associated with a lower susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, but regular cannabis users who smoke more than once per month have a significantly poorer COVID-19-related survival. Information 2, Information 3, Information 4 and Information 5 all suggest that smoking or vaping cannabis can increase the risk of health problems from the virus. Therefore, the claim that \"smoking cannabis can prevent COVID-19\" is not supported by the available information and is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic something is, on a scale of 0-14. Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood. The pH of the body is a tightly regulated.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better. But this is because these are, simply put, healthy foods – not because of any changing pH levels in the blood or the body.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2017-06-16\nTitle: NO DISEASE CAN EXIST IN AN ALKALINE ENVIRONMENT — Natural Food ...\nContent:\nThe pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.

It states that the body's pH level is tightly regulated and cannot be significantly altered through diet. The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, with 0-6 being acidic, 7 neutral, and 8-14 basic. The body strives to maintain a pH of 7.365.

Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide protection against contagion.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. In fact, the information suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments.

Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19. Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as effective against COVID-19, despite there being no conclusive proof.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, without specified publication dates, mention that President Trump said he consulted with the White House doctor before taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-05-21, states that President Trump told reporters he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, the unproven drug he had touted for COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-04-24, earlier than the provided information. The claim states that Trump spoke with the President of Honduras, who mentioned the incredible results of using hydroxychloroquine in Honduras. Since the claim's publication date is earlier than the provided information, the focus should be on whether Trump had any interactions with hydroxychloroquine or discussions about its effectiveness before the claim's publication date.\n\nBased on the available information, there is no direct evidence to confirm or deny the claim that Trump discussed hydroxychloroquine with the President of Honduras before 2020-04-24. However, considering Trump's subsequent promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure and his touting of its effectiveness, it is plausible that Trump might have had early conversations about hydroxychloroquine with other world leaders.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]].

According to the Coroners Court of Victoria, there were 49 suicides in Victoria during September 2020. While the number of suicides in Victoria for the whole of 2019 is not explicitly stated in the information provided, it is highly unlikely that the monthly rate for September 2020 is equivalent to the annual rate for the entire year of 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that there are 125 suicides per week in Victoria alone, compared to 56 suicides per week in Australia before COVID-19, is also misleading. The provided information states that there were 3,046 deaths by suicide in Australia in 2018, which translates to approximately 58 suicides per week.

Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.

Several practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported.\nSeveral practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported. These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.\nThe time elapsed since the last COVID-19 vaccination may need to be considered when invasive procedures are required.

The articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.”\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others shows the vaccines boost the immune response. The mRNA vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, allowing it to generate an immune response, experts say.\nThe articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.” · But that’s not at all what the research shows, according to the Francis Crick Institute’s Dr. David Bauer, one of the study’s authors. “Our work to date has not studied T cells at all,” Bauer told the AP in an email. “All research published to date shows that the Pfizer (and other) vaccines generate a strong, positive, protective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2.” · Outside experts confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy or damage T cells.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-15, is a fact-check by Maldita.es stating that there has been no discovery that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-27, discusses a study that found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 and then vaccinated had lower levels of CD8 cells, a type of T cell, compared to those who were vaccinated and had not been infected. However, this study does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, discusses the adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them. It mentions that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of Covid-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals. However, this information does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-12-13, is an article addressing false claims made by a British funeral director about Covid-19 vaccines weakening the immune system and stopping the body's ability to fight off the Omicron variant. The article explains that studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines boost the immune response and that the claim that the vaccine destroys T cells or weakens the immune system is false.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is an article addressing false claims that a study from the Francis Crick Institute shows that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine \"destroys T cells\" and \"weakens the immune system.\" The article explains that the study did not examine T cells and that outside experts have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines do not destroy or damage T cells.\n\nIn summary, all of the provided information contradicts the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.

Most states have already lifted or announced plans to lift their indoor mask mandates, but the CDC's recommendation may persuade any remaining holdouts, who may have been unwilling to ease mitigation measures until the agency gave its stamp of approval. It may also encourage some states or districts that have been reluctant to end mask mandates in schools.\nHowever, the prevalence of BA.2 has not risen dramatically so far, according to CDC data. \"We will have to remain alert globally to the possibility of a new variant occurring somewhere in the world coming here,\" Schaffner said. \"But I think we can move into a new normal.\" Walensky noted that the guidance could still change in the future. \"We want to give people a break from things like mask wearing when levels are low, and then have the ability to reach for them again should things get worse in the future,\" she said.\nIt's a dramatic shift from the previous guidance, which recommended masks in counties with substantial or high transmission, a category that covered the vast majority of the country. The recommendations apply to everyone, not just those who are vaccinated or have received a booster shot. CDC Director Dr.\nAlthough masks have been required in many school districts around the country, the CDC is including schools in the new guidance because children are at lower risk for severe illness, Massetti said. The agency only recommends universal mask use in schools in communities at the high risk level.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-07-30\nTitle: Timeline: CDC mask guidelines during the COVID pandemic - Los Angeles ...\nContent:\nRochelle Walensky, the CDC’s new director.

The agency also says that people should defer to local guidelines. California, for example, waits until June 15 to lift masking requirements for vaccinated people in most public places. With the highly transmissible Delta variant fueling yet another increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, the CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in parts of the U.S. where the coronavirus is surging.\nSince then, government and public health leaders have urged us to wear face masks even when walking around our neighborhoods alone, and told us to keep wearing them even after receiving the protection of highly effective vaccines. It wasn’t until May that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told fully vaccinated Americans that they could be exempt from nearly all mask requirements. The state of California followed suit with rules that went into effect when the economy reopened on June 15. ...

Now, the CDC says facilities in regions without high transmission can “choose not to require” all doctors, patients, and visitors to mask.\nNow, the CDC says facilities in regions without high transmission can “choose not to require” all doctors, patients, and visitors to mask.
