The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas.

Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23. Panta Gopal & Richardson Ann & Shaw Ian. Effectiveness of autoclaving in sterilizing reusable medical devices in healthcare facilities.\nSeveral studies have shown the effects of different sterilization methods, including gamma sterilization, plasma sterilization, steam and dry heat sterilization, microwaves, washing machines and UV–C light, as methods to decontaminate face masks for reuse [9–13]. These studies suggest that gamma and steam sterilization conducted at 134°C damage the microstructure of the filter material [9].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can Disposable Face Masks Be Reused? | Primo Dental Products\nContent:\nAll that considered, it’s only the right time to ask the question: can disposable face masks be reused? And if so, how can you reuse them properly? In this article, we will talk about which face masks can be reused, the proper way to sterilize and reuse your face mask, and what to do with your disposable face masks after you reuse them for the final time.\nAll these instances aside, it may be possible to reuse your disposable mask safely. This brings us to our next topic: Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them.\nCan disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them. It is not necessary to douse your disposable mask in rubbing alcohol or disinfectant. In fact, treating your face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\nIn healthcare settings, disposable face masks cannot be reused. For general protection against COVID-19, on the other hand, it is possible to sterilize and reuse face masks.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study was conducted to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks for reuse. The masks were sterilized using a 15-minute procedure at 121 ºC with both dry and regular steam processes in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes was sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus. After sterilization, the samples were tested and benchmarked with new mouth masks.\n\nInformation 2: A rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides, and other information available online was conducted to identify the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks and the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization. The most promising methods for disinfection are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat, and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave, or steam are not fully recommended.\n\nInformation 3: A discussion on the feasibility of sterilization and reuse of disposable dust masks was conducted. Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Moreover, most of the people who use cannabis also report tobacco use concurrently. This fact may increase the risk of exposure to toxic substances, as certain co-users (for example, blunt users) tend to have higher levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled air and cannabis smoke may have higher levels of some carcinogens than tobacco smoke [7]. Previous studies have indicated that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease [8], metabolic syndromes and changes in the immune system [9]. In this sense, when compared to the general population, we can consider that this population may be more vulnerable to infection morbidity and mortality.\nCOVID-19 risk and outcomes in patients with substance use disorders: analyses from electronic health records in the United States.

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can. Active smokers and vapers both may be at higher risk of health problems from the virus. Also, consider getting vaccinated.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage.

The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China.

It discusses the rise of the gambling industry in the country and the impact it has had on the local population.\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China is likely false. Information 1, which was published on the same day as the claim, states that there is no evidence to support this claim and suggests that it is not accurate to compare Macedonia to China in this way. Additionally, the other information provided does not support the claim, as it focuses on the coronavirus situation in North Macedonia and the gambling industry in the country.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to classify the claim as FALSE based on the available information and the lack of evidence to support it.", "response": "FALSE."}

The man in the video inhales and exhales through two different surgical masks, a cupped mask, a cloth mask, a mask with filter material and a respirator with a valve.\n“I am disappointed that a licensed physician would use smoke as an equivalent comparison,” said Hogue, although as noted above, Noel’s license has expired. Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in aerosols, said in an email: “I consider that video disinformation because they clearly don’t know what they are doing with that test.” · The effectiveness of masks in limiting the potential spread of coronavirus has been extensively documented.\nA YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free. We discuss this issue in Section 7.2.

The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false.
