Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Uganda suggest that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t has been lower than 1.0 since July 2021.\nOn 22 March, the first case of COVID-19 in Uganda was confirmed. The confirmed case was a 36-year-old male who had travelled to Dubai on 17 March 2020 for a business trip. On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.\nOne person posted on Facebook that no medical officer had visited the hotel and that staff frequently entered and left the premises and worked without protective gear.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport. The information also highlights the testing strategy in Uganda, which tests all incoming travelers from high-risk countries, and the young age of most case-persons in Uganda.\n\nInformation 2 offers more context about Uganda's initial testing strategy, emphasizing the high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda. The information also highlights the risk posed by porous borders and the importance of strict border security and screening interventions.\n\nInformation 3 is a Wikipedia entry about the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda, including the confirmation of the first case on March 22, 2020, and the individual's travel history. The information also notes that Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nInformation 4 is a Reuters article from June 2021 about Uganda re-imposing a strict lockdown due to a surge in COVID-19 cases.

The Minister of Defence and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff are permanent members of the National Security Council. With Ceylon gaining independence in 1948, the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence was formed to administer the country's armed forces and formulate defence and foreign policy.\nThe Ministry of Defence (Sinhala: රාජ්‍ය ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යාංශය Rājya ārakshaka amāthyanshaya; Tamil: பாதுகாப்பு அமைச்சகம்) is the cabinet ministry of the Government of Sri Lanka responsible for implementation of government defence policy and acts as the overall headquarters of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defence states that its principal objectives are the formulation, co-ordination and the execution of policies in relation to the national security. With the end of the Cold War, the MOD does not foresee any short-term conventional military threat, the main threat to Sri Lanka having been the now-defunct organization, the LTTE and Islamic Terrorism.\nWith Ceylon gaining independence in 1948, the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence was formed to administer the country's armed forces and formulate defence and foreign policy. The Prime Minister was also the Minister of Defence and External Affairs, and was supported by a Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and External Affairs who was a member of Parliament. In 1977, J.R Jayawardena's government adapted two separate ministries, forming the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were formed. Since then many presidents retained the portfolio of Minister of Defence under him/her self, except for a few brief periods.\nSince the establishment of the MoD in 1978 the portfolio of Minister of Defence was held by the President of Sri Lanka, except for a few brief periods .

Additionally, Information 4 mentions that the National Pay Commission advises the Government on national salaries and wages policy, including for the Armed Forces, so any changes to their pay would likely come from that body rather than the Ministry of Defense.", "response": "FALSE."}

Although the performance of these products is most commonly defined as a function of their alcohol concentration, they are multifaceted products in which an interplay of several factors is important in determining efficacy.\nPreventative measures for minimizing ocular exposure while using ABHS have been proposed [92]. The high use of ABHS during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been reported to be a possible cause of disulfiram alcohol reactions [93,94]. However, it has been proposed that inadvertent inhalation (especially if ABHS are used in poorly ventilated areas) rather than topical absorption is more likely to result in high enough amounts of alcohol exposure to elicit a disulfiram reaction [95].\nKeywords: hand sanitizers, alcohol, hand hygiene, tetrahedron, antiseptic, COVID-19 · Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have emerged as an important tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1].

For instance, the early understanding of the mask functions was limited especially in the escalating phase of the COVID 19 pandemic, resulting in quite controversial remarks on masks.\nThis review provides the most up‐to‐date information on the transmission modes of COVID‐19 virus in terms of droplets and aerosols. The roles of masks in disease prevention and transmission reduction are evaluated on various types, structures and functions. More important, both aspects of exhalation isolation and inhalation protection are discussed based on virus transmission modes and the effectiveness of different types of masks under varied environmental conditions. ... Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), the world has seen waves of coronavirus that have devastated many regions and countries.\nOne major disagreement lied on the necessary requirement of mask wearing in the public places especially for those who are not infected with COVID‐19.

However, differences in underlying health conditions among Black and Asian people, obtained from primary care records, were able to explain only a quarter of the excess deaths from COVID-19.[2]\nCOVID-19 patients who are admitted to critical care or who die in hospital include a disproportionately large number of people from ethnic minorities.[1][2] In the UK, one in three patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 has been from an ethnic minority group, although they make up only one in eight of the UK population.[3] The excess risk of severe COVID-19 to people from ethnic minorities is visible not only in hospital admissions, but also in the community. In a national cohort of 6 million veterans in the USA, Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested and to test positive for COVID-19 than Whites.[4] In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysed all deaths in England and Wales with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nPeople in ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with higher exposure to coronavirus infection, which could result in more cases of COVID-19.[1] On the other hand, ethnic minority populations tend to be younger on average than the UK population, and younger people are less susceptible to severe illness following infection. The total numbers of deaths recorded in hospitals are similar per capita for Black African and White ethnic groups.\nThe difference was particularly large for Black men and women, who were more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 than White men and women.[5] Can these differences be explained in terms of exposure to coronavirus infection, or susceptibility to severe illness and death following infection, or both?\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds are more likely to die ...\nContent:\nAfter adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian backgrounds were 1.49 times more likely to die compared to those from white backgrounds, and patients from black backgrounds were 1.30 times more likely to die.

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false. The information indicates that dryers are not effective at killing all germs and viruses, and there is no mention of using a hairdryer for sterilization purposes. Additionally, the information about hairdryer usage is related to styling hair, not sterilization. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

An important factor driving this variation is uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 in Africa5. Across sub-Saharan Africa, most countries lack vital registration systems and only South Africa contributed national mortality data to these models; the estimates of deaths in all other countries were extrapolated from mortality patterns observed elsewhere.\nWe analysed 16,177 deaths occurring between 1st Jan 2010 and 5th May 2022 from among 3,330,071 PYO.

The study found an overall excess mortality rate of 4.8% (95% PI 1.2%, 9.4%) during 5 waves of COVID-19. The age-standardized excess mortality rate for January 2020-December 2021 was 27.4/100,000 person-years (95% CI 23.2-31.6).

Scabies is, or should be, routinely considered in the framework of screening patients at risk for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nWhile the major focus of HIV/AIDS research is on humans, comparative approaches encompassing the primate lentiviruses and their hosts as a whole are desirable. In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection.

By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it. However, there is a problem with letting private and for-profit companies charge different prices from different customers. These are the prices fixed by Serum Institute of India (SII) for the Covishield vaccine:\nBy allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities. “Pricing should be uniform.

Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. Private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose.\n\nInformation 3 is a repetition of Information 1.\n\nInformation 4, published after the claim, discusses the debate around the high prices of the Covishield vaccine and the argument that the vaccine should be free for all.

However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context. The claim should have specified that the vaccine is free of cost in public healthcare facilities in India, but not necessarily in private healthcare facilities.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. This information is from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making it a reliable source. Additionally, Information 5, also published after the claim, supports the fact that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, further emphasizing the importance of specifying the cost of the vaccine in private healthcare facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020). Human activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).\nHuman activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). The pandemic has caused reduced air pollution as public mobility is halted, airlines being shut down, and other highway transportation being canceled, which gives us the opportunity to breathe in a low carbon air (Monks 2020, April 20).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The world faces an air pollution 'pandemic' | EurekAlert ...\nContent:\nProfessors Jos Lelieveld and Thomas Münzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Department of Cardiology of the University Medical Centre Mainz in Mainz, Germany, who led the research, say the findings suggest the world is facing an air pollution \"pandemic\".

The Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 was the most severe pandemic in recent history, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With “genes of avian origin”, the virus infected an estimated 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population and killed around 50 million people.\nThe flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ... As the race to find a COVID-19 vaccine continues, a Facebook post highlights a pandemic more than a century ago to warn of the ill effects of vaccines. The post features an image of a giant glowing syringe above rows of hospital beds and reads, “The 1918 Spanish Flu did not kill 50,000,000 people!\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Purple Death: The Great Flu of 1918 - PAHO/WHO | Pan American Health ...\nContent:\nThe microscopic killer circled the entire globe in four months, claiming the lives of more than 21 million people. The United States lost 675,000 people to the Spanish flu in 1918-more casualties than World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined. Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I. Estimates of the number of deaths from the pandemic range from 21 million to 50 million worldwide.

While we’ve had a century to study influenza, our understanding of COVID-19 is just beginning to take shape, says Amit Srivastava, PhD, a Senior Director in Vaccines Medical Affairs at Pfizer, and the lead in Emerging Markets (Latin America, Africa & Middle East, Asia & China) for COVID-19 and mRNA vaccines.\nWhile we’ve had a century to study influenza, our understanding of COVID-19 is just beginning to take shape, says Amit Srivastava, PhD, a Senior Director in Vaccines Medical Affairs at Pfizer, and the lead in Emerging Markets (Latin America, Africa & Middle East, Asia & China) for COVID-19 and mRNA vaccines. “We have only known SARS-CoV-2 since 2019,” he says. “So the certainty with which some people, including scientists, talk about what we understand about the virus and what it is doing is a bit disconcerting to me.” · The 1918 flu pandemic did most of its damage in three waves that occurred in the spring, fall, and winter of 1918.\nAt least 50 million died, with 675,000 deaths occurring in the U.S.1 · Today, the COVID-19 pandemic is frequently compared with the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. The destruction caused by that pandemic a century ago may sound familiar. Yet, direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, according to one scientist.\n“We’re talking about young individuals who were in a congregate setting at a time when vaccination overall was not that prevalent,” he says. “We didn’t fully know about disease spread as much. We knew about hygiene but didn’t understand that with a highly transmissible virus, basic sanitation measures such as hand washing weren’t going to cover you.” · Had certain conditions that occurred during the 1918 flu pandemic been replicated a century later, Srivastava suggests, we might have seen a greater impact of COVID-19 on young adults.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-03, states that the 1918 flu pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, killed more than 50 million people worldwide. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population was infected. At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this flu strain. Social distancing measures were implemented, such as closing schools, theaters, churches, and businesses, as well as requiring the use of masks and setting up makeshift morgues.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2010-10-12, provides a detailed account of the Spanish flu pandemic. It killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States. The pandemic was caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, which was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. There were no vaccines or effective treatments available at the time.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-07-17, clarifies that vaccines were not available during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, as the flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s. The post warns of the ill effects of vaccines, but this information is inaccurate.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, states that pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine for the Spanish flu, but they were too late as the virus disappeared before they could isolate it.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, mentions that direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, as our understanding of COVID-19 is still developing.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-07-26, states that vaccines killed 50 million people during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. However, the provided information and existing knowledge indicate that vaccines were not available during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s, which is after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic occurred. Therefore, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Morandi tried to manoeuvre but the vessel was boarded by hundreds of invaders, in which he ordered that the vessel to be set on fire. He was later killed by rain of hostile bullets. However, all on board were eventually mutilated and killed. On 8 March 1799, General Belliard led his forces to fight 3,000 Meccan Infantry and 350 Mamluks in the plain of Abnud, located on the right bank of the Nile to the south of Qena.\nNevertheless, Egypt became a topic of debate between Talleyrand and Napoleon, which continued in their correspondence during Napoleon's Italian campaign. In early 1798, Bonaparte proposed an expedition to Egypt and convinced the Directory to establish the Commission des Sciences et des Arts.\nAccording to a 13 February report by Talleyrand, \"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send force from Suez to the Sultanate of Mysore, to join the forces of Tipu Sultan and drive away the English.\" The Directory agreed to the plan in March, though troubled by its scope and cost.\nBonaparte had been informed that Murad Bey had evaded the pursuit by Generals Desaix, Belliard, Donzelot and Davout and was descending on Lower Egypt. Bonaparte thus marched to attack him at Giza, also learning that 100 Ottoman ships were off Aboukir, threatening Alexandria.\nThe French campaign in Egypt and Syria (1798–1801) was a Napoleonic campaign in the Ottoman territories of Egypt and Syria, executed by Napoleon Bonaparte.

Recently, a team of investigators affiliated with the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial — called Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment, Investigating Outpatients Nationwide, or ACTION for short — will involve human participants, and the researchers started recruiting on May 26, 2020.\nProctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future. Lastly, standard guidelines for the administration of the antibiotics must be established.\nBeović B, Dousak M, Ferreira-Coimbra J, et al.

Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have been analyzed for their potential capacity to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro, blocking replication [19]. Furthermore, beta-lactam antibiotics are being evaluated in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but more clinical trials are necessary in order to properly evaluate results [20].

They are medications that are useful in treating bacterial infections and not viral infections. And COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2, is a viral infection that can cause mild disease that where patients remain at home in the communities, or it can lead to moderate or severe disease where patients are admitted to the hospital.

There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

This has been debunked by Information 1, which provides evidence that the picture is from 2018. Additionally, Information 2 supports this conclusion by mentioning that Reuters had previously debunked a false claim about Gates and Fauci not wearing masks.\n\nInformation 3, 4, and 5 provide context about the collaboration between Gates and Fauci on Covid efforts, Gates' concerns about anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories, and their roles during the pandemic.

In all countries, there were sharp increases at the beginning of the pandemic, and again in late 2020 and early 2021. Scotland and Northern Ireland registered their highest proportion of weekly deaths in care homes involving COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic (week 18 2020: Scotland 49.4%; Northern Ireland 50.0%). England registered their highest proportion in early 2021 (week 4 2021, 48.9%), as did Wales (week 3 2021, 58.4%).\nThe Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) weekly provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland includes all deaths with coronavirus (COVID-19) mentioned on the death certificate. Figures presented on the latest insights tool are different from the daily surveillance figures on COVID-19 deaths published by the Department of Health and Social Care, which provide daily and cumulative deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive test.\nThere were 619 deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK in the latest week (ending 17 March 2023). This is a rise from 605 in the previous week. Of these, 512 were registered in England, 47 in Wales, 56 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland. A total of 13,683 deaths were registered in the UK in the week ending 17 March 2023, which was 9.3% above the five-year average. In the same week, deaths involving COVID-19 accounted for 4.5% of all deaths in the UK, compared with 4.6% in the previous week.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality - statistics - Statistics Explained\nContent:\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of the EU; however, its impact was not evenly spread. The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nData from Ireland were not included in the first phase of the excess mortality release: official timely data were not available because deaths in Ireland can be registered up to three months after the date of death. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.

They both debunk the claim that COVID-19 death tolls in Ireland, England, and Italy have been miscalculated and inflated. The information points out that the claim was made on Facebook without any source and is false. Italy did not miscalculate their death toll by 90%, and the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar did not confirm that Ireland's statistics are inflated. England did lower their official count by some 5,000, but that was due to a change in its classification of deaths related to the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3 is from a publication in 2023-03-27, which provides the latest insights on COVID-19 deaths in the UK.

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.

The stockpile is running low. The Trump administration admits it. And no, this is not the states’ fault. But it’s not entirely clear what will happen when it’s emptied out.\nThe Strategic National Stockpile, like the nuclear arsenal, is something government officials hoped they would never need to use. Formed in 1999 as anxiety over Y2K mounted, this federal stockpile was designed to prevent an interruption to hospital supply chains, if all the computers ended up melting down on New Year’s Eve. That never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security.\nThat never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security. If a bioweapon struck an American city, for example, officials could quickly access vaccines and antitoxins to fight back against nerve agents or diseases like smallpox.\nSince then, the office of the Strategic National Stockpile has been preparing for the next outbreak, though no one knew when or what it would be. With an annual budget of about $600 million, the stockpile has maintained a large supply of personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, face shields, and surgical gowns, as well as medical equipment like the ventilators that hospitals so urgently need now to treat Covid-19 patients.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-06\nTitle: Depleted National Stockpile Contributed to COVID PPE Shortage: ‘You\nContent:\nWhen asked why the SNS didn’t receive appropriations for fully replacing the stockpile following H1N1, he says: “You’d really have to ask the Congress.” · As the documentary finds, sources both inside and outside the government had raised alarms, pre-COVID, about leaving the nation and its front-line health care workers without a PPE safety net.\nOver seven months of interviewing manufacturers and government officials, analyzing records and tracking key medical supplies, AP investigative reporters Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza, along with producer Peter Klein of the Global Reporting Centre and his team, found missed opportunities to prevent that failure stretching across several presidential administrations — including chances to invest in domestic manufacturing rather than relying on supplies made in China, as well as neglecting to substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. Intended as a fallback for covering medical-equipment needs in times of crises, the SNS is a set of government-run warehouses filled with medical supplies, such as ventilators and N95 respirator masks. The Obama administration distributed those supplies on a mass scale during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. “During H1N1, we sent out personal protective equipment that we had stocked for a pandemic influenza event, ahead of a great deal o\n\"America’s Medical Supply Crisis,\" a new documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Global Reporting Centre, examines missed opportunities to fend off a deadly PPE shortage.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-02\nTitle: Coronavirus: Protective gear in national stockpile is nearly ...\nContent:\nHe also said large amounts of PPE were being shipped directly from manufacturers to hospitals. But the DHS officials said the stockpile has not been able to handle the load. President Trump said on March 28 that the United States will “absolutely” have enough ventilators in wake of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the shortage.\nThe government has long viewed the national stockpile supplies as a holdover during an emergency so the government could buy time for manufacturers to boost output and for new supply chains to solidify, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.\nAs coronavirus hot spots flare from coast to coast, the demand for safety equipment — also known as personal protective equipment (PPE) — is both immediate and widespread, with health officials, hospital executives and governors saying that their shortages are critical and that health-care workers are putting their lives at risk while trying to help the surging number of patients. Two DHS officials said the stores kept in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Strategic National Stockpile are nearly gone.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-23, discusses the issues with PPE production and how the US is unable to meet its goals of filling the Strategic National Stockpile. The production of nitrile gloves, the industry standard for protection, is almost exclusively sourced from Asia, leading to a global shortage.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-10, reveals that the Strategic National Stockpile is running low on PPE, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, gowns, and other medical supplies.

This claim is supported by Information 2, also published on 2020-04-10, which reveals that the Strategic National Stockpile has distributed 90% of its PPE and is sending out all its remaining inventory.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

Its dissemination, however, does tell us an awful lot about a screwed-up media system that allows unscrupulous companies and individuals to spread misinformation. The original press release from 5WPR notes that in a survey of 737 beer-drinking Americans, 38 percent said they “would not buy Corona under any circumstances now.” By presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans’ reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus.\nHave you heard that 38 percent of Americans won’t drink Corona beer, because they are afraid of contracting the coronavirus? For the past hours, this finding has spread across the internet like wildfire (or, more apt, a dangerous disease). CNN, the New York Post, and Vice all wrote up the poll.

The first-ever national state of emergency was decreed on October 25, 2020, primarily to introduce a curfew from midnight until six in the morning in order to tackle the widespread between young people in social gatherings. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court of Spain ruled that both COVID states of alarm had been unconstitutional.\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose. Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur. The state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published in 2018, refers to a video of a deer and 12 dogs falling off a cliff, which caused outrage on social media in Spain.\n* Information 2, published in 2020, mentions a video of a deer on a beach that has been circulating online since 2015, with claims that it was filmed in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown, or in Sri Lanka or India during their lockdowns.\n* Information 3, published in 2020, is a Royal Decree declaring the state of alarm in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which allows the government to adopt measures to tackle the pandemic and report to the Congress of Deputies.\n* Information 4, no publication date, refers to a video of a deer and 12 dogs falling into a ravine, which caused outrage on social media in Spain.\n* Information 5, published in 2023, states that the state of alarm declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic was unconstitutional, and it was the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a video of a deer in the sea was recorded during the state of alarm decree in Spain is false. The video mentioned in the claim is likely the same video referred to in Information 1 and 4, which shows a deer and 12 dogs falling into a ravine, not a deer in the sea. Furthermore, the video has been circulating online since 2015, which predates the state of alarm decree in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Facebook meme (Information 4) uses Wells's image to make a morbid joke but does not reflect the media's reporting.

Lockdowns and school closures had a serious impact on children’s development. Keeping children indoors kept them safe from COVID-19. But it also robbed them of critical experiences that help them develop. As children navigate life beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, parents should watch out for a few possible scenarios:\nIf they are having trouble thinking clearly, they should have an evaluation more focused on neurology. In most cases, children recover from long COVID within a few months. But for some children, it can take a long time to feel better. During this time, it’s important that parents keep an eye on their child’s mental health.\nCountless children in South Asia have lost loved ones and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. And if children have never been exposed to death before, facing loss for the first time can be as confusing as it is upsetting. There is no ‘correct’ way to grieve, and no specific stages in which different emotions or behaviours should appear.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-07-31\nTitle: The Big Read in short: Covid-19 fallout spells trouble for ...\nContent:\nThe mental health of students is in the spotlight following an alleged murder at River Valley High School which shook the nation · The Covid-19 pandemic and reduced interactions in school have exacerbated perennial stress factors · Some teachers and parents say they’ve noticed children becoming more subdued and withdrawn, and counsellors warn of a prolonged impact on students’ mental health\nApart from coping with perennial stressors of the educational system and growing up in the social-media age, students in the past 17 months and counting have had to deal with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. And this presents a formidable challenge for some, said counsellors, teachers, parents and students interviewed. While TODAY’s interviews found that parents and students are becoming more aware of mental well-being counsellors said that one perennial problem remains: The stigma attached to children’s mental health issues, especially among parents.\nWhile TODAY’s interviews found that parents and students are becoming more aware of mental well-being counsellors said that one perennial problem remains: The stigma attached to children’s mental health issues, especially among parents. ... Statistics provided by Mr Chan, in a written parliamentary response separate from his ministerial statement, showed that the incidence of suicide among young people aged 10 to 19 rose last year, compared with 2019, as part of an overall increase in people here taking their own lives during the pandemic.\nCounsellors said that the restricted interactions with others due to Covid-19 safe distancing measures have exacerbated mental health issues faced by children here. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to TODAY’s queries that the number of students who have seen or have been referred to their school counsellors for social, emotional or mental health issues has remained “largely stable” over the last few years. Since the pandemic started early last year, students have gone through several periods of home-based learning (HBL), and have to abide by strict safe distancing measures in schools, such as sitting individually and apart in classrooms.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-05-22\nTitle: Lessons learned from COVID-19: how did the pandemic affect ...\nContent:\nCountries can continue to encourage healthy choices through laws that make fruits and vegetables more affordable, and by imposing taxes on sugary drinks and creating health promotion campaigns.  · “Not only is home-cooked food often healthier, it can also be less expensive, which is important for families in the current environment, when many people need to find ways to cut costs in their household expenses,” added Dr Wickramasinghe. Unfortunately, the pandemic also presented new challenges for children.\nThirty per cent of children became less physically active during this period, missing out on the health benefits of activities such as cycling, playing football or running around in the park.  · In addition, during the lockdown period over 35% of children spent more time watching television, playing video games or using social media, increasing their sedentary time, thus putting themselves at greater risk of becoming overweight and obese, and increasing their exposure to marketing of unhealthy products via digital media.\nThese data provide invaluable insights into the consequences – both good and bad – of the pandemic and the effects it had on children. This is one of the largest studies of its kind, and the lessons learned can help countries to plan for future emergencies and pandemics. “The lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of implementing effective policies to improve food environments, encourage physical activity, and protect the health and well-being of families.\nLockdowns, restrictions, and emergency policies have changed our diets, physical activity patterns and many other daily habits that are tightly connected to our well-being. Data from a new WHO/Europe factsheet enable us to assess both positive and negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health across the WHO European Region, with a special focus on school-aged children.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth\nContent:\nIn kids, the most common symptoms include tiredness, trouble breathing, chest pain, or belly pain.

The first to use the nutrigenomics approach for COVID-19 to find an answer, the scientists concluded that food habits and food ingredients probably played an important role, besides vaccination and other measures in reducing the severity and high death rate in Indians.\nOne idli may contain twice the zinc than most commonly used zinc-supplemented vitamin tablets. Additionally, the Indian vegetarian diets are rich in fibre that prevents CO2 and LPS-mediated COVID-19 severity. Catechins present in tea act as natural cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin,” the study said.\nFinally, they correlated these variables with observed death rates and performed in-depth comparative pathways and nutrigenomics-based analyses of blood transcriptomes of asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients from these two groups of populations.

Indigenous nations' own codes and policies can be instituted to bolster this response, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US (Hiraldo et al., 2021).\nIn Australia, there are early indications of establishing regional data infrastructure so Indigenous nations can use data for development (National Agreement on Closing the Gap, 2020). One policy proposal to assist in the current COVID-19 environment for Indigenous communities to respond to COVID-19 is to invest in technological solutions such as a syndromic surveillance system for Indigenous community-controlled/based data systems where there are options to do so, and appropriate Indigenous data governance can be applied.\nData sharing involves both the release of tribal information as well as the sharing of tribal information that other governments hold, such as COVID-19 related data, with tribes. A number of states and the federal government have denied tribal rights to access data for decision-making (Tahir and Cancryn, 2020). There is a recognized need for other governments and organizations to establish data sharing agreements and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples (Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Indigenous Data Working Group, 2020; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).\nThe United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2020); World Health Organization (2020), and the Pan American Health Organization (del Pino and Camacho, 2020) call for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data (direct and indirect) and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples. In the US, there has been a call for the availability of data disaggregated by Indigenous nations and tribal affiliation themselves, with the caveat that this must be done within the context of Indigenous governance of those data, including data sharing agreements (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous Communities in Canada | The Health ...\nContent:\nPurpose: The purpose of this literature review was to explore the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. Methods: A literature review was conducted in June 2021. An infographic was created after a review of the literature.

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive. This indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\nThis indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets. However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%. Also read: What You Need to Know Before Trying to Make Sense of Sero-Survey Results · However, the researchers cautioned that four of the 15 districts in the survey (and out of 233 such districts in India, per the paper) with ‘zero cases’ didn’t have COVID-19 testing laboratories at the district headquarters and that samples collected in the area for tests had to be transported to state-headquarter hospitals.\n“The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas,” the researchers conclude. On July 10, PTI had reported that ICMR would conduct “a nationwide seroprevalence survey to determine the exposure of the novel coronavirus among the population … as a follow-up” to the one conducted in May-June.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is the official website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.\n\nInformation 2 is about a study conducted by ICMR that found that Indian food habits and ingredients, such as idli, rajma, zinc, fiber, and catechins present in tea, may have played an important role in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India. The study compared transcriptome profiles of COVID-19 patients from south India (Karnataka) and north India (Haryana) with those of Western populations.\n\nInformation 3 is about the importance of data sharing and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous nations' own codes and policies, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US. The information also highlights the need for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples.\n\nInformation 4 is a literature review of the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. The review found that many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. However, Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nInformation 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey. The survey found that 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive, indicating that India's COVID-19 epidemic had spread to rural parts despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\n\nClaim: As per ICMR study there’s been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. Information 2 is an ICMR study that focused on the role of food habits and ingredients in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them. Information 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them.

The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 113,000 deaths, in mid-June, as state governments considered how to prevent the spread of the disease in schools once a vaccine is available.\nBut a meme circulating on Facebook and other versions on social media claim the bill does not give parents any opportunity to avoid vaccinations for their children. “My heart is with Colorado!” the meme reads. “They passed bill SB-163 removing exemptions for vaccines. Very horrendous bill. Students must take Flu, HPV AND COVID19 vaccine to attend school.” The HPV vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus. That’s wrong on several counts. First, the bill has not become law yet. As we noted, the current version must still be approved by the Colorado Senate and then be signed by the governor.\nIt is also not true that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines or that “students must take” vaccines “to attend school.” · Colorado state law currently requires any student under 18 to submit a certificate of immunization, a doctor-certified medical exemption, or a statement of religious or personal belief that bars immunization. The new bill makes no changes as to who can choose to exempt their children and does not take away the opportunity to claim an exemption based on “a religious belief whose teachings are opposed to immunizations or a personal belief that is opposed to immunizations.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vaccine exemptions | Department of Public Health & Environment\nContent:\nColorado law requires all students attending Colorado schools and licensed child cares to be vaccinated against certain diseases unless they have a certificate of medical or nonmedical exemption on file. You must file a certificate of exemption at each school, or child care the student attends. To protect unvaccinated children, students with an exemption from one or more required vaccines may be kept out of a school or child care during a disease outbreak.\nYou can complete this form for multiple children, by selecting the 'back' button and resubmitting the nonmedical exemption each time it appears. IMPORTANT: Certificates of Nonmedical Exemption expire each year on June 30th. If you submit a Certificate of nonmedical exemption on or before June 30th, it will not be valid for the upcoming school year unless you submit the Certificate during early registration. Parents of students in preschool or child care must submit nonmedical exemptions at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 months of age.\nParents of students in grades K-12 claiming a nonmedical exemption must submit one annually.

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9].

Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a significant correlation between PTSD and BOS, and that the pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma, increasing PTSD among HCWs.\n\nInformation 3, published on March 2, 2022, discusses a study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration that explores the connection between nurses' practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The study aims to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions for nursing staff members.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of preventing PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. It also outlines the symptoms of PTSD according to ICD-10 and DSM-5.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, focuses on factors associated with PTSD in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in South Korea. The study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that \"PTSD can strike nurses, especially during COVID-19\" is supported by all the provided information. The correlation between PTSD and the COVID-19 pandemic among nurses is evident in Information 2 and 5. Information 3 further highlights the importance of addressing PTSD in nurses during the pandemic, and Information 4 emphasizes the need for preventive and management strategies for PTSD in HCWs. Therefore, the claim is considered TRUE based on the available information and the understanding of PTSD and its relationship to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "TRUE."}

The data tells a different story.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge 'Only' Due to Testing, Misleads ...\nContent:\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February. New coronavirus booster: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone 6 months or older get an updated coronavirus shot, but the vaccine rollout has seen some hiccups, especially for children.\nNo one thinks that anywhere near half the state’s population had covid-19 at that time, so those results would imply that testing was overly focused on a subset of the population highly likely to be infected. Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization. These days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-26\nTitle: No, President Trump, Testing Is Not Causing Case Counts to Rise.\nContent:\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. These assertions are not backed up by the data, a ProPublica analysis shows. While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased. To be sure, the virus exacted a tremendous toll on New York state and on New York City. Though COVID-19 now appears to be under control, more than 389,000 residents of New York state were infected and more than 24,700 died.\nThe Trump administration has doubled down on its claims that coronavirus case counts are up because the U.S. has increased testing. However, a closer look at graphs of testing numbers and positive cases shows that this isn’t the case for many states. by Charles Ornstein and Ash Ngu June 25, 2020, 3:36 p.m. EDT · In remarks to reporters before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, “Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.” (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The U.S. Response to COVID-19\nHowever, a closer look at graphs of testing numbers and positive cases shows that this isn’t the case for many states. by Charles Ornstein and Ash Ngu June 25, 2020, 3:36 p.m. EDT · In remarks to reporters before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, “Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.” (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The U.S. Response to COVID-19 · ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\n\nInformation 1, published on an unspecified date, states that the rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. cannot be explained solely by increased testing. The article notes that the rate of positive tests is rising even faster than the number of tests being conducted, and that hospitalizations and deaths are also increasing. This information was published before the claim, which means it is relevant to the claim.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-11-19, also supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing. The article notes that the 7-day average percent positivity of tests in the U.S. has risen from 4.2% to 10% as of November 19, indicating that the virus is actually spreading more. This information was published after the claim, but it still provides evidence that the claim is true.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-06-25, states that scientists say it's premature to conclude that the current upticks in COVID-19 cases won't lead to increases in mortality later. The article also notes that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing. This information was published before the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-23, states that upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. The article also notes that case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April, although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. This information was published before the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-26, states that the assertions that the rise in COVID-19 cases is due to increased testing are not backed up by the data. The article notes that in recent days, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, but only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus. This information was published after the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nIn summary, the information provided supports the claim that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing. The claim is true. The evidence includes statements from experts, data on the rate of positive tests, and data on hospitalizations and deaths. Additionally, the evidence includes data on the percent positivity of tests in the U.S. and data on the number of cases and tests in New York. Overall, the evidence provides strong support for the claim.", "response": "FALSE."}

Prior to that, only a few isolated cases had been seen on the island. Internationally, vaccines existed for meningitis types A and C, but not for type B.\nCuban health authorities secured a vaccine from a French pharmaceutical company to immunise the population against type C meningitis. However, in the following years, cases of type B began to rise. A team of specialists from different medical science centres was established, led by a woman biochemist, Concepción Campa, to work intensively on finding a vaccine.\nBy 1984, meningitis B had become the most serious health problem in Cuba. After six years of intense work, Campa’s team produced the world’s first successful meningitis B vaccine in 1988. A member of Campa’s team, Dr Gustavo Sierra recalled their joy:\nBetween 1989 and 1990, the three million Cubans most at risk were vaccinated. Subsequently, 250,000 young people were vaccinated with the VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine, a combined vaccine for meningitis types B and C.

There is currently “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” according to the World Health Organization. It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus.\nOne of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check by Reuters discussing a social media claim that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar eliminates the coronavirus. The claim states that the coronavirus remains in the throat for four days before reaching the lungs and that gargling with salt or vinegar can eliminate the virus. Reuters found no official government or medical advisory recommending the use of saline or vinegar to eliminate the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by 15min.lt stating that there is no proof that salt and/or vinegar can kill the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not provided, is a study discussing the effectiveness of various gargle formulations, including salt water, against SARS-CoV-2.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]]. The nucleic acid vaccine is considered as safer alternative than that of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines which are used currently to acquire immunity against dengue, malaria, typhoid and anthrax etc [25,71].

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers were able to come up with vaccines for this new virus much faster because of work that was already happening. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews and evaluates COVID-19 vaccines for quality, safety, and effectiveness. The FDA then issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain vaccines that meet rigorous, science-based standards. The FDA determines that these vaccines are safe and effective for public use.\nDecember 18, 2020 FDA issued the second EUA for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 18 years and older for the prevention of COVID-19. The federal government has been working since the pandemic started to develop, manufacture, and distribute safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\nSeptember 11, 2023 FDA approved and authorized the emergency use of the updated Moderna and -BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines formulated to better protect against currently circulating variants · April 18, 2023 FDA amended the emergency use authorization to simplify the vaccination schedule for bivalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines\nContent:\nWhen monovalent XBB vaccines are not available, any available WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified vaccine, bivalent variant-containing or monovalent index virus vaccines, may be used since they continue to provide benefits against severe disease in high-risk groups.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.
