The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Neurological symptoms are among the larger array of symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) infection, which includes Long COVID. Long COVID affects different people in different ways-- studies have reported up to 200 symptoms associated with Long COVID, and individuals with the condition experience clusters of symptoms.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, discusses the neurological impact of COVID-19 and various conditions linked to the virus.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking. ... The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. It highlights increased rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the pandemic and social isolation. The impact is more severe for people with pre-existing mental health conditions and substance use disorders. Social isolation has also worsened mental health symptoms for homeless individuals.\n\nInformation 2, also without a specific date, focuses on the psychological consequences of social isolation during the pandemic.

Methods: We conducted a literature search and identified 232 articles; we included 90 after screening. We pulled information from each article using standardized questions for “type of study,” “population,” “specific vaccine,” “reasons for hesitancy,” “hesitancy prevalence,” “attempt at change,” “results of intervention,” and “future interventions.” We created recurrent themes from the data and analyzed these themes via descriptive statistics.\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do give guidance on general approaches to these conversations, keeping up with hard data and multiple studies on various vaccinations can be tedious and is not realistic for many doctors.8,9 · The theme of not enough information is highlighted by more research being cited as the most commonly proposed future intervention.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents. It suggests acknowledging their concerns and sharing what was learned from a healthcare professional.\n\nInformation 4: This article, published in 2020, discusses a study that found it difficult to change the minds of vaccine-hesitant parents. The study involved providing parents with online material tailored to their specific concerns, but it did not result in an increase in vaccination rates.\n\nInformation 5: This article discusses the experiences of healthcare professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children.

Although the performance of these products is most commonly defined as a function of their alcohol concentration, they are multifaceted products in which an interplay of several factors is important in determining efficacy.\nPreventative measures for minimizing ocular exposure while using ABHS have been proposed [92]. The high use of ABHS during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been reported to be a possible cause of disulfiram alcohol reactions [93,94]. However, it has been proposed that inadvertent inhalation (especially if ABHS are used in poorly ventilated areas) rather than topical absorption is more likely to result in high enough amounts of alcohol exposure to elicit a disulfiram reaction [95].\nKeywords: hand sanitizers, alcohol, hand hygiene, tetrahedron, antiseptic, COVID-19 · Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have emerged as an important tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1].

The proportion of the population that died was 0.29% in the most affected region, Lombardia, and 0.57% in the most affected province, Bergamo. Combining reported test positive rates from Italy with estimates of infection fatality rates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we estimate the infection rate as 29% (95% confidence interval 15–52%) in Lombardy, and 72% (95% confidence interval 36–100%) in Bergamo.\nThis selection only makes a statistically significant difference for the region of Lazio and age groups below 30 years of age in few other regions, but otherwise does not affect our conclusions with any significance. Figure 1 shows a clear excess in mortality over the counterfactual predictions after the week ending on 22 February, when the first COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Italy.\nThis number is similar to the NYC IFR estimated from combining the age-dependent IFR from Italy data, and consistent with a lower bound of 0.49% IFR estimated independently of Italian data—by combining the NYC COVID-19 PFR of 0.286% as of October 2020, with the maximum TPR of 0.58% which was reached in April 2020. Similarly, as of April 22 2020, with 9900 confirmed deaths, this IFR of 0.62% predicted 19.3% IR.\nCombining reported test positive rates from Italy with estimates of infection fatality rates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we estimate the infection rate as 29% (95% confidence interval 15–52%) in Lombardy, and 72% (95% confidence interval 36–100%) in Bergamo. ...

On April 10, there was a total of 147,577 positive cases and 18,849 deaths (Fig. 1) (2,3). An analysis of the sub-set of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 (4) was performed with a sample of 1,453 deaths. This analysis showed that 96.5% of people who died were suffering from one or more pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension (69.9%), diabetes mellitus (31.8%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (28.0%) (5).\nThe most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contacting the infection) in deceased patients in Italy were: hypertension − 73.0%, old diabetes − 31.3%, ischemic heart disease − 27.8%, atrial fibrillation − 23.7%, chronic renal failure − 22.2%, active cancer in the last 5 years − 17.3%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) − 16.7% (26).

The MP claimed that 96.3% of people who died from COVID-19 in Italy had other pre-existing diseases. The fact-check article clarifies that this number represents the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus, not that they did not die from COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a preprint study estimating COVID-19 mortality in Italy. The study suggests that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy in 2020 until September 9 was 59,000-62,000, compared to the official number of 36,000. The study also discusses infection rates and infection fatality rates (IFR) in different regions of Italy.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-11-09, is a fact-check article by Reuters addressing false claims about Italy reducing its COVID-19 death toll. The article clarifies that the often-cited figure of 2.9% represents the percentage of COVID-19 deaths with no pre-existing diseases, not the percentage of total COVID-19 deaths.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a study discussing factors related to COVID-19 in Northern Italy. The study analyzes a subset of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 and found that 96.5% of them had one or more pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-30, states that 96.3% of people who died after developing COVID-19 in Italy died from other pathologies. However, the provided information contradicts this claim.\n\nInformation 1 clarifies that the number 96.3% refers to the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus, not that they did not die from COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4 further clarifies that the often-cited figure of 2.9% represents the percentage of COVID-19 deaths with no pre-existing diseases, not the percentage of total COVID-19 deaths.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect and misleading. The percentage 96.3% does not represent the percentage of people who died from other pathologies after developing COVID-19. Instead, it represents the percentage of people who died and had other pre-existing diseases when they died from the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

The data tells a different story.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge 'Only' Due to Testing, Misleads ...\nContent:\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February. New coronavirus booster: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone 6 months or older get an updated coronavirus shot, but the vaccine rollout has seen some hiccups, especially for children.\nNo one thinks that anywhere near half the state’s population had covid-19 at that time, so those results would imply that testing was overly focused on a subset of the population highly likely to be infected. Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization. These days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-26\nTitle: No, President Trump, Testing Is Not Causing Case Counts to Rise.\nContent:\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. These assertions are not backed up by the data, a ProPublica analysis shows. While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased. To be sure, the virus exacted a tremendous toll on New York state and on New York City. Though COVID-19 now appears to be under control, more than 389,000 residents of New York state were infected and more than 24,700 died.\nThe Trump administration has doubled down on its claims that coronavirus case counts are up because the U.S. has increased testing. However, a closer look at graphs of testing numbers and positive cases shows that this isn’t the case for many states. by Charles Ornstein and Ash Ngu June 25, 2020, 3:36 p.m. EDT · In remarks to reporters before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, “Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.” (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The U.S. Response to COVID-19\nHowever, a closer look at graphs of testing numbers and positive cases shows that this isn’t the case for many states. by Charles Ornstein and Ash Ngu June 25, 2020, 3:36 p.m. EDT · In remarks to reporters before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, “Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.” (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The U.S. Response to COVID-19 · ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

The results can be used by nurse leaders to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nursing staff members working during COVID-19.\nInterventions can improve the recognition of psychological symptoms among nurses exposed to traumatic events. Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a significant correlation between PTSD and BOS, and that the pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma, increasing PTSD among HCWs.\n\nInformation 3, published on March 2, 2022, discusses a study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration that explores the connection between nurses' practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The study aims to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions for nursing staff members.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of preventing PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients.

The correlation between PTSD and the COVID-19 pandemic among nurses is evident in Information 2 and 5.

The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.)

The reporters seemed stunned. “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” Trump told them. The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.

In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection.

Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost.

Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like.

However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks, steam sterilization (e.g. in laminate sterilization wrappings) of used masks at 121 ⁰C in laminated bags, is a simple, useful, cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks safe for reuse.\nIn preparation for that scarcity we performed a study to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks in order to verify their re-usability with a method that could be applied in practice using already available equipment. Therefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags.\nTherefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags.

As for other types of masks the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified masks is very low. Keywords: PPE, SARS-COV-2, Coronavirus, Filtering facepiece respirators, Decontamination, Reuse\nConsequently, prevention professionals, companies and individuals, from all over the world need to know how to disinfect and sterilize masks that, in principle, were designed, manufactured and certified for short-term use and subsequent disposal, and also to be aware of the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified ones.\nThus, in this publication we conducted a rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides and other information available online with two objectives. On the one hand, to identify in the scientific literature the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks. On the other hand, to identify the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can disposable masks be reused after sterilization?\nContent:\nIf there are not enough N95 or surgical masks, as long as the mask is not obviously contaminated, soiled or damaged, it can also be considered to be reused in a short period of time. After use you can fold the inner layer of the mask in half, hang it separately or place it in a separate packaging bag. Healthy people can use N95 mask for 8 hours continuously or intermittently, and surgical mask for 4 hours at a time. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases are not recommended to wear them for a long time. ... - Discussion on the feasibility of sterilization and reuse of disposable dust mask by Yu Taishan, He Yufang, et al.\nThe disinfection method of spraying alcohol on the mask will destroy the electrostatic absorption of the mask, causing filtering efficiency of the mask lowering below 95%. 3. Other methods such as steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high temperature sterilization methods also made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%.In addition, high temperature and high-pressure method makes the mask seriously deformed.\nOther methods such as steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high temperature sterilization methods also made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%.In addition, high temperature and high-pressure method makes the mask seriously deformed. 4. The new coronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, and ultraviolet disinfection does not affect the filtration efficiency of respirators.\nThe premise of using the mask again after disinfection is that the sterilized mask can neither affect the free circulation of air nor destroy the filtering mechanism of the mask. So, what kind of disinfection can meet these two points? To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23. Panta Gopal & Richardson Ann & Shaw Ian. Effectiveness of autoclaving in sterilizing reusable medical devices in healthcare facilities.\nSeveral studies have shown the effects of different sterilization methods, including gamma sterilization, plasma sterilization, steam and dry heat sterilization, microwaves, washing machines and UV–C light, as methods to decontaminate face masks for reuse [9–13]. These studies suggest that gamma and steam sterilization conducted at 134°C damage the microstructure of the filter material [9].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can Disposable Face Masks Be Reused? | Primo Dental Products\nContent:\nAll that considered, it’s only the right time to ask the question: can disposable face masks be reused? And if so, how can you reuse them properly? In this article, we will talk about which face masks can be reused, the proper way to sterilize and reuse your face mask, and what to do with your disposable face masks after you reuse them for the final time.\nAll these instances aside, it may be possible to reuse your disposable mask safely. This brings us to our next topic: Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them.\nCan disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them. It is not necessary to douse your disposable mask in rubbing alcohol or disinfectant. In fact, treating your face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\nIn healthcare settings, disposable face masks cannot be reused. For general protection against COVID-19, on the other hand, it is possible to sterilize and reuse face masks.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study was conducted to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks for reuse. The masks were sterilized using a 15-minute procedure at 121 ºC with both dry and regular steam processes in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes was sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus. After sterilization, the samples were tested and benchmarked with new mouth masks.\n\nInformation 2: A rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides, and other information available online was conducted to identify the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks and the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization. The most promising methods for disinfection are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat, and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave, or steam are not fully recommended.\n\nInformation 3: A discussion on the feasibility of sterilization and reuse of disposable dust masks was conducted. Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease. It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.

These articles were published between April 2020 and October 2020. They address various myths, such as the virus being made in a lab, eating garlic preventing infection, and the virus being a mutated form of the common cold. The articles also mention the role of social media in spreading misinformation and the importance of seeking information from credible sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is a title of an article published on January 19, 2021, that explores coronavirus myths.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is likely to be TRUE. However, without access to the actual content of the article, it is impossible to confirm if the specific myths addressed in the 2021 article have already been debunked in the earlier articles. Nevertheless, the information in the earlier articles highlights the prevalence of misinformation about the coronavirus and the importance of addressing these myths. Therefore, it is plausible that the 2021 article continues to explore and debunk new myths about the coronavirus.", "response": "TRUE."}

International offers of aid are multiplying.\nBy Claire Klobucista, Author and Sabine Baumgartner, Photo Editor ... No country has experienced as devastating a wave of COVID-19 infections as India is now. It set a new record for single-day infections last week, overtaking the United States, and it accounts for almost half of new cases worldwide. Experts say a combination of factors gave rise to the explosion in cases: new variants of the virus, including one first detected in India, that are thought to be more transmissible; a weak government response; and large public gatherings.\nThe average deaths per day are nearing 2,500, and the number continues to climb, pushing cremation facilities and cemeteries past their limits. Overall, the Indian government has reported around 195,000 deaths from COVID-19, but analysts say the total is likely much greater.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Edge of crisis: When kids suffer from COVID-19 - Down To Earth\nContent:\nWith children reporting severe post-COVID-19 symptoms, India must prioritise its paediatric infrastructure ...

Even after four days of care, the fever persisted and the family from Surat, Gujarat, took the infant to his paediatrician. Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors. It usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from COVID-19, suggest the “Guidelines on Operationalization of COVID Care Services for Children & Adolescents”, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in June 2021.\nWhile the proportion of children getting infected by COVID-19 is still not frightening, it is significant enough to establish that children are not as immune to post-COVID-19 complications as thought. Even the sketchy government numbers suggest a steady increase in the share of children in India’s total active COVID-19 cases, which includes patients still infectious.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How India is dealing with COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nIndia, which has the second-largest population in the world is suffering severely from COVID-19 disease. By May 18th, India investigated ∼1 lakh (0.1million) infected cases from COVID-19, and as of 11th July the cases equalled 8 lakhs. Social distancing and lockdown rules were employed in India, which however had an additional impact on the economy, human living, and environment.\nCOVID-19 outbreak is the sixth PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola (2014 in West Africa), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo) [3]. India which is the second-largest population in the world having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on18th May 2020, and as of 11th of July crossed 8.5 lakhs.\nCOVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time.

It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year. We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread. The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004.\nViral posts on social media claim COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in \"every election year,\" suggesting that the new coronavirus is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump. But most of the dates cited to defend those conclusions about previous outbreaks are misleading or incorrect.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim that every election year has a disease is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations including Reuters, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org.\n* The claim lists various diseases such as SARS, avian flu, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus, and matches them up to election years since 2004.\n* However, most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.\n* Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n* While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n* The claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim that every election year has a disease is false. Most of the diseases listed in the claim were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years. While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons. However, the evidence shows that most of the diseases listed in the claim had little to no impact on U.S. elections and were not directly linked to election years.", "response": "FALSE."}

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic something is, on a scale of 0-14. Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood. The pH of the body is a tightly regulated.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better. But this is because these are, simply put, healthy foods – not because of any changing pH levels in the blood or the body.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2017-06-16\nTitle: NO DISEASE CAN EXIST IN AN ALKALINE ENVIRONMENT — Natural Food ...\nContent:\nThe pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.

As cancer progresses, the body becomes more and more acidic as its pH drops below 7.35. His discoveries were revolutionary for their time, and contributed greatly to what we know about cancer today. The pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2019-05-08, explains the concept of the alkaline diet and its origins. It states that the body's pH level is tightly regulated and cannot be significantly altered through diet. The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, with 0-6 being acidic, 7 neutral, and 8-14 basic. The body strives to maintain a pH of 7.365. Eating an 80/20 ratio of alkaline to acidic foods is recommended for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2019-07-03, further emphasizes the importance of maintaining an alkaline state in the body to prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health. It suggests a breathing technique to alkalize the body.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, undated but published by the same source, reinforce the idea that diet does not affect the pH of the body. The body maintains a constant, slightly alkaline pH in the blood, and diseases like cancer live in slightly alkaline environments.

It promotes alkaline water as a means to maintain health and prevent illness.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-02-26, states that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. However, the information presented suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body. The body tightly regulates its pH, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments. Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide protection against contagion.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. In fact, the information suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments.

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, so mask-wearing and social distancing are important for curbing spread. While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

COVID-19 in humans is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild or severe illness including death.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-22\nTitle: House flies can carry SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 hours after exposure, ...\nContent:\nA team of researchers in the USA – at Kansas State University and Agricultural Research Service – <strong>found</strong> <strong>that</strong> house flies <strong>can</strong> acquire and harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 hours after exposure.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-28\nTitle: No, coronavirus doesn’t spread through house flies - Health ...\nContent:\nA misleading video centred on the claim that flies <strong>can</strong> <strong>spread</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> if they come into contact with infected human faeces is gaining popularity. Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies. However, the abstract does not provide any details about the study or its findings.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2021, reports on a study conducted by researchers at Kansas State University and the Agricultural Research Service. The study found that house flies can acquire and harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 hours after exposure.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2020, is a fact-check debunking a misleading video claiming that flies can spread the coronavirus if they come into contact with infected human faeces. The fact-check confirms that this claim is false.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that experts in China found that the coronavirus can be spread through houseflies. However, the information available does not support this claim. Information 1, 3, and 5 contradict the claim, stating that while houseflies can carry the virus, there is no evidence to suggest they can transmit it. Information 2 is a fact-check that debunks the claim, and Information 4, published after the claim, reports on a study showing that houseflies can carry the virus for up to 24 hours but does not provide evidence of transmission.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, as there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that houseflies can spread the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false. The information indicates that dryers are not effective at killing all germs and viruses, and there is no mention of using a hairdryer for sterilization purposes. Additionally, the information about hairdryer usage is related to styling hair, not sterilization. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

Since the pandemic started early last year, students have gone through several periods of home-based learning (HBL), and have to abide by strict safe distancing measures in schools, such as sitting individually and apart in classrooms.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-05-22\nTitle: Lessons learned from COVID-19: how did the pandemic affect ...\nContent:\nCountries can continue to encourage healthy choices through laws that make fruits and vegetables more affordable, and by imposing taxes on sugary drinks and creating health promotion campaigns.  · “Not only is home-cooked food often healthier, it can also be less expensive, which is important for families in the current environment, when many people need to find ways to cut costs in their household expenses,” added Dr Wickramasinghe. Unfortunately, the pandemic also presented new challenges for children.\nThirty per cent of children became less physically active during this period, missing out on the health benefits of activities such as cycling, playing football or running around in the park.  · In addition, during the lockdown period over 35% of children spent more time watching television, playing video games or using social media, increasing their sedentary time, thus putting themselves at greater risk of becoming overweight and obese, and increasing their exposure to marketing of unhealthy products via digital media.\nThese data provide invaluable insights into the consequences – both good and bad – of the pandemic and the effects it had on children. This is one of the largest studies of its kind, and the lessons learned can help countries to plan for future emergencies and pandemics. “The lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of implementing effective policies to improve food environments, encourage physical activity, and protect the health and well-being of families.\nLockdowns, restrictions, and emergency policies have changed our diets, physical activity patterns and many other daily habits that are tightly connected to our well-being.

Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.

These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.\nThe time elapsed since the last COVID-19 vaccination may need to be considered when invasive procedures are required.

Crowded regions with actively moving people (called at-risk regions) are susceptible to spreading the disease, especially if they contain asymptomatic infected people together with healthy people.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 4, and 5 all discuss a study conducted by researchers at Colorado State University, led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Edwin Chong. The researchers developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy is detailed in a paper published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020 (Alsaeedy & Chong, 2020). The technique they developed helps identify the most crowded areas, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people. This method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps as it protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users.\n\nInformation 3 provides additional context about the underlying technologies and privacy concerns related to using mobile networks for tracking movements of people and relating them to the spread of COVID-19. It mentions a paper by Alsaeedy and Chong (2020) that explores performance indicators in a network to determine how crowded certain cells in a mobile network are and monitor their mobility with neighboring cells, to assess the risk of COVID-19 spread.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim is TRUE. The researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission.

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China. The article states that there is no explanation for this claim and suggests that it is not accurate to compare Macedonia to China in this way.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-02-26, reports that North Macedonia has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-22, is an article debunking the claim that North Macedonia has not received medical help from the European Union.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-04, reports that North Macedonia has experienced a new spike in coronavirus cases, with 101 new cases reported on Wednesday.\n\nInformation 5 is a social briefing about the gambling industry in North Macedonia, with no specific publication date. It discusses the rise of the gambling industry in the country and the impact it has had on the local population.\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China is likely false. Information 1, which was published on the same day as the claim, states that there is no evidence to support this claim and suggests that it is not accurate to compare Macedonia to China in this way.

Physicians are expected to receive base pay at their 2019 level during this period. However, the situation after May 15 is uncertain. Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, mentioned that it's hard to predict the future of the COVID-19 crisis. Financial advisor Wrenne suggests that physicians should plan for a 6-month financial recovery, until October, before income returns to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Recently, a team of investigators affiliated with the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial — called Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment, Investigating Outpatients Nationwide, or ACTION for short — will involve human participants, and the researchers started recruiting on May 26, 2020.\nProctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future. Lastly, standard guidelines for the administration of the antibiotics must be established.\nBeović B, Dousak M, Ferreira-Coimbra J, et al.

Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have been analyzed for their potential capacity to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro, blocking replication [19]. Furthermore, beta-lactam antibiotics are being evaluated in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but more clinical trials are necessary in order to properly evaluate results [20].

And with COVID, there's a very large expansion in the number of patients with respiratory disease where patients might feel the urge to take an antibiotic, while in reality COVID is not a bacteria, it's a virus.\nVGS Thank you, Hanan. There you have it, Dr. Hanan Balkhy explaining antibiotics and COVID-19. If you find this information useful, please share it with your networks and be the source of trusted evidence-based information.\nVGS Antibiotics and COVID-19. What do you need to know about these two topics? Welcome to Science in 5, I'm Vismita Gupta-Smith and we are talking to Dr. Hanan Balkhy today. Welcome, Hanan. HB Thank you, Vismita. Nice to be with you today · VGS Hanan, explain antibiotics and why they are important.\nAnd, to only be receiving antibiotics if they are significantly ill, where the healthcare provider is suspicious of – on top of the COVID-19 – the patient having a bacterial infection. And, this needs to be done by a prescription of a healthcare provider. VGS Thank you, Hanan. There you have it, Dr. Hanan Balkhy explaining antibiotics and COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Antibiotics in treatment of COVID-19 complications: a review of ...\nContent:\nThe present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

Information 4, published on 2020-04-04, quotes U.P. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi saying that Tablighi Jamaat members are enemies of humanity, indicating a negative attitude towards the group. Information 5, published on 2023-11-28, provides a summary of the Tablighi Jamaat COVID-19 hotspot in Delhi, stating that Uttar Pradesh managed to track and quarantine 1,205 people who participated in the congregation by 5 April, and that 4,291 confirmed cases of COVID-19 linked to this event by the Union Health Ministry represented a third of all the confirmed cases of India by 18 April. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Uttar Pradesh Police would take action against Tablighi Jamaat members who misbehave with healthcare workers in quarantine facilities. However, the claim does not provide evidence for the beating of the Tablighi Jamaat member, and it is possible that the image shows a different incident. Further evidence is needed to confirm the details of the claim.", "response": "FALSE."}

As such, we have labelled the original claim as misleading because it omits crucial details that may lead to readers forming an incorrect conclusion. ... There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus.\nThe tweet in question does not provide any details about underlying health conditions, it instead uses the word ‘from’ to infer that Covid-19 was the cause of death in the cases. Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Boylan said that this is due to the word constraints in his tweet. “Twitter is limited with characters, so you have to use word economy when you’re doing it. It absolutely wasn’t done to be sensational,” he said. While it may be the case that there is a character limit on Twitter, the tweet makes a critical judgement that only those without an underlying medical condition die ‘from’ Covid-19.\nThere have been more than 1,700 deaths from Covid-19. Eight of those who have died were under the age of 65 and did not have an underlying condition. Of course, each of the 1,700 deaths is a tragedy.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

Yet, direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, according to one scientist.\n“We’re talking about young individuals who were in a congregate setting at a time when vaccination overall was not that prevalent,” he says. “We didn’t fully know about disease spread as much. We knew about hygiene but didn’t understand that with a highly transmissible virus, basic sanitation measures such as hand washing weren’t going to cover you.” · Had certain conditions that occurred during the 1918 flu pandemic been replicated a century later, Srivastava suggests, we might have seen a greater impact of COVID-19 on young adults.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-03, states that the 1918 flu pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, killed more than 50 million people worldwide.
