The present study was a qualitative phenomenological inquiry into the lived experiences of thirteen men migrant workers who had to move back home overnight due to the shutting down of most workplaces in Mumbai, Maharashtra after the announcement of the lockdown.\nIt is within this framework that this paper attempts to bring to the forefront the voices of migrant workers in India, a group that experienced an acute humanitarian crisis after the lockdown was announced in India on 23 March 2020. Due to unequal growth and urbanisation across the different states, inter-state migrants move from less-developed areas to more-developed areas such as metropolitan cities in the hope of earning a better livelihood (Kundu & Sarangi, 2007).

Only reverse international migrants from Gulf countries were contacted as a majority of Indian workers are employed in this region. All the workers covered under this study belong to the low-skilled and semi-skilled workers category.\nUttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan are among the major origin states, while Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are among the important destination states for these migrant workers (Kamal, 2018).

Yes. This is another reason to stay vigilant against becoming infected and transmitting the virus. As with other coronaviruses that only cause colds, you have a period that you're immune, but that goes away over time. That also appears to be the case with this coronavirus. Immunity is estimated to last up to three months. Having COVID-19 usually results in antibodies which should help protect you from re-infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-18\nTitle: Antibodies in recovering COVID-19 patients fade quickly: Study\nContent:\nNew Delhi : The researchers have found that the antibodies in the recovering COVID-19 patients slashed rapidly during the time the symptoms suppressed. Since no official vaccine is available in the market, the hospitals are relying on the plasma therapy on patients who are in severe condition. The blood of recovered patients contains antibodies that act against the coronavirus.\nIn the new longitudinal study, Finzi and his colleagues analyzed blood samples collected at one-month intervals from 31 individuals recovering from COVID-19. They measured levels of immunoglobulins that act against the coronavirus S protein and tested the ability of the antibodies to neutralize the virus. The researchers observed variation on the level of individual patients but identified a consistent overall signal: The levels of Immunoglobulins G, A, and M that target the binding site decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after symptoms began.\nThe blood of recovered patients contains antibodies that act against the coronavirus. Meanwhile, there is a whole lot of debates over the effectiveness of plasma therapy; but it has been acknowledged that it reduces recovery time and hospitalization. In a recent study, published in journal mBio, if convalescent plasma is ultimately shown to have a clear benefit, the authors concluded, then it needs to be collected during a specific window of time after recovery.\nThe study also mentioned that the plasma cannot be taken from the blood of recovering patients. It also claimed that the person must have remained with no symptoms for atleast 14days after recovering from coronavirus. “We don’t want to transfuse the virus, just transfuse the antibodies,” said Andres Finzi, Ph.D., at the University of Montreal, in Canada.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-20, is from the American Society for Microbiology's open-access journal mBio and provides detailed results of a study on antibody levels in COVID-19 patients. The study found that antibody levels, specifically IgG, IgA, and IgM targeting the coronavirus S protein, decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after symptoms began. This suggests that the antibodies in recovered COVID-19 patients fade quickly.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study showing that antibody levels in both symptomatic and asymptomatic recovered COVID-19 patients declined sharply in just two to three months after infection.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2024-01-09, is a reference to the ScienceDaily article (Information 1) published on 2020-10-20.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2013-08-06, states that immunity to COVID-19 is estimated to last up to three months.

Sputnik V was developed at the Gamaleya Institute, in Moscow. Before the pandemic, the institute did not have a particularly high profile. Gamaleya scientists had produced vaccines for Ebola and MERS (the respiratory illness, similar to COVID-19, that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012), but neither had been widely employed or authorized for use outside Russia.\nThis is not always the case: several prototype vaccines, including one for H.I.V., have produced antibodies without protecting against infection.

The Gamaleya scientists’ familiarity with adenovirus vectors allowed them to move quickly. Logunov, who worked with some sixty researchers at Gamaleya on the COVID-19 vaccine, told me, “We didn’t face the question of which approach to use.” Discussing the strengths of the adenovirus platform, he said, “I would compare it to a rocket.\n“It’s a way to confuse the immune system so that it focusses on the COVID-19 protein,” he said. But, he added, “we need to see the data before we can say whether this particular vaccine is ready for prime time.” Chumakov expressed similar reservations, saying that, until the long-term efficacy of the various vectors has been proved, the arguments for and against each approach remain “entirely theoretical, and thus equally valid or bogus.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inside Russia’s Race to Develop a Covid-19 Vaccine Before the ...\nContent:\nA scientist at Moscow's Gamaleya Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology working on a Covid-19 vaccine on Aug. 6. rdif handout/Shutterstock ...

Ideally, multiple vaccines will be approved in most countries and we will have a detailed understanding of their efficacy, the duration of the immunity they induce, and their effect on viral transmission.\nAs cases and deaths continue to rise across the world, the non-pharmaceutical interventions to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that the global population has by now become accustomed to will need to remain in place for a while longer. ...

One of the enduring images from the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic was planes full of doctors arriving in New York City — then, the epicenter of the pandemic — to tears and rapturous applause. They came from around the country and around the world to support the city in a moment of need.\nPreventive measures are important, but it’s equally important to respond to a positive COVID-19 test. “You need to keep on the lookout,” Dr. Dweik urges. “If you don’t feel well, make sure you tell your doctor early because there are treatments now that weren’t there at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Those treatments can reduce the risk of hospitalization and the duration of the disease.”\nThose treatments can reduce the risk of hospitalization and the duration of the disease.” · On May 11, 2023, the Biden Administration announced the end of both the national and public health emergency declarations. While case numbers and death rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are declining, the pandemic isn’t over. Ending the emergency declarations simply means that the governmental response to the pandemic is scaling down. You can expect to see costs associated with vaccination, testing and treatment go up.\nFrom the beginning, the COVID-19 pandemic has looked dramatically different based on where you’re living and the information being made publicly available. Recently, China faced a major surge in COVID-19 cases — a side effect of lifting public health restrictions and poor-quality vaccines.\n\nInformation 1, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), provides information about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety, and side effects. It does not explicitly state that the pandemic is not over, but it does mention that vaccination efforts are ongoing and that non-pharmaceutical interventions will still be needed.\n\nInformation 2, published by The Lancet, discusses the progress of COVID-19 vaccines and the challenges of implementing mass immunization programs. It emphasizes that the pandemic will not end overnight and that it will likely take a few years before the virus can be controlled worldwide. This information suggests that the pandemic is not over.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2023, provides facts about COVID-19 vaccines, their benefits, and possible side effects.

This information suggests that the pandemic is not over, but the global response is transitioning to a new phase.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2023, asserts that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, despite the end of emergency declarations by the U.S. government. It highlights the importance of preventive measures, responding to positive tests, and the continued availability of treatments.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and a vaccine is no longer needed is false.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents.

The study involved providing parents with online material tailored to their specific concerns, but it did not result in an increase in vaccination rates.\n\nInformation 5: This article discusses the experiences of healthcare professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children.

While the definition of SARS, an earlier coronavirus panic, was self-limiting, the definition of COVID-19 disease is open ended, allowing the imaginary epidemic to grow.\nPutting aside the existence of the virus, if the COVID-19 test has a problem with false positives (as all biological tests do) then testing an uninfected population will produce only false-positive tests, and the definition of the disease will allow the epidemic to go on forever.\nAnd, given enough time there will be a vaccine developed and, for some of the traumatized countries, it may become mandatory, even if developed after the epidemic has disappeared, so that proving that it reduces the risk of developing a positive test will be impossible.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: David Crowe - Academia.edu\nContent:\nAcademia.edu is a place to share and follow research.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-26\nTitle: David Crowe | Coronavirus COVID-19: The Risks, The Testing, & The ...\nContent:\n<strong>David</strong> <strong>Crowe</strong> <strong>|</strong> <strong>Coronavirus</strong> COVID-19: The Risks, The <strong>Testing</strong>, &amp; The Treatments — Part 1.

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19. In this study, we tested four commercially available mouthwash/gargle formulations and salt water against SARS-CoV-2.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Gargling Salt Water Could Lower COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk\nContent:\nRinsing your throat or nose with a salt water (saline) solution may help protect against severe COVID-19 infection, based on a new study presented this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Anaheim, California.

COVID-19: Researchers Launch Study to Lessen ...\nContent:\nSalt water gargle is a time-tested way to alleviate sore-throat pain. As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.

However, recent studies suggest that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid by reducing hospitalization rates in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

At the state level, similar two key factors contribute to our ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble model.

This bi-disease ARGOX-Local is an intermediate method that connects Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 information in geographical proximity, and is a joint COVID-ILI method that uses each other’s growth trend to help the other, which can efficiently detect upcoming surges and peaking periods.\nThese methods are adapted directly from the established Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 predictions with minimal changes, which reduces the chance of over-fitting. The previously proposed winner-takes-all ensemble framework44 also naturally incorporates bi-disease ARGOX-Local as one additional constituent model, and is able to robustly select the “best” estimate among the sub-models during rapid changing dynamics.\nFortunately, by recognizing the correlation between Influenza-like Illness activities and COVID-19 growth trend at both national and state levels, %ILI and COVID-19 cases/deaths are able to rely more on each other when Google search queries’ signal degenerates, which enable robust estimations and fast recoveries from overshooting.\n\nThe claim was published in 2020-06-26, stating that COVID-19 spread can be estimated by looking at past trends of influenza-like illnesses.

It also mentions that COVID-19 spreads more easily than flu.\n\nInformation 5, without a publication date, discusses joint COVID-19 and influenza-like illness forecasts in the United States, including the use of ARGO-Nat and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble models that combine Google search data, Influenza-like Illness activity data, and COVID-19 cases/deaths to produce estimates.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim (Information 3) was published in 2020-06-26, while more comprehensive information about COVID-19 and influenza-like illnesses was published later (Information 1, 2, 4, and 5). However, Information 5 does mention the use of Influenza-like Illness activity data in COVID-19 forecasts, which supports the idea of using past trends of influenza-like illnesses to estimate COVID-19 spread.\n\nConsidering the information available, the claim (Information 3) is partially supported, as it is plausible to use past trends of influenza-like illnesses to estimate COVID-19 spread.

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ... First, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The Climate Crisis – A Race We Can Win | United Nations\nContent:\nAccording to a September 2019 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report, we are at least one degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and close to what scientists warn would be “an unacceptable risk”. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement. Climate is a risk multiplier that makes worse already existing challenges.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Our planet is warming.

Combatting the coronavirus pandemic required each one of us to do our part, change our habits and daily routines and make personal sacrifices. If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change. Though invisible, COVID-19 has been seen by most people as a “clear and present danger” to the entire world population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-18, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the coronavirus. It explains that there is no evidence to support this claim, and global warming does not occur quickly enough to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, discusses the importance of addressing climate change despite the ongoing pandemic. It highlights that a majority of people are more worried about climate change now than before the pandemic, and policymakers should enact bold reforms to mitigate its effects. It also emphasizes the need for a strategy to overcome short-termism and ensure a just transition.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, outlines the urgency of addressing climate change. It mentions that global temperatures are already 1° Celsius above preindustrial levels and could rise to above 3° Celsius by 2100 if emissions are not slowed down. It also highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on the world's poorest countries and the need for scalable new technologies and nature-based solutions.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5° F and highlights that we have the technology to do so.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-05, draws parallels between the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. It highlights the need for personal sacrifices and a change in habits to combat the climate crisis.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that we must back away from climate change efforts to protect ourselves from the coronavirus is false. There is no evidence to support the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the virus. In fact, addressing climate change is more important than ever, as highlighted in information 2, 3, and 5. The pandemic has shown that political will and personal sacrifices can lead to significant progress in addressing global threats. The fight against the climate crisis requires similar determination and a shift in habits and daily routines.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Science Feedback (2020-03-18).

Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser.\nIrradiation of neurons leads to an elevated temperature local to the targeted cells, which transiently changes the membrane excitability. Opposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5]. Extended exposure to high-intensity infrared light can dramatically increase local temperature and cause tissue damage [10]. Limited exposure leads to less heat generation and generally reversible effects on neuronal activities.\nOpposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5].

Because our immune response to fighting disease, infections and viruses in the body is so complex, there's a lot we don't know about why some people have a more balanced immune response while others don't. \"The immune system is really complicated,\" Dr.\nBecause our immune response to fighting disease, infections and viruses in the body is so complex, there's a lot we don't know about why some people have a more balanced immune response while others don't. \"The immune system is really complicated,\" Dr. Cassel says. \"We don't understand very much of it at all.\"\n\nInformation 1, published in 2022, explains that the immune system is a complex network that defends the body against diseases, and although it's not possible to boost it in the sense of making it stronger, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can support its optimal functioning. Information 2, also published in 2022, reinforces this idea by suggesting six ways to build and maintain a strong immune system, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep. Information 3, published in 2020, provides nine tips to strengthen the immune system naturally, such as consuming healthy fats, practicing moderate exercise, and managing stress levels. Information 4, published in 2022, lists 15 foods that can help boost the immune system, while acknowledging that the immune system is complex and eating a healthful, balanced diet is just one way to support it. Finally, Information 5, published in 2020, features an interview with an immunologist who explains that the concept of boosting the immune system is inaccurate and that maintaining a balanced immune response is more desirable.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that it is possible to boost the immune system is not entirely accurate. While maintaining a healthy lifestyle, consuming a balanced diet, practicing moderate exercise, and managing stress levels can support the immune system's optimal functioning, these measures do not necessarily \"boost\" or strengthen it in the way that the claim suggests. Therefore, the claim is partially false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ...

It did not go smoothly. - POLITICO\nContent:\nIt was April 2009 and the 3-month-old Obama administration was desperately grappling with the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression when homeland security adviser John Brennan arrived at the Oval Office to warn the president and Vice President Joe Biden of a new crisis: H1N1, the swine flu virus, was showing signs of rapid spread in Mexico, while cases were popping up in California and Texas. Brennan pointed out that the Spanish flu — the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history — was an H1N1 strain. “It made their eyebrows go up,” Brennan says now, recalling Biden’s reaction in particular.\nAs he faces daily criticism of his response to the coronavirus — the most severe pandemic in a century — Trump has tried to turn the spotlight on the Obama-Biden administration’s handling of the swine flu. In tweets, cable news interviews and news briefings, Trump has suggested Obama and Biden completely bungled the response. On March 12, when there were only about 40 recorded coronavirus deaths in the United States, Trump tweeted: “Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people.\nObama, seeking to learn from his predecessors’ experiences, invited members of the Ford administration to visit the White House and discuss their own fateful dance with the swine flu in 1976, when a variant of H1N1 broke out on a U.S. military base and President Gerald Ford ordered a nationwide vaccination program.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2009-04-30\nTitle: Vice President Joe Biden's Remarks on Swine Flu Draw Criticism ...\nContent:\nBiden's comments came just hours before the White House announced that a Department of Energy official who had traveled to Mexico City with Secretary Energy Chu exhibited flu-like symptoms upon his return, but tested negative for the swine flu.

At a news conference Wednesday evening, President Obama said Americans who may be sick should avoid airplanes and \"any system of public transportation where you're confined,\" but the vice president today took it one step further.\nIf you're out in the middle of the field and someone sneezes, that's one thing. If you're in a closed aircraft, a closed container, a closed car, a closed classroom, that's another thing.\" Biden's comments came just hours before the White House announced that a Department of Energy official who had traveled to Mexico City with Secretary Energy Chu exhibited flu-like symptoms upon his return, but tested negative for the swine flu.\nWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the individual did not come within six feet of Obama but was present at a dinner with him and did come into contact with Chu. Gibbs added that about 10 staffers who were on the Mexico City trip with Obama consulted doctors for flu-like symptoms, but none of them tested positive for the swine flu.

It mentions that the Trump administration has criticized the Obama-Biden administration's handling of the swine flu, suggesting that it was mishandled.\n\nInformation 2, published by ABC News, discusses Vice President Biden's comments on avoiding confined spaces due to concerns about the swine flu.

Furthermore, then-Vice President Biden did not always reverse his stance on the issue, as suggested by the claim.

They also had gathered data from primates and mice. In February, they began diving into these data. “We started to look at cells from tissues such as the lining of the nasal cavity, the lungs, and gut, based on reported symptoms and where the virus has been detected,” says Ordovas-Montanes.\nInterferon actually turned on the ACE2 gene at higher levels, potentially giving the virus new portals to get in. Is interferon alpha — normally a defense — helping SARS-CoV-2 infect cells? (Nevit Dilmen/Wikimedia Commons) “ACE2 is also critical in protecting people during various types of lung injury,” notes Ordovas-Montanes. “When ACE2 comes up, that’s usually a productive response.

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease. It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins. The study also predicts how a key entry protein is regulated with other immune system genes and reveals potential targets for the development of treatments to reduce transmission.

The 26-page paper, led by Chinese virologist Li-Meng Yan, a postdoctoral researcher who left Hong Kong University, has not undergone peer review and asserts that this evidence of genetic engineering has been “censored” in the scientific journals.\nFinding answers to the precise events that led to a spillover pandemic is a “needle in a haystack proposition,” says Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist from Columbia University, who co-authored an early research paper in Nature Medicine about the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. The Yan report claims this Nature Medicine report had a “conflict of interest” due to Lipkin’s work in containing the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, for which he received an award from the Chinese government.\nThe Yan report claims this Nature Medicine report had a “conflict of interest” due to Lipkin’s work in containing the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, for which he received an award from the Chinese government. Lipkin says this accusation is “absurd,” and when asked for his view on the role of bioengineering in the origins of SARS-CoV-2, he adds: “There is no data to support this.”\nAs such, they would be a poor starting point for bioengineering SARS-CoV-2. Engineering a virus in which you had to replace more than 10 percent of its genome is inefficient, if not impossible, according to Rasmussen and several other virologists. The fact that these strains were identified at a Chinese military lab is also “just circumstantial,” says Robertson.

Proponents of the lab leak hypothesis reacted by accusing the agencies of conspiring with the Chinese, or of being incompetent.\nThere is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic, or that any suspicious biosecurity incidents happened in any laboratory. Many scenarios proposed for a lab leak are characteristic of conspiracy theories. Central to many is the misplaced suspicion about the proximity of the outbreak to a virology institute that studies coronaviruses, the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Most large Chinese cities have laboratories that study coronaviruses, and virus outbreaks typically begin in rural areas, but are first noticed in large cities.\nProponents of the lab leak theory typically omit to mention that most large Chinese cities have coronavirus research laboratories.

In June, he published a study containing documentary evidence that, in the two years prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, nearly fifty thousand live animals representing thirty-eight wild species—many of which are now known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2—were sold and butchered in Wuhan markets, including Huanan.\n\nInformation 1, published on an unknown date, discusses a report by Chinese virologist Li-Meng Yan claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a lab.

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020). Human activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).\nHuman activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports. Despite the decrease in EVALI with the arrival of COVID-19, EVALI should still be considered a differential diagnosis for people with COVID-19 for reasons outlined in this review.\nAlthough easily forgotten in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a major outbreak of vaping-related illness dominated public health concerns before the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. This narrative review describes vaping devices, summarizes the adverse health effects of vaping on the lungs and other systems, considers the potential interplay between vaping and COVID-19, and highlights gaps in knowledge about vaping that warrant further research.\nHospitalizations for EVALI reached a peak in late 2019 and rapidly declined to extremely low numbers of reported cases by January 2020, just before the initial identification of COVID-19 cases in the United States.47 Although vaping-related illness may have nearly disappeared as a consequence of increased public awareness resulting in risk reduction by users and by removal of vitamin E acetate from vaping products, a case report of a patient in April 2020 reminds clinicians that EVALI should remain in the differential diagnosis for young patients admitted with severe lung injury.48 Presenting symptoms of EVALI (dyspnea, cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) overlap with those of COVID-19,36,49,50 and during population surges of the pandemic there is a tendency to narrow diagnostic considerations.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is about a false claim on Facebook where pictures of a crying child and two adults in hospital beds were shared with the claim that the family members are infected with COVID-19.

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false.

Additionally, the information about hairdryer usage is related to styling hair, not sterilization. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

A plane carrying 117,000 Pfizer/BioNTech doses landed at Bogota’s El Dorado Airport Monday, arriving as many in the region grow impatient over the slow pace of the COVAX vaccine rollout. “Today marks a very important milestone,” Colombian President Iván Duque said.\nColombia reached an agreement in October to purchase 20 million doses through the COVAX initiative, enough to vaccinate 10 million people, or about one-fifth of the country’s population. But like many in Latin America, the Andean nation has scrambled to obtain more doses as the COVAX rollout drags on.\nWith more than 50 million confirmed cases and 1.2 million deaths, countries in the Americas are among the hardest hit by COVID-19, and the WHO estimates the region will have to vaccinate nearly 700 million people in order to contain the pandemic — a feat that at the current rate would be many months away.

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs.\nBoth SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body.\nFull-length genome sequencing revealed that 2019-nCoV shares 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, and pairwise protein sequence analysis found that it belonged to the class of SARS-related coronaviruses [3]. Both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV enter host cell via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3]. Therefore, this virus was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2.\nA spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope of the coronavirus can bind to specific receptors on the membrane of host cells. Previous studies have shown that ACE2 is a specific functional receptor for SARS-CoV [11]. Zhou et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 can enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2 or cells expressing other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), confirming that ACE2 is the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Further studies showed that the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to ACE2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV to ACE2 [12]. The probable mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells based on SARS-CoV studies is displayed in Fig.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-05\nTitle: Fact Check: No, 'collective consciousness' on ACE-2 receptors won't ...\nContent:\nHyderabad: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, prime minister Narendra Modi had once again called for citizens of India to unite and &#x27;come together against fighting the virus&#x27;.

ACE2 is a homolog of the ACE that acts on several substrates in the renin-Ang (angiotensin) system.\nThe SARS-CoV S protein ectodomain is a trimeric S2 stalk terminating with 3 individual S1 heads, which contain the S1 C-terminal domain with affinity to ACE2-binding domains.2 From the RBD/ACE2 interaction, these authors established important principles on host receptor adaptations, cross-species infections, and future evolution of SARS-CoV.2 The structure of the RBD moreover suggested ways to design coronaviruses vaccines.34 Unfortunately, this opportunity was not fully explored as the SARS-CoV infection resolved spontaneously.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: What is the ACE2 receptor, how is it connected to coronavirus and ...\nContent:\nIn the search for treatments for COVID-19, many researchers are focusing their attention on a specific protein that allows the virus to infect human cells. Called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 “receptor,” the protein provides the entry point for the coronavirus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells.

The ACE2 receptor is a protein that allows the virus to infect human cells, and there is no evidence suggesting that \"collective consciousness\" on ACE-2 receptors has any effect on the virus. The information provided in the articles published on April 5, 2020, supports this conclusion, as they debunk the claim and mention that scientists have appealed to the public to not believe such statements.

What’s more, many people who are at heightened risk for a severe illness from COVID-19 are also more likely to experience anxiety, such as people who have an existing chronic illness.\nThere are a few key differences that happen during COVID-19 but not during anxiety, Erickson says.  · It’s important to pay attention to these because this is how you’ll know if what you’re experiencing is anxiety or something more medically serious. First, Erickson recommends checking your temperature. Try not to do this regularly — once a day will work. It’s pretty simple: If you don’t have a fever (usually defined as 100.4 degrees F or higher), your symptoms are probably caused by anxiety, not the coronavirus.\nIt’s pretty simple: If you don’t have a fever (usually defined as 100.4 degrees F or higher), your symptoms are probably caused by anxiety, not the coronavirus. It’s also important to really tune into what’s going on in your mind and body. If your thoughts are racing or you feel an impending sense of doom, those are also signs that anxiety is the culprit.  · “Right now COVID-19 is not associated with racing thoughts, it’s not associated with muscle tension or other panic attack symptoms.\nIf your thoughts are racing or you feel an impending sense of doom, those are also signs that anxiety is the culprit.  · “Right now COVID-19 is not associated with racing thoughts, it’s not associated with muscle tension or other panic attack symptoms. Be really concrete with yourself about what symptoms you’re experiencing,” Erickson says.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-25\nTitle: How Can You Tell the Difference Between Anxiety and COVID-19 Symptoms?\nContent:\nWhen we’re all on the look-out for potential COVID-19 symptoms — shortness of breath, cough and fever — those physical anxiety symptoms can ratchet your fear up even higher. The best course of action if you’re concerned about your symptoms is to talk with your doctor. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about how anxiety affects your body and the overlap of symptoms with COVID-19.\nPreliminary research suggests that COVID-19 can cause digestive symptoms including a loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. If you’re having a hard time determining if the tightness in your chest and shallow breathing are related to your increased anxiety or a potential sign of COVID-19, you’re not alone. Because we’re still learning about the coronavirus, we can’t know exactly what symptoms it causes for most people.\nAs things develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s one thing just about everybody has in common: A drastic increase in anxiety. Whether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically.\nWhether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically. You might find yourself breathing shallowly or ever experience flu-like aches. When we’re all on the look-out for potential COVID-19 symptoms — shortness of breath, cough and fever — those physical anxiety symptoms can ratchet your fear up even higher.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-12, describes the physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks and those of COVID-19. It explains that anxiety can cause chest pain and other physical symptoms, which might make a person worry that they have COVID-19. Information 2, published on 2020-11-09, also discusses the similarities between anxiety symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms, and provides advice on how to differentiate between the two. Information 3 is a study abstract that examines the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among those who receive a positive COVID-19 test. Information 4, from UW Medicine, explains the differences between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms, and recommends checking for fever and paying attention to racing thoughts and muscle tension. Information 5, published on 2020-03-25, discusses how anxiety can affect the body and cause symptoms that overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"What is the difference between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms?\" is true, as there are several resources available that provide information on how to differentiate between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms. These resources explain that while anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, COVID-19 is not currently associated with racing thoughts or muscle tension. Additionally, taking one's temperature and paying attention to one's thoughts and body can help determine whether symptoms are caused by anxiety or COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) continues to hit-hard on many countries across the world. Uganda reported its first case of COVID-19 on the March 21, 2020 (Coronavirus Disease, 2020).\nIn addition to the truck drivers, two cases of local transmission have been reported among Uganda Police Force officers, which may indicate an on-going community transmission of COVID-19. ... Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The confirmed case was a 36-year-old male who had travelled to Dubai on 17 March 2020 for a business trip. On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.
