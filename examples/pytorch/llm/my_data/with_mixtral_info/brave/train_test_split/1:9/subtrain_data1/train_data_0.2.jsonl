The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

The results can be used by nurse leaders to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nursing staff members working during COVID-19.\nInterventions can improve the recognition of psychological symptoms among nurses exposed to traumatic events. Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a significant correlation between PTSD and BOS, and that the pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma, increasing PTSD among HCWs.\n\nInformation 3, published on March 2, 2022, discusses a study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration that explores the connection between nurses' practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The study aims to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions for nursing staff members.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of preventing PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. It also outlines the symptoms of PTSD according to ICD-10 and DSM-5.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, focuses on factors associated with PTSD in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in South Korea.

The correlation between PTSD and the COVID-19 pandemic among nurses is evident in Information 2 and 5.

The Canadian government has also developed a framework to guide policy makers and public health professionals in making decisions related to COVID-19.\n\nThe government strongly recommends wearing masks on planes and trains, and those experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should not travel to Canada. If symptoms arise during travel, individuals should inform authorities and may be assessed by a Quarantine Officer. Provincial or territorial requirements should be checked for guidance on what to do if symptomatic or tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe risk of getting COVID-19 varies, and some people are at higher risk of severe illness or outcomes. Vaccines help reduce the risks of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. There are also treatments available for COVID-19.\n\nClaim Veracity:\nThe claim that Canada is free of COVID-19 is false. The information provided clearly states that vaccines help reduce the risks of severe illness, hospitalization, and death, and there are treatments available. This implies that Canada still has active cases of COVID-19. Additionally, the government's continued monitoring of the situation, travel recommendations, and border measure backgrounder all indicate the presence of COVID-19 within Canada.", "response": "FALSE."}

They're common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats. Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.\nThe older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness. You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions: ... A weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroids ... Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus.\nSome children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels. If you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19.\nIf you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19. That said, having schizophrenia is the biggest risk factor for besides age for COVID mortality. Those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are prone to metabolic syndrome, which includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and is associated with systemic inflammation. All of which is exacerbated by COVID. Mood and anxiety disorders were not connected to the higher risk, but people living with mental health conditions may have certain symptoms that can interfere with their ability to care for themselves and be engaged in their health decisions.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-06-07\nTitle: Can COVID Cause You to Develop Asthma?\nContent:\nResearch suggests that asthma isn’t a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 infection. But some research also suggests that people with asthma may be at increased risk of long COVID and may experience worse asthma symptoms.\nThere’s currently no way to predict whether you’ll develop asthma and no way to prevent it. Still, people at greater risk of the disease may wish to avoid manageable risk factors like smoking and exposure to pollutants. Also, you can stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations to reduce your risk of infection and long COVID conditions.\nOne small 2022 study involving children hospitalized for COVID-19 found that about · 41.5% of them developed asthma-like symptoms. But that study also found that the risk of developing asthma was higher in children with a family history. This may be due to the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the airways in your lungs.\nBut some research also suggests that people with asthma may be at increased risk of long COVID and may experience worse asthma symptoms. A 2022 study found that people with asthma were at a higher risk of specific symptoms for up to 180 days, including: ... 2022 study found that, even with mild to moderate COVID symptoms, some people with asthma developed worse symptoms in the long term. This worsening of symptoms was enough to require a change in medication. There are isolated reports of people developing asthma or having an asthma attack after receiving the COVID vaccine.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Asthma and COVID-19: a dangerous liaison? | Asthma Research and ...\nContent:\nIn comparison, non-type 2 asthma is more frequent in older adults, particularly in women over 35 [98] and presents with a different risk profile in terms of comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 and progression to severe COVID-19 outcomes [38]. Expression of ACE2, the co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, varies with age [81]. Because Type-2 asthma sufferers tend to be younger than those with other comorbidities, the age factor probably explains why patients with asthma may not be at greater risk.\nHere we aim to review the latest evidence on the links between asthma and COVID-19 and provide reasoned answers to current concerns, such as the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severe COVID-19 stratified by asthmatic patients, the contribution of type-2 vs. non-type-2 asthma and asthma-COPD overlap to the risk of COVID-19 development. We also address the potential role of both standard anti-inflammatory asthma therapies and new biological agents for severe asthma, such as mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes.\nThis wide aspect could be further dissected in several questions that need to be addressed: 1) are asthmatics at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severe COVID-19? 2) could different asthma endotypes (type 2 asthma vs. non-type 2 asthma) carry a different risk profile in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 development, and progression to severe disease outcomes?\nIn conclusion, there is great variability in the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in different countries; in most countries patients with asthma were not reported with higher, but rather similar or lower rates of COVID-19 infection, compared with the general population in the corresponding area, probably due to multiple factors including a low proportion of non-type 2 phenotypes [38]. Indeed, a Korean nationwide cohort showed that patients with non-allergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity than patients with allergic asthma [46]. Results are heterogeneous when examining the association between asthma and severity of COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Asthma in Adult Patients with COVID-19. Prevalence and Risk of ...\nContent:\nThe lack of known biological mechanisms notwithstanding, data from the studies included in our analyses do not clearly show an altered risk of COVID-19 morbidity among adults with asthma. Our study has several limitations. Asthma diagnosis criteria were often not specified, or otherwise varied from self-report to physician diagnosis to use of asthma medication, likely resulting in an unknown degree of misclassification. The type of asthma (atopic, nonatopic) was rarely specified, a limitation given patients with atopic asthma may be less susceptible to increased COVID-19 morbidity (52, 57, 125).\nOur study has several limitations. Asthma diagnosis criteria were often not specified, or otherwise varied from self-report to physician diagnosis to use of asthma medication, likely resulting in an unknown degree of misclassification. The type of asthma (atopic, nonatopic) was rarely specified, a limitation given patients with atopic asthma may be less susceptible to increased COVID-19 morbidity (52, 57, 125). The prevalence of asthma in people with COVID-19 also varied greatly across regions, and from sample to sample within regions.\nIn addition to advanced age, suspected risk factors for developing severe illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection include the presence of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, certain malignancies, and diabetes (3). Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that afflicts over 330 million people worldwide (4). Because SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus, people with asthma are apprehensive that they may be at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 and suffer poorer outcomes.\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus, people with asthma are apprehensive that they may be at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 and suffer poorer outcomes. Among younger patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States, obesity, asthma, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities (5).

Rare medical conditions, including many conditions that mostly affect children, may not be included on the list below. We will update the list as we learn more. A person with a condition that is not listed may still be at greater risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 than other people who do not have the condition.\nIt is important that you talk with your healthcare provider about your risk. Having cancer can make you more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Treatments for many types of cancer can weaken your body’s ability to fight off disease. At this time, based on available studies, having a history of cancer may increase your risk.\nIf you or your family member are at high risk for severe illness, wear a mask or respirator with greater protection in public indoor spaces if you are in an area with a high COVID-19 hospital admission level. Talk with your healthcare provider about wearing a mask in a medium COVID-19 hospital admission level. If you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and you are aged 50 years or older OR are at high risk of getting very sick, you may be eligible for treatment.\nIf you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and you are aged 50 years or older OR are at high risk of getting very sick, you may be eligible for treatment. Contact your healthcare provider and start treatment within the first few days of symptoms. You can also visit a Test to Treat location. Treatment can reduce your risk of hospitalization by more than 50% and also reduces the risk of death. This information is intended for a general audience. Healthcare professionals should see Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19 for more detailed information.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* There are different types of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19.

In addition, the federal Vaccines for Children Program provides immunization services for children younger than 19 years who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or Native American or Alaska Native.\nFor example, in Australia, where a high proportion of girls are vaccinated with Gardasil, the incidence of genital warts went down during the first 4 years of the vaccination program among young males—who were not being vaccinated at the time—as well as among young females (21). Further evidence that large-scale HPV vaccination confers protection for unvaccinated individuals comes from a 2019 meta-analysis of girls-only HPV vaccination programs in 14 high-income countries that included 60 million vaccinated people (22). That analysis showed that, up to 8 years after the start of vaccination, diagnoses of anogenital warts decreased by 31% among women aged 25–29 years, by 48% among boys aged 15–19 years, and by 32% among men aged 20–24 years, compared with the period before vaccination began.\nIn addition, the federal Vaccines for Children Program provides immunization services for children younger than 19 years who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or Native American or Alaska Native. Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil 9, offers the Merck Vaccine Patient Assistance Program, which provides Gardasil 9 for free to people aged 19 to 45 years who live in the United States, do not have health insurance, and have an annual household income less than a certain amount. If a single dose of HPV vaccine were effective, that would be an important advance.\nTo date, protection against infections with the targeted HPV types has been found to last for at least 10 years with Gardasil (18), up to 11 years with Cervarix (17), and at least 6 years with Gardasil 9 (19). Long-term studies of vaccine efficacy that are still in progress will help scientists better understand how long protection lasts (20). Like other immunizations that guard against viral infection, HPV vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that, in future encounters with HPV, bind to the virus and prevent it from infecting cells.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Risk of death following COVID-19 vaccination or positive SARS-CoV-2 ...\nContent:\nSeveral studies have reported associations between COVID-19 vaccination and risk of cardiac diseases, especially in young people; the impact on mortality, however, remains unclear.

Here, we show there is no significant increase in cardiac or all-cause mortality in the 12 weeks following COVID-19 vaccination compared to more than 12 weeks after any dose.\nPrevious studies have shown an increase in the risk of myocarditis and myopericarditis associated with mRNA vaccines including BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)8,11, and an increased risk of thrombotic and other rare cardiovascular events after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca)12,13. There is also evidence of a range of other rare neurological complications14. However, the absolute risk of severe complications is low and needs to be assessed against the increased risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection if unvaccinated15,16. The balance of risk and benefit is particularly important to determine in younger people, due to the lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and death in this age group17.\nSeveral other studies have highlighted the association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of myocarditis and other cardiac events.

The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 113,000 deaths, in mid-June, as state governments considered how to prevent the spread of the disease in schools once a vaccine is available.\nBut a meme circulating on Facebook and other versions on social media claim the bill does not give parents any opportunity to avoid vaccinations for their children. “My heart is with Colorado!” the meme reads. “They passed bill SB-163 removing exemptions for vaccines. Very horrendous bill. Students must take Flu, HPV AND COVID19 vaccine to attend school.” The HPV vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus. That’s wrong on several counts. First, the bill has not become law yet. As we noted, the current version must still be approved by the Colorado Senate and then be signed by the governor.\nIt is also not true that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines or that “students must take” vaccines “to attend school.” · Colorado state law currently requires any student under 18 to submit a certificate of immunization, a doctor-certified medical exemption, or a statement of religious or personal belief that bars immunization.

It is being conducted in Atlanta, Georgia, long considered to be the “Black Mecca.” Despite this moniker, Atlanta has been overlooked for inclusion in large-scale studies of Black cardiovascular health. Given the city’s diversity in African American’s SES (a highly potent social determinant of health) and the size of the Black population (nearly 2 million), Atlanta is an ideal location for studies of Black heterogeneity in cardiovascular (CV) health and resilience-defined operationally as unexpected good cardiovascular health (individual or neighborhood) in an environment of excess risk.16\nA more complete narrative would also emphasize that African Americans have been called upon to muster extraordinary strength of mind and body for the sake of psychological and physical survival.

But the problem is far from solved. Strategies geared toward reducing traditional cardiovascular risk factors alone have failed to close the gap, said Yancy. While heart disease cases and deaths have decreased among the general population, the burden of disease remains higher among black adults, whose lives are about 3.4 years shorter than those of white adults. Cardiovascular diseases account for 32% of the difference in life expectancy between black and white men and 43% of the difference between black and white women.\nCardiovascular diseases account for 32% of the difference in life expectancy between black and white men and 43% of the difference between black and white women. \"We've gone beyond, 'Get your blood pressure checked and treated,'\" he said. \"Yes, the traditional approaches are important, but we need to go deeper. There is something about the living experience of many African Americans that predisposes to hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\" Those stressors differ from patient to patient, said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice dean for population health and health equity at the University of California, San Francisco.\nResearchers have long understood that African Americans experience a disproportionate level of high blood pressure and heart disease. As they've sought to understand why, evidence has emerged demonstrating the powerful role persistent, excessive levels of stress can play in cardiovascular health. But getting rid of that stress won't be easy, they warn. \"For decades, we've understood full well the burden of hypertension – and the consequences of hypertension which are extraordinary in the African American community, more so than any other cohort in the world,\" said Dr.\nClyde Yancy, vice dean for diversity and inclusion and chief of cardiology for Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \"Race alone is not sufficient to explain this.\" By age 55, three-fourths of black men and women have developed high blood pressure, compared to just 55% of white men and 40% of white women. Yancy, a past president of the American Heart Association, said a growing body of research links high levels of stress in African American communities – stemming from causes such as poverty, discrimination, childhood trauma and living in high-crime areas – to higher levels of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, obesity and diabetes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-10-07\nTitle: For Black Americans, Resilience Key to Heart Health\nContent:\nIt suggests that feelings of optimism and a sense of purpose and control -- hallmarks of psychosocial resilience -- are more important to heart health than where people live, researchers said.

The seven measures include smoking, physical activity, diet, weight, blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure.\nLead researcher Tené Lewis, an associate professor at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, noted that differences in heart health between Black and white Americans have been documented for decades.

The findings were published Oct. 7 in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. \"We assumed that being both high on psychosocial resilience and living in a resilient neighborhood would be the most beneficial for cardiovascular health, yet what we found was that psychosocial resilience demonstrated the most robust association regardless of the neighborhood resilience measure,\" Lewis said in a journal news release.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-07\nTitle: Optimism, resilience may guard heart health in Black adults | ...\nContent:\nHe is a clinical psychologist and associate professor of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. \"Understanding which strengths matter most for Black Americans – and under which contexts – will allow us to develop the most appropriate and applicable public health interventions for this group.\"\nThe study, published Wednesday in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, measured cardiovascular health based on the AHA's Life's Simple 7: smoking status, physical activity, diet, weight, and levels of blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure.

Across the world, Duterte’s fellow illiberal populists have bungled the initial phase of the crisis, the period when they had time to listen to medical experts and put measures into place to reduce the spread of the virus.\nDuterte, like other illiberal populists, has fumbled his initial handling of the pandemic. The fallout could damage his popularity and legacy.

The US and Brazil lead the world in both confirmed cases and fatalities. “If you look at the worst cases around the world … all of these countries have been under the spell of one form of populism or another,” he told Al Jazeera. In the case of the Philippines, the spread of the disease, also known as COVID-19, had been a “double-edged sword” for Duterte, said Heydarian, who is author of the book, The Rise of Duterte – A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy.\nIt has been four years since Rodrigo Duterte took his oath as president of the Philippines, railing against the “erosion of faith and trust in government”, while riding on a populist wave by promising “real change” and “transparency” to the country of more than 100 million people. But as he enters his last two years in office on Tuesday, Duterte’s leadership has proven hollow, analysts have said, adding that his handling of the continuing coronavirus pandemic has exposed his lack of serious policy, leaving many Filipinos to fend for themselves even as the economy faces its most serious challenge in decades.\nEven after Duterte has completed with his term as president – in the Philippines, the president is allowed to serve only a single term – Africa of IBON Foundation, is concerned about the problems that may be left behind, including a record amount of debt. “The government was set to borrow a record 1.4 trillion pesos ($26.1bn) in 2020 even before the pandemic. If anything, COVID-19 even gives it a convenient cover for this,” he said.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, states that President Rodrigo Duterte claimed COVID-19 is only transmitted through contact with other people. However, health experts say the novel coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. This information contradicts the claim.\n\nInformation 2,3,4, published on various dates, discusses President Duterte's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on his legacy and the Philippines' political landscape. While it does not directly address the claim, it does provide context about Duterte's understanding of the virus and his response to it.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-30, states that Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based political science professor and analyst, noted that the pandemic \"has exposed the hollowness of right-wing populism\", citing Duterte as an example. This information does not directly address the claim, but it does provide context about Duterte's understanding of the virus and his response to it.\n\nIn summary, the information provided contradicts the claim that President Rodrigo Duterte said COVID-19 is only transmitted through contact with other people. Health experts say the novel coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects.\n\nTherefore, the claim is: **False**", "response": "FALSE."}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here).

Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body’s ability to fight infection.” · It is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body’s immune system. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “vitamin C improves the absorption of iron from plant-based foods and helps the immune system work properly to protect the body from disease” (here).\nMark Pochapin (here), a gastroenterologist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, said he did not think there was “really any significant health benefit to lactoferrin.” Like the CDC and the WHO, Dr. Pochapin advised that people “just be meticulous” about washing their hands, avoid touching their face, and keep social distancing. ...

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

While vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the immune system, no food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus. However, having a healthy diet can support immune function.\n\nInformation 2, published on February 8, 2021, discusses a study by the University of Rochester Medical Center, revealing that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is a study on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in milk. The study found that pasteurization effectively eliminates infectious virus titers in milk.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 28, 2020, states that Chinese researchers found that exposure to human breast milk helps kill the virus that causes Covid-19. The World Health Organization recommends mothers continue breastfeeding even if they have COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, proposes the use of Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not accurate. According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

This virus appears to have originated within Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17,18,19. In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705). Samples were stored in viral transport medium at −80 °C directly after collection.\nIn 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. This emerging human virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, and also appears to have originated in horseshoe bats20,21—with its full genome 96% similar to a viral sequence reported from Rhinolophus affinis20. Closely related sequences were also identified in Malayan pangolins22,23. A growing body of research has identified bats as the evolutionary sources of SARS—and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—CoVs13,14,24,25,26, and as the source of progenitors for the human CoVs, NL63 and 229E27,28.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-01-30\nTitle: False: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the ...\nContent:\nExplanation: The current analysis indicate that there is no <strong>pig</strong> element in <strong>the</strong> <strong>virus</strong>. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Wuhan</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> originated mostly from SARS <strong>and</strong> <strong>bats</strong>, not from <strong>pigs</strong>.

Pigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species.\nPigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species. Moreover, a team at Zhejiang University in the Chinese city of Hangzhou found that the SADS virus could infect cells from many organisms in a petri dish, including rodents, chickens, nonhuman primates and humans.

Nonetheless, civets may have amplified the virus and brought it closer to humans (35). Additional mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, common marmosets, grivets, and cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be infected under experimental inoculation, seroconvert, and display similar pathological signs as humans, and the monkeys and guinea pigs usually display mild clinical signs, while cats and golden hamsters show no clinical signs (36–44).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study conducted by Tufts University and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences found that bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports. Despite the decrease in EVALI with the arrival of COVID-19, EVALI should still be considered a differential diagnosis for people with COVID-19 for reasons outlined in this review.\nAlthough easily forgotten in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a major outbreak of vaping-related illness dominated public health concerns before the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. This narrative review describes vaping devices, summarizes the adverse health effects of vaping on the lungs and other systems, considers the potential interplay between vaping and COVID-19, and highlights gaps in knowledge about vaping that warrant further research.\nHospitalizations for EVALI reached a peak in late 2019 and rapidly declined to extremely low numbers of reported cases by January 2020, just before the initial identification of COVID-19 cases in the United States.47 Although vaping-related illness may have nearly disappeared as a consequence of increased public awareness resulting in risk reduction by users and by removal of vitamin E acetate from vaping products, a case report of a patient in April 2020 reminds clinicians that EVALI should remain in the differential diagnosis for young patients admitted with severe lung injury.48 Presenting symptoms of EVALI (dyspnea, cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) overlap with those of COVID-19,36,49,50 and during population surges of the pandemic there is a tendency to narrow diagnostic considerations.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is about a false claim on Facebook where pictures of a crying child and two adults in hospital beds were shared with the claim that the family members are infected with COVID-19.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ...

After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. FACT: Vaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months. Still, that doesn’t mean the immune system has checked out of the fight.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How long does immunity last after COVID-19 vaccination? | Gavi, ...\nContent:\nBecause of this, it has been too soon to say exactly how long these COVID-19 vaccines will protect people for, and whether we might need a booster shot further down the line. However, now the first evidence is emerging · On 1 April, Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time. The studies did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-09-27, explains how vaccines work and debunks myths about COVID-19 vaccines. It states that vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection against the disease without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track movement and do not contain microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, or nanowire semiconductors.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2023-09-22, provides further details on how COVID-19 vaccines work. Protein subunit vaccines contain pieces of the virus that causes COVID-19, and an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to the spike protein. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, it will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect against COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-12-13, explains how COVID-19 immunity works at this point in the pandemic. Antibodies produced after an infection or vaccination wane after a few months. Immunization is the most effective way to launch antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, states that it is too soon to say exactly how long COVID-19 vaccines will protect people for, but there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity can last for up to eight months, and vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting.\n\nClaim: The immunity produced by the COVID-19 vaccine only works for six months.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is mostly false. Information 1, published after the claim, states that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines drops to 14% after six months. However, Information 5, with no publication date, states that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Information 4, published after the claim, also explains that immunity from vaccines wanes after a few months, but this does not mean the immune system has checked out of the fight. Therefore, while the effectiveness of the vaccine may drop after six months, immunity is not limited to six months.", "response": "FALSE."}

With the highly transmissible Delta variant fueling yet another increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, the CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in parts of the U.S. where the coronavirus is surging.\nSince then, government and public health leaders have urged us to wear face masks even when walking around our neighborhoods alone, and told us to keep wearing them even after receiving the protection of highly effective vaccines.

Effect of weight reduction and cardiometabolic risk factor management on symptom burden and severity in patients with atrial fibrillation: A randomized clinical trial.\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. There is growing evidence that AF is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. In this review, we summarise epidemiological observations linking AF with cognitive outcomes, describe potential mechanisms and explore the impact of AF treatments on cognitive decline and dementia.\nSome studies have found that higher CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which are stratification schemes commonly used to inform anticoagulant treatment in individuals with AF, predict dementia in these patients.[22,29] This association is not surprising given that age, possibly the strongest predictor of dementia, is part of the scores. Dementia-specific risk models are likely to provide more accurate predictions.\nOral anticoagulation is a mainstay of the treatment of patients with AF.

Catheter ablation is a procedure that makes small scars in heart tissue to prevent abnormal electrical signals from causing rapid and irregular heart rhythms, or atrial fibrillation. The findings could lead to changes in how patients with atrial fibrillation and carotid arterial disease are treated, even if they traditionally haven’t been candidates for more aggressive treatment, such as an ablation.\nThe findings could lead to changes in how patients with atrial fibrillation and carotid arterial disease are treated, even if they traditionally haven’t been candidates for more aggressive treatment, such as an ablation. “Often in medicine, higher-risk patients are less often referred for an invasive procedure due to concerns of procedural risk,” said T.\nResearchers found that performing catheter ablation to correct irregular heartbeats in patients with both atrial fibrillation and carotid arterial disease resulted in a lower five-year risk of dementia or stroke and dementia alone, compared to similar patients who didn’t have the procedure done.

Such theories circulate perhaps because people have been seeking some more tangible (rather than literally invisible) causes for such massive social and economic disruptions.1\nA lengthy video, published on YouTube on 2 April by the notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke, claims that COVID-19 itself is a scam and is instead caused by 5G technology. Eventually taken down by YouTube, but also republished through other video sharing sites, the video reached some 224 spaces with at least 2.8 million followers; Icke also released a further video, repeating claims that COVID-19 itself did not exist and that 5G was instead preventing human bodies from absorbing oxygen, thus causing COVID-like symptoms.\nSuch stories – which might be classified as state-sanctioned counter-propaganda – cover the use of 5G technology for telemedicine in Chinese hospitals, report on the deployment of 5G-controlled robots and drones to support doctors and patients and control the lockdown, or reaffirm the country’s commitment to the rollout of 5G technology in spite of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Our focus on Facebook and our search terms in Latin characters for this study necessarily mean that we are unlikely to capture any Chinese media content designed for domestic consumption in China – but from the data we do have it is clear that Chinese state media did embark on a concerted effort to present the benefits of 5G to a world audience, not least in countries where 5G conspiracy theories circulated widely.\nAlthough small themselves (with fewer than 500 followers in each case), they may have served as an entry point for this more violent aggression against 5G technology into the United Kingdom. A lengthy video, published on YouTube on 2 April by the notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke, claims that COVID-19 itself is a scam and is instead caused by 5G technology.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nFacebook says it’s significantly expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus. The company once simply flagged these posts as having been fact-checked, using third-party partners like Lead Stories and Full Fact. Now posts that include false claims about 5G and Covid-19 are being taken down, along with other false coronavirus-related content.\nA spokesperson told Recode that the platform is prioritizing taking down posts that include “a call to action that could potentially cause harm.” The company says that since March 18, it’s taken down more than 2,200 tweets violating its rules around Covid-19 content. There’s a chance this struggle to contain a dangerous conspiracy theory will endure. Part of what drove the 5G coronavirus conspiracy to the mainstream was a lack of good information about how the virus spreads and how it works, questions that scientists are still working to answer.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak.\nOthers float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis ...\nContent:\nIn the first week of January, some social media users pointed to 5G as being the cause of COVID-19 or accelerating its spread. The issue became a trending topic and appeared visible to all users on Twitter within the United Kingdom. Since then, multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking the two together. The conspiracy has been of such a serious nature that, in Birmingham and Merseyside, United Kingdom, 5G masts were torched over concerns associating this technology and the spread of the disease according to the British Broadcasting Corporation [9]. More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10]. This is unwelcome damage especially at a time when hospitals are required to operate with maximum efficiency.\nThe majority of influential users tweeting about 5G and COVID-19 consisted of members of the public sharing their views and opinions or news articles and videos supporting their cause. A key feature of the accounts was that they were actively engaged in sharing conspiracy theories; their bios included words such as “uncover” and “truth.”\nInterestingly, results show that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account (created on January 24, 2012), whose sole purpose was to raise awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G, and the account was named “5gcoronavirus19.” This account was in the group labeled “activism account” in Figure 1. The account creation date appears to be 2012, which suggests that a previously created account was converted, as Twitter allows users to change their user handle and username.

Protesters blocked access to the site and had to be cleared by police (Bibby, 2020). Unlike celebrities’ social media posts mentioned earlier, no clear links were made to COVID-19. Indeed, ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020b, 2020c) criticised the media for making the link, arguing that ‘we were around long before CV!!’ However, the willingness to breach regulations and hold a large-scale gathering during a pandemic implied that they regarded the risks caused by 5G as of greater significance than coronavirus.\nWhile many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors. Perhaps surprisingly, Australia became something of a global hotspot for these actions, many of which appear to be coordinated (or at least actively supported) by ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020a) and other associated groups (e.g.\nThere are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer.\nThe second and more prominent conspiracy moves well away from these historical concerns with EMF exposure. Instead, it argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19. There are a number of variations around this conspiracy theory. Among the more notable of them are the erroneous claims that (a) COVID-19 is a made up pandemic to cover up the deleterious effects of 5G radiation (Asher Hamilton, 2020a) and (b) that COVID-19 emerged from Wuhan because it had ‘been the guinea-pig city for 5G’ (Adams, 2020).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides context for the claim by discussing the popularity of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology. The notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke is mentioned as having published a video claiming that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology, which reached millions of followers. Chinese state media is also mentioned as having embarked on a concerted effort to present the benefits of 5G technology to a world audience.\n\nInformation 2 discusses Facebook's efforts to combat conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that 5G causes the virus. The article mentions that Facebook has expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus, including those that claim 5G and COVID-19 are related.\n\nInformation 3 provides a social network analysis of the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter. The analysis shows that the conspiracy theory became a trending topic in the UK and that multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking 5G and COVID-19. The analysis also shows that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account named \"5gcoronavirus19,\" which was created in 2012 and had the sole purpose of raising awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G.\n\nInformation 4 debunks the claim that 5G caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The article mentions that cities in South Korea and the US had 5G networks before Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began. The article also mentions that Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network.\n\nInformation 5 discusses the COVID-19, 5G conspiracies and infrastructural futures. The article mentions that while many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a video says COVID-19 is caused by 5G is true. Information 1 and 3 mention that David Icke, a notorious conspiracy theorist, published a video claiming that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology. Information 3 also mentions that a dedicated propaganda account named \"5gcoronavirus19\" was created in 2012 and had the sole purpose of raising awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology.

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)).

ACTIV-4: Antithrombotics, one of ACTIV’s several master protocols, is part of this effort. The goal of this suite of adaptive trials has been to evaluate how blood thinners and anti-clotting medications can minimize risks for severe complications from COVID.\nACTIV-4 research has provided clinicians with guidance for treating and reducing risks for severe COVID outcomes related to inflammation and blood clotting · When SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019, researchers quickly assembled to understand its effects and figure out how to stop its spread.\nThese findings were supported by thousands of patients who participated in the ACTIV4 inpatient trial and other international trials, including the Randomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) and Antithrombotic Therapy to Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 (ATTACC). Researchers found that 4% of the adults who received heparin had better outcomes than those who received the preventative dose. They were less likely to receive intensive care and more likely to be discharged from the hospital within 21 days. Following these findings, the NIH clinical care guidelines were immediately updated to recommend physicians provide a full dose of heparin to hospitalized patients with moderate illness.\n“Already,” Kindzelski said, “the outcomes of the ACTIV-4 trials have provided much needed and timely clinical guidance to minimize COVID-associated thrombotic events.” ...

At the state level, similar two key factors contribute to our ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble model. First, the introduction of the bi-disease constituent model, ARGOX-Local, effectively combines Google search data, Influenza-like Illness activity data, and COVID-19 cases/deaths to produce state-level COVID-19 cases/deaths estimates or %ILI estimates.\nFirst, the introduction of the bi-disease constituent model, ARGOX-Local, effectively combines Google search data, Influenza-like Illness activity data, and COVID-19 cases/deaths to produce state-level COVID-19 cases/deaths estimates or %ILI estimates. This bi-disease ARGOX-Local is an intermediate method that connects Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 information in geographical proximity, and is a joint COVID-ILI method that uses each other’s growth trend to help the other, which can efficiently detect upcoming surges and peaking periods.\nThese methods are adapted directly from the established Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 predictions with minimal changes, which reduces the chance of over-fitting. The previously proposed winner-takes-all ensemble framework44 also naturally incorporates bi-disease ARGOX-Local as one additional constituent model, and is able to robustly select the “best” estimate among the sub-models during rapid changing dynamics.\nFortunately, by recognizing the correlation between Influenza-like Illness activities and COVID-19 growth trend at both national and state levels, %ILI and COVID-19 cases/deaths are able to rely more on each other when Google search queries’ signal degenerates, which enable robust estimations and fast recoveries from overshooting.\n\nThe claim was published in 2020-06-26, stating that COVID-19 spread can be estimated by looking at past trends of influenza-like illnesses. To evaluate the claim, let's summarize the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2024-01-05, discusses the weekly influenza surveillance report by CDC, including information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity. The report highlights the importance of evaluating syndromic surveillance data in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of respiratory virus activity.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2022-07-29, explains the differences between COVID-19 and the flu, including symptoms, complications, and the viruses that cause them.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2022-11-23, is the claim in question, which was originally published in 2020-06-26. It discusses estimating COVID-19 spread by looking at past trends of influenza-like illnesses.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2022-09-28, explains the similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19, including their causes, symptoms, and complications. It also mentions that COVID-19 spreads more easily than flu.\n\nInformation 5, without a publication date, discusses joint COVID-19 and influenza-like illness forecasts in the United States, including the use of ARGO-Nat and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble models that combine Google search data, Influenza-like Illness activity data, and COVID-19 cases/deaths to produce estimates.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim (Information 3) was published in 2020-06-26, while more comprehensive information about COVID-19 and influenza-like illnesses was published later (Information 1, 2, 4, and 5). However, Information 5 does mention the use of Influenza-like Illness activity data in COVID-19 forecasts, which supports the idea of using past trends of influenza-like illnesses to estimate COVID-19 spread.\n\nConsidering the information available, the claim (Information 3) is partially supported, as it is plausible to use past trends of influenza-like illnesses to estimate COVID-19 spread. However, a more comprehensive understanding of both COVID-19 and influenza-like illnesses has been gained since the claim was published in 2020-06-26.

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective.

It mentions a false claim circulating on social media that Walmart has adopted a staggered shopping schedule based on age groups. The claim suggests that Walmart has designated specific days for different age groups to shop. However, the fact is that Walmart has only introduced special shopping hours for customers aged 60 and above, an hour before the store opens every Tuesday.\n\nInformation 2, also published on April 3, 2020, is from an undisclosed source, but it appears to be a fact-checking article.

The article mentions that the post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim that Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule based on age groups is false, as confirmed by multiple fact-checking articles. Walmart has only introduced special shopping hours for customers aged 60 and above, an hour before the store opens every Tuesday. The false claim has been circulating on social media in the form of an image, and it has been shared extensively on various platforms. However, Walmart has not announced any such measure, and the image does not originate from the company.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

The 2009 H1N1 virus is not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal flu vaccine because it was identified after manufacturers had started making the seasonal flu vaccine.\nPersons who have some antibody from previous vaccination or exposure to infection with another related flu strain will have much greater increases in antibody to flu vaccines. Studies that looked at blood samples taken from children before the pandemic indicate that very few children had any measurable immunity against 2009 H1N1 prior to the outbreak Therefore, all children younger than 10 should get 2 doses regardless of whether they ever have been given seasonal influenza vaccine\nSo, increased activity from either seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 or both are still possible this season.

It was phase III clinically trialled in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey and relies on traditional technology similar to other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, another Chinese vaccine, and Covaxin, an Indian vaccine.\nCoronaVac is being used in vaccination campaigns in various countries in Asia, South America, Central America, and Eastern Europe. By April 2021, Sinovac had a production capacity of 2 billion doses per year. It is currently being manufactured at several facilities in China, with overseas manufacture planned for Brazil in September 2021 and eventually Egypt and Hungary.\nIn July 2020, Sinovac began Phase III trials to evaluate efficacy and safety on 9,000 volunteer healthcare professionals in Brazil, collaborating with Butantan Institute. On 19 October, São Paulo Governor João Doria said the first results of the clinical study conducted in Brazil proved that among the vaccines being tested in the country, CoronaVac is the safest, the one with the best and most promising immunization rates.\nIn early January 2021, Brazilian health officials announced that the vaccine had an efficacy of 78%. One week later, they revised this figure to 50.4%, stating that the revised figure now included \"very mild\" cases of COVID-19 among trial participants which were omitted in the earlier analysis. Ricardo Palácios, medical director of Brazil's Instituto Butantan, said Sinovac's relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to more rigorous standards for what counted as an infection among trial participants.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-03-08\nTitle: Exclusive: Study in Brazil indicates Sinovac vaccine works against ...\nContent:\nPreliminary data from a study <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong> indicates that the COVID-19 <strong>vaccine</strong> developed by China&#x27;s <strong>Sinovac</strong> Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong>, a source familiar with the study told Reuters on Monday.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a date, is about a city in Brazil using the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains the CDC's H1N1 flu vaccine, including its name and the fact that it doesn't indicate how long the vaccine will work or the year it should be administered.

The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check by Reuters discussing a social media claim that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar eliminates the coronavirus. The claim states that the coronavirus remains in the throat for four days before reaching the lungs and that gargling with salt or vinegar can eliminate the virus. Reuters found no official government or medical advisory recommending the use of saline or vinegar to eliminate the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by 15min.lt stating that there is no proof that salt and/or vinegar can kill the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not provided, is a study discussing the effectiveness of various gargle formulations, including salt water, against SARS-CoV-2. The study found that salt water was not proven effective. However, gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SARS-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-11-07, is a study discussing the role of saline regimens on symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2. The study found that both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by FactCheck.org stating that gargling water with salt or vinegar does not eliminate the coronavirus.\n\nClaim: Publication date: 2020-03-16, Content: Gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar kills SARS-CoV-2.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nAccording to Information 1, 2, and 5, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar eliminates or kills SARS-CoV-2. Information 3 also states that salt water was not proven effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, Information 4 discusses a study that found both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study does not support the claim that gargling with salt water kills the virus. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Although vaccination does provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection, these findings suggest that COVID-19 can cause long-term damage to the immune system and make someone less able to fight off reinfection.\nT cells are an important part of the immune system. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines give these cells information about SARS-CoV-2 so that they can attack the virus and any infected cells to keep the infection from spreading. T cells can also alert B cells, which produce antibodies against the virus.\nThese findings suggest that COVID-19 causes long-term damage to the immune system, even after recovery and vaccination against COVID-19. Future research can examine how to strengthen T cells to better protect people who have previously gotten sick. However, no matter whether a person is vaccinated before or after they get COVID-19, vaccination against future cases of COVID-19 will still provoke a stronger immune response than the response of unvaccinated people.\nPeople who were vaccinated but had contracted COVID-19 before their vaccination had a lower number of CD8+ T cells, and people who had never been vaccinated had the lowest amount. The T cells in those two groups were also less able to recruit B cells to fight future infections. These findings suggest that COVID-19 causes long-term damage to the immune system, even after recovery and vaccination against COVID-19.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2022-06-05\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nIt has been hypothesized that there will be an increase in cardiovascular diseases, especially acute coronary syndromes, caused by the spike proteins in genetic vaccines [18, 19]. Besides the risk of infections owing to lowered immune functions, there is a possible risk of unknown organ damage caused by the vaccine that has remained hidden without apparent clinical presentations, mainly in the circulatory system. Therefore, careful risk assessments prior to surgery and invasive medical procedures are essential. Randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm these clinical observations. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nRecently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.\nThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals. According to European Medicines Agency recommendations, frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible.\nThe decrease in immunity can be caused by several factors such as N1-methylpseudouridine, the spike protein, lipid nanoparticles, antibody-dependent enhancement, and the original antigenic stimulus. These clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: 5 Things You Should Know about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nWe have multiple years of experience showing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the strains of virus causing most of the disease change and immunity wanes over time. The changes from last year’s vaccines are small, but they help make the vaccine better at targeting the virus strains circulating now and give your immune system a boost.\nBottom line: CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against potentially serious COVID-19 outcomes this fall and winter. This is especially important for older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who are at highest risk for severe illness.\nThe virus is constantly changing, and our immunity, whether from vaccines or previous infections, fades. Getting updated vaccines like the updated COVID-19 vaccines that are available now continues to be important, especially for older people and those with certain medical conditions.\nImmune protection from both vaccines and previous infections can decline over time and as new variants emerge.

COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nVaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA.

In this case, it’s seamless merging of fact and fantasy. All of the 19 CEOs in the meme have, in fact, stepped down from their posts. That’s not fake. But their departures had nothing to do with coronavirus, and many took place long before the first COVID-19 cluster was identified.\nAccording to Business Insider, the CEO of the tobacco company Altria, Howard Willard, resigned due to complications from contracting the illness; while the head of SeaWorld recently resigned due to the financial hit the park was taking from having to close down; and there are rumors that Disney head Bob Iger unexpectedly stepped down over a year before his planned retirement because he knew how bad the pandemic would be. And there’s another conspiracy that Q believers have ignored entirely—one that’s already been proven to have come true.\nSo yes, while more CEOs have resigned in the last few years than since the Great Recession, most were in the works long before the coronavirus pandemic hit. They had nothing to do with the actual pandemic—and not the behind-the-scenes war between good and evil that Q believers talk about. The real conspiracies—be it insider trading or that “man of the people” Donald Trump made a great number of rich people more wealthy who are now they are cashing out before things collapse—apparently just isn’t as fun.\nAnd we’re all too distracted by the torrent of pandemic headlines to realize what’s really going on here: Deep state-aligned industry titans are running for the hills before they’re brought down by President Donald Trump and his team of patriots. Supposedly. Check this out. No coincidences.

Parker had served as an airline CEO for 20 years. The company’s president, Robert Isom, will take over on March 31. Parker will serve as Chairman of the carrier’s board. “It likely would have happened sooner, but the global pandemic — and the devastating impact it had on our industry — delayed those plans,” Parker stated in a note to his employees.\nOn January 20, 2021, Michael Pack, CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media including Voice of America resigned at President Biden’s request, two hours after being sworn in. Often accused for partisanship, Pack pointed fingers at journalists for anti-Trump bias. He initiated investigations into bias claims and tried to sack senior “deep state” executives.\nUnfortunately, many CEO’s are misaligned with corporate objectives. Some make poor or even fatal decisions under stress. Others allow their character flaws to spin out of control. Too many CEO’s sabotage their own best efforts and fail to bring their best selves to the workplace. They can experience untold embarrassment, despair, and untimely resignations.\nSilbermann shared “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see… Bill is a great leader for this transition.” · On June 22, 2022, Jose Mauro Coelho, the CEO of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras stepped down. His resignation occurred amidst political pressure from lawmakers and President Jair Bolsonaro due to rising fuel prices.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 are from the same source and provide details about a Facebook post made by Cody Harris on March 12, 2020. The post claimed that a series of CEO resignations before the novel coronavirus outbreak were linked to a global conspiracy. The post was debunked as false by fact-checkers, who pointed out that there was no evidence to support the claim and that many of the CEOs mentioned had not actually stepped down from their positions.\n\nInformation 3 is about a different claim, made in December 2021, that a series of high-level corporate resignations were linked to the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. This claim was also debunked as false by fact-checkers, who found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the claim made by Cody Harris. It explains that while some of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim were real, they had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or any global conspiracy. Instead, they were due to a variety of factors, including personal health issues and company financial problems.\n\nInformation 5 is not directly related to the claim made by Cody Harris, but it provides some general context about CEO resignations. It notes that some CEOs resign due to poor decision-making, character flaws, or political pressure.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim made by Cody Harris that CEO resignations are linked to a global conspiracy is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and many of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim have been debunked as false. Additionally, the fact that some CEOs resign for a variety of reasons unrelated to any conspiracy supports the conclusion that the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

This is a misunderstanding of a quote from him about the limitations of PCR testing in general, to find out about the exact levels of a virus in a sample, not whether or not the sample contained the virus.\nThere is absolutely no evidence that the inventor of the PCR process said this. PCR is used for a number of scientific processes, and in general, it amplifies bits of genetic information so that they can be detected within samples.

PCR tests are used in Ireland and many other countries, and involve taking a swab from someone’s throat and nose and then using PCR – polymerase chain reaction – to detect the genetic material of the virus that causes Covid-19.\nAnother Facebook post, which has been shared 104 times, said that Mullins was the “inventor of the PCR Covid test” and that it was “not made to detect any kind of infectious disease. It’s just there to pick up a signature of your DNA and RNA”. A post shared on a Facebook page on 24 November, which has been viewed over 15,000 times, said:\nOne post, which has been shared 250 times, said: “Scary stuff. HSE says the PCR tests use 40-45 amplification cycles. That means it’s totally unreliable and false positives will be off the charts. Could be a dose you had months ago. I think up to 30 is max. recommended.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless – Bulgarian ...\nContent:\nBut looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2. At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:\nThis indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction. But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”\nAnd as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.” · So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, did not think alike.\nBut not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” (see below).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-11-13\nTitle: Fact check: Inventor of method used to test for COVID-19 didn’t ...\nContent:\nSocial media users have been sharing a quote attributed to the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, currently being used to detect COVID-19, which says “PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at all”. This quote appears not to be a direct quote from the inventor, Kary Mullis, has lost some context and does not mean COVID-19 testing is fraudulent, as suggested by some social media posts.\nThe post begins with the words “COVID-19 TEST a FRAUD?”, then introduces the alleged quote from Mullis, who invented the PCR method in 1985 and was recognized for this achievement by being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 (here).\nThe context around the quote shows Lauritsen is not saying PCR tests do not work. Instead, he is clarifying that PCR identifies substances qualitatively not quantitatively, detecting the genetic sequences of viruses, but not the viruses themselves: “PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers.\nEven if Mullis had voiced a similar statement before his death in 2019, this quote does not mean the PCR test is unable to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - rather that it cannot determine whether the individual tested is infectious.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-08-31, is from Chequeado and states that there is no record of Kary Mullis, the creator of PCR tests, making a statement against their effectiveness.\n* Information 2, published on 2020-10-23, is from FullFact and explains that PCR tests are not designed to detect any type of infectious disease, but rather to pick up a signature of DNA and RNA of the person being tested. It also mentions that PCR tests are specific to the DNA they are testing for, whether that's of a person or a virus.\n* Information 3, published on 2020-11-26, is from TheJournal.ie and states that social media posts have claimed that Kary Mullis said PCR tests cannot be used to accurately identify Covid-19 and that they return a high number of false positives.\n* Information 4, the publication date is not available, is from a Bulgarian website and states that PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.\n* Information 5, published on 2020-11-13, is from AFP Fact Check and states that a quote attributed to Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR method, has been taken out of context and that PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at all is not a direct quote from Mullis.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that the creator of PCR tests said that they do not detect the new coronavirus is false. Kary Mullis, the inventor of PCR tests, did not make a statement against the effectiveness of PCR tests in detecting the new coronavirus. PCR tests are designed to pick up a signature of DNA and RNA of the person being tested, and are specific to the DNA they are testing for, whether that's of a person or a virus. The claim that PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at all is not a direct quote from Mullis and has been taken out of context. PCR tests are the most reliable method available today to rule out or confirm COVID-19 and are being recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).", "response": "FALSE."}

It did not go smoothly. - POLITICO\nContent:\nIt was April 2009 and the 3-month-old Obama administration was desperately grappling with the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression when homeland security adviser John Brennan arrived at the Oval Office to warn the president and Vice President Joe Biden of a new crisis: H1N1, the swine flu virus, was showing signs of rapid spread in Mexico, while cases were popping up in California and Texas. Brennan pointed out that the Spanish flu — the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history — was an H1N1 strain. “It made their eyebrows go up,” Brennan says now, recalling Biden’s reaction in particular.\nAs he faces daily criticism of his response to the coronavirus — the most severe pandemic in a century — Trump has tried to turn the spotlight on the Obama-Biden administration’s handling of the swine flu. In tweets, cable news interviews and news briefings, Trump has suggested Obama and Biden completely bungled the response. On March 12, when there were only about 40 recorded coronavirus deaths in the United States, Trump tweeted: “Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people.\nObama, seeking to learn from his predecessors’ experiences, invited members of the Ford administration to visit the White House and discuss their own fateful dance with the swine flu in 1976, when a variant of H1N1 broke out on a U.S. military base and President Gerald Ford ordered a nationwide vaccination program.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2009-04-30\nTitle: Vice President Joe Biden's Remarks on Swine Flu Draw Criticism ...\nContent:\nBiden's comments came just hours before the White House announced that a Department of Energy official who had traveled to Mexico City with Secretary Energy Chu exhibited flu-like symptoms upon his return, but tested negative for the swine flu.

At a news conference Wednesday evening, President Obama said Americans who may be sick should avoid airplanes and \"any system of public transportation where you're confined,\" but the vice president today took it one step further.\nIf you're out in the middle of the field and someone sneezes, that's one thing. If you're in a closed aircraft, a closed container, a closed car, a closed classroom, that's another thing.\" Biden's comments came just hours before the White House announced that a Department of Energy official who had traveled to Mexico City with Secretary Energy Chu exhibited flu-like symptoms upon his return, but tested negative for the swine flu.\nWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the individual did not come within six feet of Obama but was present at a dinner with him and did come into contact with Chu. Gibbs added that about 10 staffers who were on the Mexico City trip with Obama consulted doctors for flu-like symptoms, but none of them tested positive for the swine flu.

While the Obama administration's response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 had some issues, as mentioned in Information 1 and 5, it is not accurate to label it as horrendous. Furthermore, then-Vice President Biden did not always reverse his stance on the issue, as suggested by the claim.

Science, abg6296, this issue p. 1439 · Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is still under debate.\nAirborne transmission is one of the main pathways for the transmission of respiratory viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Wearing face masks has been widely advocated to mitigate transmission. Masks are thought to protect people in two ways: (i) source control, reducing the emission and spread of respiratory viruses through airborne droplets and aerosols, and (ii) wearer protection, reducing the inhalation of airborne respiratory viruses.\nIn this work, we develop a quantitative model of airborne virus exposure that can explain these contrasting results and provide a basis for quantifying the efficacy of face masks. We show that mask efficacy strongly depends on airborne virus abundance. On the basis of direct measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples and population-level infection probabilities, we find that the virus abundance in most environments is sufficiently low for masks to be effective in reducing airborne transmission.\nUnder this assumption, wearing a mask would have the same effect on the transmission of a virus disease at any level of infection probability. Our analysis, however, shows that the efficacy of face masks depends strongly on the level of infection probability and virus abundance: Masks reduce the infection probability by as much as their filter efficiency for respiratory particles in the virus-limited regime but much less in the virus-rich regime (Fig.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2013-08-06, provides recommendations on preventing the transmission of COVID-19, including wearing high-quality face masks, washing hands, keeping surfaces clean, and getting vaccinated.

According to the standards of NIOSH, filtering respirators can be classified as the N95, N99 and N100 masks, which can respectively block at least 95%, 99% and 99.97% of particles with median diameter of 0.3 μm from entering (CDC, 2020).\nThe role of community‐wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic due to SARS‐CoV‐2.

Terms searched were “face masks”, “surgical mask” and “N95” in combination with the terms “risk” and “adverse effects” as well as “side effects”. The selection criteria of the papers were based on our above definition of risk and adverse effect of masks.\nIn a laboratory experiment (evidence level IIa study), it was demonstrated that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses using virus-free aerosols [118]. In this study, the FFP2-equivalent N95 mask performed significantly better in protection (8–12 times more effective) than the surgical mask, but neither mask type established reliable, hypothesis-generated protection against corona and influenza viruses. Both mask types could be penetrated unhindered by aerosol particles with a diameter of 0.08 to 0.2 μm. Both the SARS-CoV-2 pathogens with a size of 0.06 to 0.14 μm [119] and the influenza viruses with 0.08 to 0.12 μm are unfortunately well below the mask pore sizes [118].\nKeywords: personal protective equipment, masks, N95 face mask, surgical mask, risk, adverse effects, long-term adverse effects, contraindications, health risk assessment, hypercapnia, hypoxia, headache, dyspnea, physical exertion, MIES syndrome · At the beginning of the spread of the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2, it was necessary to make far-reaching decisions even without available explicit scientific data.\nAt least Germany pointed out that wearers of certain types of masks such as the common fabric masks (community masks) cannot rely on them to protect them or others from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [114]. However, scientists not only complain about the lack of evidence for fabric masks in the scope of a pandemic [16,110], but also about the high permeability of fabric masks with particles and the potential risk of infection they pose [108,109]. Ordinary fabric masks with a 97% penetration for particle dimensions of ≥0.3 μm are in stark contrast to medical-type surgical masks with a 44% penetration. In contrast, the N95 mask has a penetration rate of less than 0.01% for particles ≥ 0.3 μm in the laboratory experiment [108,115].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: An evidence review of face masks against COVID-19 | Proceedings ...\nContent:\nMa et al., Exhaled breath is a significant source of SARS-CoV-2 emission. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20115154 (2 June 2020). ...

The study found that consistent use of face masks or respirators, including N95/KN95, in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, discusses the effectiveness of masks in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, stating that masks are highly effective in most environments because airborne virus abundance is limited. Compared to N95 or FFP2 respirators, surgical and similar masks exhibit higher and more variable penetration rates.\n\nInformation 3, also with no specific publication date, focuses on N95 masks and their effectiveness in filtering particles, including those of SARS-CoV-2. N95 masks can block at least 95% of particles with a median diameter of 0.3 μm.\n\nInformation 4, published up to and including 2020-10-31, is a review of scientific studies and publications on adverse effects and risks of different types of mouth-nose-covering masks. The review found that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses using virus-free aerosols.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a review of evidence on face masks against COVID-19. The review states that exhaled breath is a significant source of SARS-CoV-2 emission and that normal speaking produces thousands of oral fluid particles, including aerosols and droplets, that can harbor respiratory pathogens.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published on 2020-06-01, states that scientific studies have found the use of N95 face masks to be ineffective in restricting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that the lack of oxygen from using the mask causes severe respiratory problems.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nThe claim is false based on the available information and current scientific knowledge. The studies and information presented show that N95 masks are effective in filtering virus-sized particles and reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is no evidence to support the claim that the lack of oxygen from using N95 masks causes severe respiratory problems. In fact, Information 4 states that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, but it does not support the claim that N95 masks are ineffective in restricting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, Information 1 specifically found that consistent use of N95 masks in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Therefore, the claim is false based on the available information and current scientific knowledge.", "response": "FALSE."}

They also apparently decided to protect their intellectual property along the way.\nThere are two lessons I want to draw from this on-going patent fear-mongering. The first is that “coronavirus” is not a word that only applies to the agent behind COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a subfamily in the grand classification of viruses. They include our current enemy, SARS-CoV-2, but also a different coronavirus that caused SARS nearly twenty years ago, and the coronavirus that produces the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nA French conspiracy video making the rounds points to a coronavirus patent held by the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Université Paris VII (EP 1 694 829 B1).

When more is understood about how antibodies reflect protective immunity and how serostatus correlates with medical sequelae, the value of antibody testing at the individual level can be re-evaluated (see Outstanding Questions).\nHowever, antibody levels have been shown to wane over time. Therefore, an individual who was exposed several months before taking a serology test may have a negative test result. Recent public discussion has given many the false impression that a seropositive antibody test result indicates a return to ‘normal’ and release from physical distancing public health measures [101,102]. However, given uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and necessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be used to avoid appropriate physical distancing or mask wearing.\nSerology testing to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection could be particularly helpful in pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [69]. Recent increases of cases of MIS-C alerted healthcare professionals to the possible link to SARS-CoV-2 infection; indeed, there is high seroprevalence in children presenting with MIS-C, accompanied by neutralizing antibodies to the virus [70., 71., 72.]. In adults, multiple sequelae have been associated with long-term health impacts. Cardiovascular impacts, for instance, are seen in 20–35% of patients, and long-term cardiovascular impacts such as myocarditis have been observed in young adults recovered from COVID-19 [73., 74., 75.]. As this understanding evolves, the use of antibody tests to determine past infection may become more important [76].

You should not interpret the results of your SARS-CoV-2 antibody test as an indication of a specific level of immunity or protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Talk to your health care provider or your state and local health departments if you have questions about whether an antibody test is right for you.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) is reminding the public and health care providers that results from currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should not be used to evaluate a person’s level of immunity or protection from COVID-19 at any time, and especially after the person received a COVID-19 vaccination. While a positive antibody test result can be used to help identify people who may have had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, more research is needed in people who have received a COVID-19 vaccination.\nIf antibody test results are interpreted incorrectly, there is a potential risk that people may take fewer precautions against SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Taking fewer steps to protect against SARS-CoV-2 can increase their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may result in the increased spread of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA is providing additional information and recommendations to the public and health care providers about the use of antibody tests in people who received a COVID-19 vaccination.\nTaking fewer precautions against SARS-CoV-2 exposure can increase their risk of infection and may result in increased spread of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA will continue to monitor the use of authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for purposes other than identifying people with an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 from a recent or prior infection.

Laboratory test results for 126 cases were positive giving a positivity rate of 4.4%. Males accounted for 1,655 (58.4%) while 1,177(41.5%) were female with a variant sex proportion among all sub counties.\n\nInformation 1 provides context about the COVID-19 situation in Kenya, mentioning that measures were implemented to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that the number of cases continued to grow despite these measures. Information 2 contains more specific details about the number of cases in Kenya as of a certain date, with Mombasa having 14 new cases.

Amid a lack of evidence, many clinicians have defaulted to using dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker such as clopidogrel, which is the standard of care for similar coronary artery interventions, researchers said. But they stressed that there is no quality evidence to support use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people with PAD undergoing lower extremity revascularization.\n“People with PAD tend to be undertreated, yet they are at very high risk,” Hiatt said. “I hope that these data will lead to more education and improve how we care for these patients. From these unique data we see the benefit and risks of rivaroxaban plus aspirin were consistent regardless of concomitant use of clopidogrel. However, with higher rates of bleeding when clopidogrel is added to rivaroxaban and aspirin, these findings do not support the routine use of clopidogrel after lower extremity revascularization in these patients if they are on rivaroxaban and aspirin.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-06\nTitle: VOYAGER PAD: Clopidogrel Adds No Benefit to Rivaroxaban+Aspirin\nContent:\nCite this: Mitchel L.

The overall VOYAGER PAD results \"are practice changing for vascular interventions; it was by an order of magnitude the largest vascular intervention trial ever conducted,\" commented Sahil A.\nUse of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in this setting usually aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients who have just undergone lower-extremity revascularization is \"current dogma,\" even though it is not based on any direct evidence for efficacy, but instead came on the scene as \"an extrapolation from the coronary artery literature, where it does have some benefit, particularly after percutaneous coronary intervention,\" he explained.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Rivaroxaban and Aspirin in Peripheral Artery Disease Lower Extremity ...\nContent:\nConclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for acute limb ischemia regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use but with a trend for more International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding with clopidogrel use >30 days than with a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after lower extremity revascularization regardless of concomitant clopidogrel, with a short course (≤30 days) associated with less bleeding.\nBackground: The VOYAGER PAD trial (Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA Along With Rivaroxaban in Endovascular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for Peripheral Artery Disease) demonstrated superiority of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin to reduce major cardiac and ischemic limb events after lower extremity revascularization. Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization. Whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with symptomatic PAD undergoing lower extremity revascularization randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin.\nWith clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding within 365 days (hazard ratio, 3.20 [95% CI, 1.44-7.13]) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (P for trend=0.06).

The VOYAGER-PAD trial found that treatment with aspirin plus rivaroxaban following lower extremity revascularisation in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) leads to a 15% reduction in the risk of major adverse limb and cardiovascular events when compared with aspirin alone.\nOn the principal safety outcome of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding there was no significant difference between the therapies. However, rivaroxaban plus aspirin was associated with a significantly higher incidence for the secondary safety outcome of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding.

Doria resigned the office of mayor in April 2018 to run for Governor of São Paulo.\nJoão Agripino da Costa Doria Júnior was born in São Paulo, the son of an advertising professional and federal deputy João Doria and businesswoman Maria Sylvia Vieira de Moraes Dias. From his paternal family, he is a descendant of the aristocratic Doria family of Genoa, specifically the Costa Doria Family branch, that migrated to Colonial Brazil in 1549, and become one of the richest in Bahia, owing its wealth to the ownership of Engenhos and slaves.\nFollowing the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, Doria's father was ousted from the Chamber of Deputies for supporting leftist president João Goulart. Doria's family had to take refuge in the embassy of Communist Czechoslovakia. Though Doria himself, his brother and mother returned to Brazil two years later, his father had to remain in exile for the next ten years.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 19, 2020, states that São Paulo Governor João Doria announced that the state would not prescribe hydroxychloroquine to patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms if the federal government established the measure.\n\nInformation 2 and 3, with no specific publication dates, mention a Brazilian health care provider that allegedly forced its doctors to prescribe ineffective drugs, including chloroquine, to elderly COVID-19 patients or face job loss.\n\nInformation 4, published on June 15, 2020, clarifies that São Paulo Governor João Doria never claimed to have signed a contract with Sinovac in 2019 regarding a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 5, with a publication date of December 10, 2023, provides a detailed biography of João Doria, including his family background and political career.\n\nBased on the provided information, the CLAIM that João Doria, governor of São Paulo, forbade doctors to give chloroquine to COVID-19 patients is partially true.

However, the claim does not specify whether it refers to all COVID-19 patients or only those with mild symptoms. The claim also does not specify whether Doria forbade doctors to prescribe chloroquine or if he only forbade its use in certain situations.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is generally consistent with Information 1, it lacks sufficient specificity to be classified as entirely true.

For example, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty had stronger associations with AMI in women compared with men, they found. The study was published May 3 in JAMA Network Open. While heart attacks are often associated with older adults, this population-based case-control study examined the relationships among a wide range of AMI-related risk factors involving younger adults.\nThe study found that seven risk factors, many potentially modifiable, collectively accounted for a majority of the total risk of AMI in young women (83.9%) and young men (85.1%). Some of these factors — including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty — have a larger impact on young woman than they do among young men, Lu and her colleagues found. “This study speaks to the importance of specifically studying young women suffering heart attacks, a group that has largely been neglected in many studies and yet is about as large as the number of young women diagnosed with breast cancer,” said Harlan M.\nRaising awareness about the incidence of heart attacks in younger women is a key part of the strategy, she said.

The main inaccurate information is a rumor that the Wuhan pneumonia has now been officially classified as SARI, and that SARI is a superior version of SARS.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* In late January 2020, multiple posts on social media claimed that rinsing one's mouth with saline solution can prevent infection from the new coronavirus.\n* These claims were purportedly made by Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan.\n* However, Zhong Nanshan's team and the World Health Organization have refuted these claims, stating that there is no evidence that saline solution can protect against the new coronavirus.\n* Saline solution can clean the mouth and throat, but it cannot clean the respiratory tract where the new coronavirus invades.\n* Taiwan experts have also debunked the possibility of using saline water to sterilize the mouth, as it might even create a favorable environment for coronaviruses.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that saline solution kills the China coronavirus is false. Experts have refuted the claim and stated that there is no evidence that saline solution can protect against the new coronavirus. The misconception may have arisen due to the fact that saline solution can clean the mouth and throat, but it cannot clean the respiratory tract where the new coronavirus invades. Additionally, saline solution might even create a favorable environment for coronaviruses. Therefore, it is important to rely on accurate information from trusted sources during the ongoing pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.

There are four phase III clinical trials underway in the U.S. for a COVID-19 vaccine, said Spira, with more phase III trials likely to open in the near future. The more vaccines in development, the better, he said.\nBut an effective vaccine hinges on clinical trials that are representative of the broad range of people who will eventually receive it. According to cancer biologist David Tuveson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center in New York and current AACR president-elect, research has revealed that genetic factors could account for some differences in how various ethnic and racial minority populations respond to COVID-19.\nAnna Barker, who moderated the live panel discussion that ended the program, added that not only should underrepresented minorities be recruited to COVID-19 clinical trials, but that once safe and effective vaccines are developed, efforts need to be made to overcome skepticism and mistrust of the health care system by members of these and other communities. Cancer patients have not been included in COVID-19 clinical trials, so it’s not known yet whether having cancer or undergoing treatments would alter the safety or effectiveness of a vaccine.\nCancer patients have not been included in COVID-19 clinical trials, so it’s not known yet whether having cancer or undergoing treatments would alter the safety or effectiveness of a vaccine.

This update in guidance comes as coronavirus cases continue to soar.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-04, explains the effectiveness of face masks in protecting against COVID-19. It states that face masks can help slow the spread of the disease and provides information on different types of masks and their usage.\n\nInformation 3, without a specific publication date, discusses the effectiveness of cloth masks in protecting against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It states that cloth masks may provide some protection if well designed and used correctly.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-01-15, is a Reddit post discussing the CDC's concession that cloth masks do not protect against the coronavirus. The post also discusses the need for better communication from the CDC and the importance of high-grade masks.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-02-10, is a study on the effectiveness of face masks or respirators in indoor public settings. The study found that N95/KN95 respirators and surgical masks offer better protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection than cloth masks.\n\nClaim:\nThe CLAIM, published on 2020-12-02, states that the CDC admitted that cloth face masks do not protect against the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nConsidering the publication dates of the information, the claim was published before any of the other information. However, the claim is partially supported by Information 1, which states that the CDC conceded that cloth masks do not protect against the coronavirus. However, this information was published after the claim, making it difficult to use as evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 3 and 5 support the idea that cloth masks may provide some protection against the coronavirus, but they are generally less effective than medical masks and respirators. Information 2 also supports the idea that face masks can help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is not entirely false, it is misleading. Cloth masks do offer some protection against the coronavirus, but they are generally less effective than other types of masks. The claim would be more accurate if it stated that cloth masks offer less protection against the coronavirus compared to other types of masks.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is not entirely false, it is misleading and does not accurately reflect the current understanding of the effectiveness of cloth masks in protecting against the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim should be classified as partially true but misleading.", "response": "FALSE."}

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020).

Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck.

In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Two rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.\nBoth are variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which physicians in China and Italy also linked to COVID-19 infection, as previously reported by Medscape Medical News. In both cases, physicians made the diagnoses based on abnormal eye examinations. The two patients responded to treatment and improved over 2 weeks, with only the 50-year-old featuring residual symptoms of anosmia and ageusia.

Neurological symptoms are among the larger array of symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) infection, which includes Long COVID. Long COVID affects different people in different ways-- studies have reported up to 200 symptoms associated with Long COVID, and individuals with the condition experience clusters of symptoms.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, discusses the neurological impact of COVID-19 and various conditions linked to the virus. The text explains that the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily due to the body's immune response rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. Additionally, it highlights the increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 for people with neurological disorders.\n\nInformation 2, published by Medscape on April 29, 2020, focuses on two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19: a 50-year-old man who developed Miller Fisher syndrome and a 39-year-old man who developed polyneuritis cranialis. Both are variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The two patients responded to treatment and improved over 2 weeks, with only the 50-year-old having residual symptoms of anosmia and ageusia.\n\nInformation 3, although the publication date is not specified, provides a comprehensive review of the neurological complications of COVID-19. The text discusses common benign neurological complications, severe neuropsychiatric complications like catatonia, and rare neurological complications. It also highlights cerebrovascular complications of the venous system, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).\n\nInformation 4, published by MDedge on April 29, 2020, is identical to Information 2, focusing on the two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, although the publication date is not specified, discusses Long COVID and its neurological symptoms.

SARS-CoV-2 has spread in countries such as Singapore where the climate is humid and temperatures were higher than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Tens of thousands of people have been infected in Singapore, and as of May 8, more than 54,000 were infected in Africa. The coronavirus can spread in hot weather and has also spread in countries such as the UK where temperatures were cooler.\nShare this story: Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Linkedin\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Climate and the spread of COVID-19 | Scientific Reports\nContent:\nTo add evidence from a different perspective, we use global data to examine the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19 controlling for several important confounding factors. To this end, we regress the prevalence of COVID-19 (logarithmically transformed) at the country level against the latitude of a country.\nTo control for key confounders at the country-level, our analysis includes (1) data on air travel16 (to capture a possible way of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across countries but also the remoteness of a place, which might increase the need for air travel); (2) vehicle concentration17 and urbanization16 (to capture differences in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 within a country18); (3) COVID-19 testing intensity19,20 (to control for the vigor of a country’s COVID-19 response and for COVID-19 detection bias in cross-country comparisons21,22); (4) cell phone usage16 (to control for the speed at which information on behavior change for COVID-19 prevention travels within a country18,23); and (5) health expenditure (to capture differences in countries' commitment to population health); old-age dependency ratio (to capture cross-country differences in age structure and family compositions, which can affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2), and income16 (to control for differences in economi\nWHO’s warning that the virus spreads in all climates must still be taken seriously. At the time of revising this manuscript in January 2021, many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by an easier spread of COVID-19 in winter.\nIn sum, we show that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the threat of epidemic resurgence may increase during winter. However, our results do not indicate that the disease will vanish in summer, nor that countries located close to the equator will contain the disease without effective public health measures.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-24\nTitle: Will Heat Kill the COVID-19 Spread This Summer?\nContent:\nCan Coronavirus survive the heat? Could warm weather stop COVID-19 from circulating? Find out if the weather and heat can reduce or possibly end the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-31, is a fact-check by Poynter that debunks the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries. The claim originated from an anonymous letter stating that the virus can be fought off by eating chillies and ginger and can be destroyed at temperatures of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2018-01-25, explains that cold weather does not directly make people sick, and the misconception may come from the fact that people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other when it's cold, which can facilitate the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-11, states that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive and spread in warm climates, citing Singapore and Africa as examples where the virus has spread despite warm temperatures.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a study that examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for several confounding factors. The study found that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-24, discusses whether heat can kill the COVID-19 spread, but it does not provide a definitive answer.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries is false. The virus can survive and spread in warm climates, as evidenced by outbreaks in countries such as Singapore and Africa. Additionally, a study found that an increase in absolute latitude is associated with a higher number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates. Therefore, it is important to take WHO's warning that the virus spreads in all climates seriously and continue to follow public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.", "response": "FALSE."}

FactCheck.org also points out that Trump's claim that Pelosi urged foreign nationals to bring their infections to Chinatown is false.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim that Nancy Pelosi wanted to have a street party or fair in Chinatown, San Francisco, at the end of February is mostly consistent with Information 1, 2, 3, and 5. However, these sources are all reporting on statements made by President Trump, and there is no direct quote or evidence provided that Nancy Pelosi explicitly stated she wanted to have a street party or fair.\n\nConsidering Information 4 from FactCheck.org, it is clear that Nancy Pelosi visited Chinatown on February 24 to support local businesses, not to have a street party or fair. Thus, the claim is mostly false, as it misrepresents Nancy Pelosi's intentions during her visit to Chinatown.", "response": "FALSE."}

It’s Too Late\nContent:\nThen in June, some claimed that it was \"the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19\". In July, 239 scientists signed an open letter appealing to the medical community and governing bodies to recognize the potential risk of airborne transmission. That same month (by coincidence, not as a result of the letter), WHO released a new scientific brief on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that stated:\nOver a year since declaring Covid-19 a pandemic, the World Health Organization has finally admitted that Coronavirus is airborne. Aerosol researchers started warning that \"the world should face the reality\" of airborne transmission in April 2020. Then in June, some claimed that it was \"the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19\".\nMany people think Trump was trying to shift the blame for his poor handling of the pandemic to a scapegoat, criticizing WHO for \"severely mismanaging and covering up\" the spread of Covid-19 and mistakes that \"pushed China's misinformation.\" Others believe that blaming WHO is not scapegoating because there's some merit to Trump's criticism.\nWHO failed to consider that practical advice — to recommend that the public use caution and wear face masks to block airborne droplets — has no major downsides when compared to the alternative, which is to potentially allow people to spread Covid.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-07-09\nTitle: Modes of transmission of virus causing COVID-19: implications for ...\nContent:\nRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7\nAs evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play in transmission.  · Based on the available evidence, including the recent publications mentioned above, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. WHO continues to recommend airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures and support treatment are performed, according to risk assessment.13 These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine14 and those currently used in Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom.15-17\nAt the same time, other countries and organizations, including the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients, and consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3).18-19\nTransmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).  · Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-04-29\nTitle: A guideline to limit indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19\nContent:\nAirborne transmission was also implicated in the COVID-19 outbreak between residents of a Korean high-rise building whose apartments were linked via air ducts (30). Studies have also confirmed the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in respiratory aerosols (31) suspended in air samples collected at distances as large as 16 ft from infected patients in a hospital room (3). Further evidence for the dominance of indoor airborne transmission has come from an analysis of 7,324 early cases outside the Hubei Province, in 320 cities across mainland China (32).\nNext, we illustrate the value of our guideline in contact tracing (82), specifically, in prescribing the scope of the testing of people with whom an infected index case has had close contact. The CDC presently defines a COVID-19 “close contact” as any encounter in which an individual is within 6 ft of an infected person for more than 15 min. Fig. 3 makes clear that this definition may grossly underestimate the number of individuals exposed to a substantial risk of airborne infection in indoor spaces.\nAirborne transmission arises through the inhalation of aerosol droplets exhaled by an infected person and is now thought to be the primary transmission route of COVID-19. By assuming that the respiratory droplets are mixed uniformly through an indoor space, we derive a simple safety guideline for mitigating airborne transmission that would impose an upper bound on the product of the number of occupants and their time spent in a room.\nThe importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-16\nTitle: 10 reasons why the coronavirus is airborne: Study | Mint\nContent:\nThe team highlighted research estimating that silent (asymptomatic or presymptomatic) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission. This silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, \"supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,\" according to the assessment.\nThis silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, \"supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,\" according to the assessment. The researchers also cited work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels; people who were never in each other's presence.\nColorado: According to a new assessment published today in the medical journal Lancet there is consistent, strong evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is predominantly transmitted through the air. Therefore, public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread, according to six experts from the UK, USA and Canada, including Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado Boulder.\nThe team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trish Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-04-21\nTitle: 10 Signs Airborne Coronavirus Spread is What Matters\nContent:\nIn February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It's likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn't know it.\nWith COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease.\nSome children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.\nDoctors and health officials use this term when they don't know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 9, 2021, discusses the World Health Organization (WHO) finally acknowledging the airborne transmission of COVID-19. It mentions that scientists started warning about airborne transmission in April 2020, and by June 2020, some claimed it was the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19.

Lockdowns and school closures had a serious impact on children’s development. Keeping children indoors kept them safe from COVID-19. But it also robbed them of critical experiences that help them develop. As children navigate life beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, parents should watch out for a few possible scenarios:\nIf they are having trouble thinking clearly, they should have an evaluation more focused on neurology. In most cases, children recover from long COVID within a few months. But for some children, it can take a long time to feel better. During this time, it’s important that parents keep an eye on their child’s mental health.\nCountless children in South Asia have lost loved ones and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, the pandemic also presented new challenges for children.\nThirty per cent of children became less physically active during this period, missing out on the health benefits of activities such as cycling, playing football or running around in the park.  · In addition, during the lockdown period over 35% of children spent more time watching television, playing video games or using social media, increasing their sedentary time, thus putting themselves at greater risk of becoming overweight and obese, and increasing their exposure to marketing of unhealthy products via digital media.\nThese data provide invaluable insights into the consequences – both good and bad – of the pandemic and the effects it had on children.

The app was intended to augment traditional contact tracing by automatically tracking encounters between users and later allowing a state or territory health authority to warn a user they have come within 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) with an infected person for 15 minutes or more.\nAdding to the confusion, many news reports used images of Coronavirus Australia in their articles, and the COVIDSafe website linked to the Coronavirus Australia apps for a short time after release. The app launched on 26 April 2020. However, there were early reports that some users had problems with the sign-up. For example, those who entered their phone number during sign-up received the following message: \"Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again.\" Within 24 hours of COVIDSafe's release it had been downloaded by over a million people, and within 48 hours more than two million.\nThese claims are false, as COVIDSafe and ENF are completely incompatible, and ENF is disabled until a compatible app is installed and explicit user consent is given. Even if a third party were to obtain the encounter log of a user, no persons could be identified without also holding the logs of other users the client has encountered. Australia's Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security reported that several of Australia's intelligence and security agencies collected data from COVIDSafe in its first months of operation.\nCOVIDSafe requires an Australia mobile number to register, meaning foreigners in Australia need a local SIM card. Initially, residents of Norfolk Island, an external territory of Australia, were unable to register with the app as they used a different country code to mainland Australia, +672 instead of +61. The Australian government released an update resolving the issue on 18 June 2020.

Many of the projects are part of or aligned with the COVID Human Genetic Effort (COVID HGE), an international consortium of scientists in more than 150 countries who are conducting myriad projects to look for genetic factors for immunity to infection, as well as the absence of symptoms after infection. The consortium has drawn applications from more than 15,000 people, and reports more than 700 enrolled so far.\nThat points to a conundrum facing the studies of genetics and COVID-19: Many confounding factors can contribute to the absence of disease symptoms in people who were significantly exposed. These include their overall health, how much of the virus was shed by COVID-stricken people around them, and the strength of their immune systems.\nIf genetic variations can make people immune or resistant to COVID-19, it remains to be seen how that knowledge can be used to create population-level protection. After all, while the discovery nearly three decades ago that some people have genetic immunity to HIV helped scientists develop post-infection treatments, there is still no vaccine to prevent infection.\nSuch an approach, however, would probably be used only for people at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, such as people with cancer or immune disorders. Sanjana points out that genes exist to serve critical functions, and disabling any of those functions creates risks for unintended harmful consequences. The more likely route, he and other researchers say, is using genetic findings to develop treatments for people after they’re infected, as happened with AIDS. “Genetics can enable us to dichotomize the population into who’s more likely [to develop a severe case of COVID-19] and who’s not,” says Beckmann at ISMMS.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: One Size Doesn’t Fit All: COVID-19 Vaccines and Immunocompromised ...\nContent:\nFor many immunocompromised patients, the regular two-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen—and in some cases, even a third dose—didn't provide sufficient immune protection.

And when people who work out do get sick, they tend to have less severe disease, said David Nieman, a professor of health and exercise science at Appalachian State University, who was not involved in the recent Covid-19 review.\nNow, scientists studying risk factors related to Covid-19 have turned up some preliminary evidence about the link between regular exercise and better immune defenses against disease. When researchers reviewed 16 studies of people who stayed physically active during the pandemic, they found that working out was associated with a lower risk of infection as well as a lower likelihood of severe Covid-19.\nWidespread inflammation can be extremely damaging, even turning your own immune cells against your body. It is a known risk factor for Covid-19, Dr. Nieman said. Therefore, it makes sense that reducing inflammation could improve your chances of fighting off infection, he said. Research also shows that exercise may amplify the benefits of some vaccines. People who worked out right after getting their Covid-19 vaccine, for example, seemed to produce more antibodies.\nThis folk wisdom has been around for ages, but until recently, researchers did not have much data to support the idea. Now, scientists studying risk factors related to Covid-19 have turned up some preliminary evidence about the link between regular exercise and better immune defenses against disease.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-31, states that according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19 if exposed to the virus.

Those in attendance seemed to lose sight of the fact that they were at a funeral and not a political rally, as they cheered Obama on, even giving him a standing ovation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-05, is an article by USA TODAY that debunks the claim about Obama saying that mail-in voting is necessary because in-person gatherings are dangerous. The claim originated from social media posts that included a photo of Obama's eulogy for the late civil rights activist John Lewis. The posts claimed that Obama stated \"rooms packed full of people\" are unsafe and that's why we must 'vote by mail.' The article states that these claims are false, and Obama never said that in-person polls or \"rooms packed full of people\" are unacceptable.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-07-31, is a tweet by a conservative radio host who made a similar claim about Obama's eulogy for John Lewis. The radio host claimed that Obama said \"rooms full of people\" are unsafe and that's why we need mail-in voting, while speaking to a room full of people at the funeral.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-08-17, is an article by The Associated Press that fact-checks the claim about Obama's eulogy for John Lewis. The article states that Obama briefly mentioned mail-in voting during his eulogy, but never referenced \"rooms full of people\" being unsafe as part of an argument for mail-in voting.\n\nInformation 4, publication date not provided, is a video of Obama's eulogy for John Lewis. In the eulogy, Obama advocates for expanded voting rights, including a suggestion of \"adding polling places.\"\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-07-31, is an article that criticizes Obama's eulogy for John Lewis, stating that he exploited the occasion to condemn \"attacks on democracy\" and speak on the myth of voter suppression. The article also mentions that Obama briefly discussed mail-in voting during his eulogy.\n\nClaim Evaluation:\n\nThe claim that Obama told a room full of people that \"rooms full of people\" are dangerous and that's why we must mail-in vote is false. The claim originated from social media posts that misrepresented Obama's eulogy for John Lewis. According to multiple fact-checking articles, Obama briefly mentioned mail-in voting during his eulogy, but never said that in-person gatherings or \"rooms packed full of people\" are unsafe.

Could it be possible that SARS-CoV-2 is the big exception to the rule? To date, there is no strong evidence (i.e., evidence based on causal research) that smokers are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nIn France, researchers first suggested that nicotine may play a role in protecting smokers9, triggering a run on nicotine products among the general public. Interestingly, the lead author of this research has been funded by the tobacco industry in the past, and also other researchers who have made similar claims can be linked with the tobacco industry, indicating a possible conflict of interest. According to the Global Center for Good Governance in Tobacco Control, the tobacco industry was actively involved in downplaying the role of smoking in COVID-19 by spreading claims that smoking or vaping protects against COVID-1910.\nA number of recent studies have found low percentages of smokers among COVID-19 patients, causing scientists to conclude that smokers may be protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm. Conclusions: There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking.\nMaterial and methods: The latest available scientific publications were reviewed until November 14, 2020, from the PubMed platform. Results: Nicotine is a cholinergic agonist and pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibitor. Some authors present that smoking and nicotine reduce the amount of the ACE2 receptors which are used by the novel coronavirus to enter cells, while others claim that ACE2 receptors are upregulated in smokers.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its ...\nContent:\nBackground There is a lot of debate about the effects of <strong>smoking</strong> on COVID-19.

Some studies have found low percentages of smokers among COVID-19 patients, but there is a possibility of conflict of interest as some researchers promoting this idea have ties with the tobacco industry.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the potential role of nicotine in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection. While nicotine has properties that could potentially mitigate the cytokine storm, researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic. The review of scientific publications found conflicting evidence regarding the impact of smoking on ACE2 receptors.\n\nInformation 3 mentions a fixed-effects meta-analysis that found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients. However, other studies have reported an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients.\n\nInformation 4 is a scientific paper published in April 2021 that identified several biases in a study claiming that smokers are less likely to acquire Covid-19, suggesting that smoking is not protective against the virus.\n\nInformation 5 is a study record manager for NCBI and does not contain relevant information to the claim.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that smoking protects against coronavirus is not accurate. The majority of the evidence suggests that smoking is not protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and is, in fact, associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients. The studies suggesting a protective effect of smoking have been found to have biases and conflicts of interest. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

The symptoms and spread of the disease are related to the virus and its effects, not to sarin gas or any gas-related effects.\n\nInformation 2, though the publication date is not specified, is a review on Nature Reviews Microbiology that discusses the emergence, virology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-26, mentions the coronavirus as a serious threat to Iranians injured by chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq War, many of whom suffer from respiratory problems.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2017-05-05, is an article about autopsies on three Syrians who died in an Idlib province attack, which confirmed the use of sarin gas by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-04-02, explains the differences between COVID-19 and SARS, both of which are caused by coronaviruses.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-03-18, states that there is nothing called coronavirus and COVID-19 is caused by sarin gas. This claim is false based on the available information and general knowledge.\n\nFirst, the information provided in Information 1 explicitly contradicts the claim, stating that COVID-19 is not caused by sarin gas. Information 2 further supports this by discussing the emergence, virology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nSecond, the claim is inconsistent with general knowledge about coronaviruses and sarin gas. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as COVID-19. Sarin gas is a nerve agent, a type of chemical weapon that can cause death within minutes if inhaled or ingested in high doses.\n\nLastly, Information 3, 4, and 5 further support the distinction between coronaviruses and sarin gas, as they discuss the coronavirus as a separate entity from chemical weapons or gas-related effects.", "response": "FALSE."}

During physical activity that was strenuous enough to increase heart rates by approximately 30 bpm, there were again no significant changes in gas exchange when wearing either type of facemask.\nFirst, our sample size is modest, though notably larger than many prior studies assessing gas exchange while wearing masks. Second, the duration of each study phase was 10 minutes, which was chosen to provide adequate time to observe physiologic changes but not require people to volunteer more than 90 minutes of their time. Though the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.\nThough the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.

Even though the Chinese government discredited the possibility of a lab origin based on genetic studies, the distance of the epicenter from the bat caves raises questions. Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4). Naturally, the origins of the epidemic were investigated. All the studies of Shi Zhengli, the lead virologist from the institute, on bat related coronaviruses were centered in the southern, subtropical areas of Yunnan. However, the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, which is almost 900 km from Yunnan. This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nUp to 96% similarity was found between SARS-COV-2 and the bat coronavirus using whole-genome analysis [7]. This theory was supported by other studies that have been summarized in detail elsewhere [8, 9]. A study supported this suggestive finding by using sequence-based analysis and artificial intelligence on the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus [10]. Snakes were found to be the most probable wildlife repository for the virus compared with other animals [11]. Conversely, another study suggested that SARS-COV-2 could have originated from bats but with pangolins as the possible intermediate hosts [12].\nIn conclusion, all these specific features observed in SARS-COV-2 helps scientists to rule out the idea that this pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is the result of a man-made action that could be either engineered in the laboratory or further created as a bioweapon out of conspiracy.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-06-14\nTitle: Nature-based or lab leak?

This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.\nNarrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has.

On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Although there are also studies that reported to have no benefit for using chloroquine on COVID-19 patients and documented increased risk of cardiotoxicity [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Notably, chloroquine is an ionophore for zinc and could increase the cellular entry of zinc [46]. Additionally, intracellular antiviral effects of zinc might be partly related to the chloroquine-induced beneficial effects documented in COVID-19 patients. In a recent clinical observation, zinc sulfate, in combination with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, has shown to provide better therapeutic benefits to the COVID-19 infected patients than the patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, without zinc; an increased frequency of hospital discharge and reduced mortality are documented in zinc sulfate added-COVID-19 patients [47]. \nThe zinc-binding sites were shown to be conserved in RdRp and 3CLpro by molecular modeling [20]. Though exact mechanisms are not yet defined, zinc-binding can reduce the enzymatic activities of 3CLpro and RdRp to inhibit viral replication [19]. In vitro studies have claimed that low zinc levels favor viral multiplication in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells [21]. Similarly, zinc could markedly inhibit the replication potential of the respiratory syncytial virus [22]. Investigators had shown an 800-fold reduction in the respiratory syncytial virus when 10 μM concentration of zinc was present during preincubation, adsorption, penetration, and egress [22]. In the clinical scenario, zinc supplementation resulted in a marked reduction in pneumonia prevalence in children [23], [24]. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication has also been suppressed by zinc [25], and zinc supplementation has enhanced the response of antiviral therapy for HCV-induced hepatitis patients [26], [27], [28].

If you need to be outside during curfew hours, you will be expected to carry a “self-declaration curfew\" form.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by The New York Times on November 21, 2020, discusses how cities, states, and counties in the United States have imposed curfews to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The effectiveness of curfews in stopping the spread of the virus is unclear.\n\nInformation 2, published by Reuters on March 22, 2020, reports that India launched a 14-hour curfew on March 22 to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, published by an unknown source on March 21, 2020, is a fact-check that debunks the claim that a 14-hour curfew will break the cycle of infection of the coronavirus. The fact-check explains that the virus can persist on surfaces for two or three days, and a social lockdown is an effective strategy for reducing new infections.\n\nInformation 4, published by Reuters on May 28, 2020, reports that Kuwait will replace its full-time curfew with a 12-hour curfew during nighttime hours.\n\nInformation 5, published without a date, provides information about the coronavirus curfew in the Netherlands. The curfew will be in effect from 9 pm on January 23 until (at least) 4.30 am on April 20. Members of the public are expected to stay at home during these hours, with some exceptions for essential workers.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim that coronavirus will be cured after a 14-hour curfew is false. Information 3, published on the same day as the claim, debunks the idea that a 14-hour curfew can break the cycle of infection of the coronavirus. The fact-check explains that the virus can persist on surfaces for two or three days, and a social lockdown is an effective strategy for reducing new infections. The claim is not supported by any scientific evidence or medical research.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is inconsistent with the information provided in Information 1, which states that the effectiveness of curfews in stopping the spread of the virus is unclear. The information provided in Information 4 and 5 also contradicts the claim, as both Kuwait and the Netherlands have implemented curfews that are shorter than 14 hours.\n\nIn summary, the claim that coronavirus will be cured after a 14-hour curfew is false and not supported by any scientific evidence or medical research. The claim is inconsistent with information provided by reputable sources, including The New York Times, Reuters, and the Dutch government.", "response": "FALSE."}

Made of soft silicone, the masks are comfortable to wear, according to health care worker surveys, and they have a shelf life of a decade or more. “It’s frustrating and frightening because a mask like this can make the difference between life and death, but no one knows about them,” said Claudio Dente, whose company, Dentec Safety, recently stopped making elastomeric respirators that were specifically redesigned at the request of federal regulators for health care workers.\nTheir recommendation, elastomeric respirators, an industrial-grade face mask familiar to car painters and construction workers, would in the decades that followed become the gold standard for infection-control specialists focused on the dangers of airborne pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promoted them during the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the swine flu pandemic of 2009. A few studies since then have suggested that reusable elastomeric respirators should be essential gear for frontline medical workers during a respiratory pandemic, which experts predicted would quickly deplete supplies of N95s, the disposable filtration masks largely made in China.\nAccording to a paper he published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, none of the employees went back to wearing N95s. The cost benefit of relying almost entirely on elastomerics became irrefutable: Outfitting the workers was one-tenth as expensive than supplying them with disposable N95s.\nThree years into the pandemic, elastomeric respirators — industrial-grade face masks familiar to car painters and construction workers — remain a rarity at U.S. health care facilities.Credit...Kirsten Luce for The New York Times ...

News of the death came shortly after Spain’s Health Ministry announced on its Twitter page that several sporting events would be held behind closed doors, while medical conferences will be cancelled in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.\nSuch events include the return leg of the Champions League match between Valencia and Italy’s Atalanta scheduled for March 10, and a Europa League match between Getafe and Inter Milan on March 19.

In their publication, Huang et al reported the first recognized lung ultrasound features, which follow a peculiar pattern along the chest in an upper anterior‐to‐lower posterior crescendo distribution.\nWe propose 11 lung ultrasound roles for different medical settings during the pandemic, starting from the out‐of‐hospital setting, where lung ultrasound has ergonomic and infection control advantages. Then we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID‐19 care pathways. Finally, we present outpatient use of lung ultrasound to aid follow‐up of positive case contacts and of those discharged from the hospital.\nThe current application of lung ultrasound into triage flowcharts is limited by the lack of standard scanning protocols and operator experience, which may influence the validity and interpretation of test results. Although prospective studies have not yet validated lung ultrasound‐based triage, this concept paves the way for further research efforts aimed at preventing an overwhelmed healthcare system during a possible second wave of a viral pandemic.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 discuss the first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection. The protocol was developed by a team of Italian experts with experience using the technology on the front line. However, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients. The National Health Service in England does not even mention lung ultrasound in its radiology decision tool for suspected COVID-19, specifying instead chest X-ray as the first-line diagnostic imaging tool, with CT scanning in equivocal cases. The Italian team suggests that wireless probes and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment in the setting of COVID-19, as they can easily be wrapped in single-use plastic covers, reducing the risk of contamination, and making sterilization easy. However, some experts, such as Volpicelli, do not like the undue focus on wireless devices for lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThe claim states that the first protocol on how to use lung ultrasound to triage COVID-19 has been published. This claim is consistent with the information provided, as information 1, 2, 3, and 4 discuss the publication of the first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the claim is true.", "response": "TRUE."}

The Link Between Distinct Conspiracy Beliefs ...\nContent:\nAlthough this general pattern seems to be one of the most robust findings in the psychology of conspiracy theories, in the current COVID-19 situation, two popular conspiracy theories did not only seem to be logically incompatible but might be related to different behaviors as well. While many people played down the danger of COVID-19, calling it no worse than a flu, and suspected others to purposefully claim otherwise for their own advantage (e.g., hurting national economies, passing unpopular/restricting laws), others painted an even more drastic picture by claiming that the new coronavirus had not evolved by mutation (Andersen et al., 2020) but had been intentionally manufactured and purposefully spread as a bioweapon for political or economic gains.\nTo tap into the idea that it is a harmless virus that receives overblown attention for personal benefit of a few people (COVID-19 hoax), we asked participants for their agreement with the following statements: “The virus is intentionally presented as dangerous in order to mislead the public,” “Experts intentionally mislead us for their own benefit, even though the virus is not worse than a flu,” and “We should believe experts when they say that the virus is dangerous” (reverse-coded).\nThus, even claiming that COVID-19 was not worse than a common flu was associated with self-reports of behavior characterized as overreacting (e.g., hoarding), but SARS-CoV-2 human-made still had a substantial effect, f2 = .068. Exploratory analyses show that these associations are generally stronger, the more threatened people felt by the virus (see the Supplemental Material).\nIntriguingly, these strong reactions were independently related also to the endorsement that COVID-19 is no worse than a flu, particularly for those who feel strongly threatened by it.

Unfortunately, much of it has failed to be appropriately skeptical about the claims of AI’s value. Like many tools, AI has a role to play, but its effect on the outbreak is probably small.\nStill, various news articles have dramatized the role AI is playing in the pandemic by overstating what tasks it can perform, inflating its effectiveness and scale, neglecting the level of human involvement, and being careless in consideration of related risks. In fact, the COVID-19 AI-hype has been diverse enough to cover the greatest hits of exaggerated claims around AI.\nIn evaluating CT scans, a model that can differentiate between healthy people and those with COVID-19 might start to fail when it encounters patients who are sick with the regular flu (and it is still flu season in the United States, after all). A drop of 10% accuracy or more during deployment would not be unusual.\nAlternatively, a comprehensive computational simulation can be used to train the model, as is the case for Go and chess. Without one of these two approaches, AI cannot do much of anything. This explains why AI alone can’t predict the spread of new pandemics: There is no database of prior COVID-19 outbreaks (as there is for the flu).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, discusses two popular conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19. One theory claims that the virus is no worse than the flu and that experts are exaggerating its danger for personal gain. The other theory claims that the virus is a bioweapon intentionally manufactured and spread for political or economic gains. The study mentioned in this information found that people who believe the virus is no worse than the flu are more likely to engage in overreaction behaviors, such as hoarding.\n\nInformation 2, also published without a specific date, states that President Trump has lied about the severity of COVID-19, claiming it is no worse than the flu. However, Trump admitted to journalist Bob Woodward that he knew the virus was more deadly than the flu and intentionally downplayed its severity.\n\nInformation 3, published on October 7, 2020, supports Information 2, stating that Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity of COVID-19, comparing it to the flu. Experts have expressed concern that this dismissal of the virus encourages the public to not take necessary precautions.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 23, 2022, states that even now, COVID-19 is killing three times as many people as the flu.\n\nInformation 5, published on April 2, 2020, discusses the role of artificial intelligence in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

The photographs show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker addressing a large crowd without wearing face masks. Information 1 and 2 clarify that the photos were taken before the CDC recommended wearing masks and before Michigan announced its first presumptive positive coronavirus case.

The photographs were taken at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9, weeks before face masks and other social distancing guidelines were first implemented in the United States. Therefore, the claim is misleading as it implies that the photograph was taken recently, during a time when wearing masks and social distancing are required.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on August 20, 2020, while the photographs were taken on March 9, 2020, as confirmed by multiple sources.

The most famous example of pandemics in the pre-modern period was the plague, which repeatedly struck most of Europe and the Near East in successive waves across the centuries.\nIslamic ethical discussions on the themes of plagues and pandemics grew out of commentaries on specific references in the foundational sources: the Qurʾān and Prophetic reports. These references center around a number of moral questions such as: justification for these incidents; relationship between these events and divine destiny as well as the proper view and attitude of a believer towards these events; scope of human intervention and the extent to which such intervention is obligatory; impact of these incidents on ritual deeds; and finally impact of these incidents on social interpersonal interactions.\nHistorical accounts of the various epidemics and plague pandemics that struck different regions at different times show how Islamic normative discussions on topics such as contagion, illness, and medical treatment shaped the attitudes of Muslims during these times. One of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\nOne of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.

This article examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the global pandemic during its early months and provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives.\nDuring data collection, the authors identified six newly established pro-Islamic State groups and channels with coronavirus or pandemic names and themes, in both English and Arabic. Examples include the now defunct Telegram channels “The Pandemic,” “korounna,” and “COVID-19,” among others. Naming groups could be undertaken for various reasons to include: supporters exploiting a timely subject, supporters creating groups and channels dedicated to coronavirus news and discussion, or supporters evading pro-Islamic State group and channel shutdowns through the use of non-Islamic State-themed names.25 When considering the content within these groups and channels, the most plausible reasons are utilizing the newsworthy and global nature of the virus, along with a desire to discuss COVID-19 in environments of shared belief.\nIn turn, 11 dominant themes and narratives were identified, highlighting the ways in which decentralized online pro-Islamic State networks create content designed to appeal to a diverse audience, capitalize on a current event, as well as provide a space for community engagement and camaraderie in a time of social isolation. Although the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic brought much of the world to a stand-still, the internet has allowed people to remain virtually connected and updated on the latest COVID-19-related news, including violent extremist groups and terrorist organizations.\nIt is important to note that the framing of this category is not meant to infer that religion does not have bearing on other themes and narratives in the dataset, including the divine punishment and vindictive categories. Islamic State Coronavirus News: content that denotes the sharing of Islamic State news on the coronavirus. Socioeconomic Decay: content includes discussions on what life will look like after the pandemic: social unrest, economic devastation, and the collapse of society.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-14, discusses a specific instance of misinformation spreading on social media related to the coronavirus pandemic. This includes a video of a choir from Bosnia and Herzegovina that was falsely claimed to be a recording of musicians from various religious backgrounds reciting the 99 names of God in Islam during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. Additionally, a photo of an Egyptian doctor was shared with a false claim that he had invented a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the targeting of Muslims on social media during the coronavirus pandemic. It highlights the spread of conspiracy theories, memes, fake posts, and hateful rhetoric against Muslims.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not provided, discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on religious practices in the Muslim world. It highlights how the pandemic has influenced religious practices with respect to health protection.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-04-13, discusses Islamic ethical discussions on the themes of plagues and pandemics. It highlights how these discussions have shaped the attitudes of Muslims during past pandemics and how they promote a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-29, examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives in pro-Islamic State media related to the pandemic.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a wave of Islamic-themed myths on social media.\n\nJudgement:\nThe claim is TRUE based on the available information. Information 1 and 2 both discuss instances of misinformation spreading on social media related to the coronavirus pandemic and the Muslim community. Information 5 also highlights how pro-Islamic State media have used the pandemic as a theme in their content, further supporting the claim.

But even as Italians stayed inside, officials in the country’s north, the front line of the outbreak, pleaded for still stronger measures that would essentially shut down all commercial activity and public transportation in an effort to suffocate the contagion.\nSome older Italians said the streets had a wartime feel.

These are often driven by the pre-existing obsessions of the various conspiracy groups: while some continue to focus centrally on the supposed ill health effects of 5G radiation itself (even to the point of denying that there is a coronavirus at all, and claiming that COVID-19 is merely a cover story to explain the effects of the 5G tests in Wuhan), others now position 5G as part of a much larger and more complex agenda that involves bioengineered viruses and deadly, 5G-activated vaccines.\nIt remains unclear at this stage whether this claim is related directly to early reports about the COVID-19 outbreak or represents a more general, pre-existing fear. (The term COVID-19 itself was introduced by the WHO only on 11 February 2020, and these early posts are therefore necessarily somewhat vague about their subject; cf. WHO, 2020.) Some such posts explicitly re-share much older Facebook posts that anticipate that the active extermination phase will be triggered by a ‘pandemic virus’, however, and this act of re-sharing can be interpreted as making a deliberate link between such pre-existing conspiracy theories and the present outbreak.\nThe 5G connection is not the only COVID-19-related conspiracy, of course (one of the more prominent theories, for example, claims that the virus was developed in a laboratory in Wuhan, from where it was accidentally or intentionally released). Such theories circulate perhaps because people have been seeking some more tangible (rather than literally invisible) causes for such massive social and economic disruptions.1\nDuring the first weeks of January, very few Facebook posts match our selection criteria; indeed, even those that do relate only very loosely, if at all, to the COVID-19 outbreak. Rather, these posts repeat typical conspiracist tropes about secret plans to exterminate the majority of the world’s population through a combination of water fluoridation, mass vaccination, chemtrails, genetically modified foods and ‘toxic’ 5G emissions (that is, they are mostly a continuation of the extant anti-science/technology rhetoric).

The novel coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2), the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that probably originated in a seafood market in Wuhan in December 2019 [4,5].

Three months later, conspiracy theorists making similar claims were setting cellphone towers on fire in Europe.

While many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors.\nIndeed, even the core concerns about electromagnetic sensitivity are not unique to mobile telecommunications. Anti-windfarm activists have also made similar erroneous claims about links between windfarms and electromagnetic sensitivity, and EMF exposure (McCallum et al., 2014). There are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19.\nThere are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer. Indeed, this line of thinking was already present in anti-5G circles and it was merely amplified when the pandemic emerged as a new risk vector, one that directly challenged people’s immune system (Asher Hamilton, 2020a).\nThe idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer. Indeed, this line of thinking was already present in anti-5G circles and it was merely amplified when the pandemic emerged as a new risk vector, one that directly challenged people’s immune system (Asher Hamilton, 2020a). The second and more prominent conspiracy moves well away from these historical concerns with EMF exposure. Instead, it argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The conspiracy of Covid-19 and 5G: Spatial analysis fallacies in ...\nContent:\nThroughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data.\nOthers have argued that 5G was first tested in Wuhan, China, the city linked to the first cases of COVID-19, which proves it is the cause of the virus. Still others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020).\nStill others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020). In all iterations, 5G is depicted as either “Satan's strategy” to advance the apocalypse, or the work of a techno-capitalist government cabal that seeks to reduce the population, profit from a vaccine, or embed micro-chips into the vaccine for the purposes of surveillance or control (Wu, 2020).\nKeywords: Conspiracy theories, Spatial data, Health geography, Public data, COVID-19, 5G · When COVID-19 reached European and American cities, alternative knowledge claims quickly emerged confronting official accounts of the cause of the virus. Rather than spawning new conspiracy theories, COVID-19 has led to improvisations on many older ones, in this case linking it to mobile electromagnetic frequencies, using many of the same logical and methodological fallacies to “prove” their veracity (Sturm and Albrecht, 2021).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published likely in 2020, discusses the emergence of COVID-19/5G conspiracy theories on Facebook. The theories claim that 5G technology is causing the illness, and some even deny the existence of the coronavirus. These theories circulated as early as January 2020, and were shared by users on Facebook, often linking to pre-existing conspiracy theories about extermination plans involving 5G emissions.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, presents an analysis of the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter. The study found that there was a lack of an authority figure actively combating such misinformation, and that policymakers should isolate opinions based on fake news to avoid public health damage.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 24, 2020, explains the conspiracy theory about 5G causing the coronavirus pandemic. The theory originated from a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés in January 2020 and spread rapidly on the internet. Despite fact-checking efforts, conspiracy theorists have continued to connect 5G technology with the pandemic and set cellphone towers on fire in Europe.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, discusses the two types of conspiracy theories associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers the immune system, making people more susceptible to the virus. The second conspiracy theory argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not specified, outlines how spatial data has been co-opted by conspiracy theorists to assert a correlation between 5G and COVID-19. These theories are not fringe phenomena and are often distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the installation of 5G towers.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that the COVID-19 pandemic was fake and that 5G telecommunications is causing the illness.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nBased on the provided information, the claim is false. The COVID-19 pandemic is a real and serious public health crisis, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that 5G technology causes the illness. In fact, the information suggests that conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to the pandemic have been circulating on social media since early 2020, despite fact-checking efforts to debunk these claims. These theories have led to harmful consequences, such as the destruction of cellphone towers in Europe. Therefore, it is important to rely on credible sources of information and to avoid spreading misinformation about the pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

Trump, however, has repeatedly denied that the rise in cases reflects increased transmission of the virus, and has instead insisted that increased testing is the cause. The president began pinning the blame on testing as early as June 15, when in a tweet he said that because U.S. testing “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country … it shows more cases.” He called testing a “double edged sword” because it is “good to” have, but “[m]akes us look bad.”\nLater in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths. “Cases up only because of our big number testing,” he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. “Mortality rate way down!!!” · The same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, discusses the increasing coronavirus death toll in the United States, which was about 80,000 at the time.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.
