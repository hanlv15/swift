FULL CLAIM: “no one has died from the coronavirus”; “no novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies have been found”; “the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates”; “the inability to identify monoclonal antibodies for the virus suggests there is no basis for the vaccines”; “the WHO is creating [worldwide] chaos is by prohibiting almost all autopsies of people deemed to have died from COVID-19”\nMonoclonal antibodies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 are available and pathologists use a variety of techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in published studies. “the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates” · Koch’s postulates are a set of criteria used to determine whether a certain microorganism is the cause of a disease. They were originally developed by Robert Koch, a German physician who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1905 for his work on tuberculosis. The original postulates are as follows:\nIn summary, the article’s claim is false. Monoclonal antibodies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 are available and pathologists use a variety of techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in published studies. “the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates”\nThere are many studies on SARS-CoV-2 that fulfill Koch’s postulates[14-16]. European Society of Pathology: [The following statement was co-signed by ESP President Prof. Holger Moch, ESP Director-General Dr. Raed Al-Dieri, and ESP Secretary Prof. Aurelio Ariza] In response to some of the claims made by the article “No one has died from the coronavirus,” the European Society of Pathology (ESP) offers the following comments:\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-03-04\nTitle: Fact Check-Koch’s postulates do not need to be fulfilled to prove ...\nContent:\nHowever, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here). In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals. This makes it impossible to fulfil this postulate, and by extension, the fourth postulate, in diseases specific to humans (here). Postulate Four: “The microorganism can be transferred from the infected and diseased individuals back into a pure culture.” While not an original postulate of Koch’s (here), this is essentially a repeat of step two using a different source.\nAn article that claims that researchers have not proven that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 uses outdated criteria and presents incomplete facts to make its arguments. The article focuses on how researchers have not fulfilled Koch’s postulates - a 19th-century set of criteria to show a microbe causes a disease - as they were originally understood.\nUpdated criteria for determining viruses that cause disease are sometimes still referred to as Koch’s postulates (here) These involve animals being infected with the suspect virus (here and here) and viruses being grown in cells (here), which would not be considered a “pure culture” as Koch would have understood it (here) and would not fulfil the purification criteria mentioned previously even though other microbes are removed (here). VERDICT False. Koch’s postulates, as they were originally understood, do not need to be demonstrated in order to establish that a microbe causes a disease. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and has been shown to do so by modern standards, including criteria modelled on Koch’s postulates, as well as genetic techniques that were not developed until decades after Koch’s death.\nWhile purposeful infection of humans with disease has been done historically, this is rare due to ethical concerns. However, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here). In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Koch's postulates fulfilled for SARS virus - PMC\nContent:\nThese permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. ...

SARS–CoV–infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re–isolated from these animals and they developed SARS–CoV–specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS–CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS.\nSARS–CoV–infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re–isolated from these animals and they developed SARS–CoV–specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS–CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS. Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS–CoV were also developed. These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS–CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-06, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that no one has died from the coronavirus, no antibodies have been found that identify SARS-CoV-2, pathologists have no means of verifying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 has not fulfilled Koch's postulates. The fact-check mentions that monoclonal antibodies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered and used by pathologists to detect the virus in human tissue.

These articles demonstrate that the SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV) is the etiological agent of SARS, providing evidence from experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that no one has died from the coronavirus, there are no antibodies that identify SARS-CoV-2, pathologists have no means of verifying whether a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 has not fulfilled Koch's postulates is false.

Disclosure: Anna Sayburn has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. For decades, we've been promised that telemedicine will save primary care money and time. Yet somehow, for most NHS GP services, face-to-face consultations have remained standard operating procedure. Why go to the hassle of introducing video consultations, when everyone can pop down to the surgery? The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly changed all that.\nProfessor Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, has produced a guide on introducing video consultation for practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. She agrees that infrastructure is a problem: \"Some of them [GPs] are making it work and some are really struggling because they haven't got the infrastructure. Infrastructure issues are going to be mission critical.\" The move to online working has exposed weaknesses in the technology available to primary care, says Dr Jameel.\nBut do remote consultations work as well as face-to-face visits, even when the technology is in place?

One of the more comprehensive looks at this topic was a systematic review of telemedicine practice in primary care before the pandemic, including 81 studies conducted both domestically and abroad.30 The results from this study have been supplemented by other publications conducted during the pandemic, and general conclusions about patient outcomes for different categories of careare summarized below.\nThe typical model for direct-to-consumer telemedicine is a single encounter between a clinician and patient who have no preceding relationship, and the clinician is often limited by lack of on-site testing, no means to bring patient in for a face-to-face examination, and little way to ensure the patient will access follow-up care if they get worse. Telemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.\nTelemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.

The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade. To be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.

Broadly, it allows the federal government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n2 event in Wilmington, Del., Biden said, \"When it got up to March, I kept saying, look, you’ve got to invoke, and you remember, I think I was the first — I may be mistaken — person calling about the Defense Production Act. … Use that authority. Use it to go out there now and don’t wait to talk about the need for us to have masks.\" Biden said he may be mistaken, and he is. But Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which our friends at FactCheck.org rated skeptically. Since he has continued to say it, we will put it on the Truth-O-Meter.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-12-29\nTitle: Defense Production Act of 1950 - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe order gave USDA extraordinary powers to have firms maintain production. The order does not allow companies to ignore safety rules (except for keeping the plants opened), however, and OSHA / CDC guidance remains in force. In September 2020, OSHA fined Smithfield and JBS for failing to take the necessary actions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. On December 8, 2020, more than a month after losing the 2020 presidential election, then-president Trump said that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce vaccine doses, but he did not do so before the end of his term.\nIn January, 2021, President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act on his second day in office to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic, such as protective equipment. On March 2, Biden invoked the DPA again to supply equipment to Merck facilities needed to safely manufacture Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nIn March 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States, which includes lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese used by large-capacity batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles.\nOn June 6, 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate domestic production of green energy technology. The administration responded to growing energy costs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The invocation came along with a 2-year tariff exemption that ends in June 2024 on solar panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nThe Defense Production Act of 1950 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 81–774) is a United States federal law enacted on September 8, 1950, in response to the start of the Korean War. It was part of a broad civil defense and war mobilization effort in the context of the Cold War.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-01\nTitle: Defense Production Act Has Been Used Routinely, but Not With ...\nContent:\nBuilding an aircraft carrier or a frigate using priority ratings or saving a hundred thousand lives using priorities for ventilators?” said Larry Hall, who retired in August as the director of the Defense Production Act program division at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “If we used the president’s logic, most of our economy is already nationalized. But it isn’t.” · On Friday, the president said he had finally pressed the law into action to force General Motors to step up efforts to manufacture ventilators. Then the federal authorities raided the home of a hoarder in Brooklyn and his warehouse in New Jersey, invoking the Defense Production Act to recoup tens of thousands of surgical masks.\nInvoking the Defense Production Act is hardly a rare occurrence. As recently as last summer, the Department of Defense used it to obtain rare earth metals needed to build lasers, jet engines and armored vehicles.\nYet as governors and members of Congress plead with the president to use the law to force the production of ventilators and other medical equipment to combat the coronavirus pandemic, he has for weeks treated it like a “break the glass” last resort, to be invoked only when all else fails. “You know, we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month. “Call a person over in Venezuela, ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well.” · The Defense Production Act includes a range of authorities including issuing loans to expand a vendor’s capacity, controlling the distribution of a company’s products and the more commonly used power of compelling companies to prioritize the government’s order over those of other clients.\nWith General Motors, it is unclear what the act accomplished. The company had already announced its intention to collaborate with the medical device firm Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators. After the president threatened on Friday to invoke the Defense Production Act against G.M., the automaker announced that the venture would aim to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The Defense Production Act (DPA) is a federal law that allows the US government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency. It was signed by President Harry Truman in 1950 and amended periodically since then.\n* In March 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden claimed that he was the first person to call for invoking the DPA to boost manufacturing of high-demand health products, such as protective equipment.\n* Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which fact-checkers rated skeptically.\n* Biden was not the first official to call for use of the DPA to boost manufacturing of urgently needed medical supplies.\n* On January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden invoked the DPA on his second day in office to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic, such as protective equipment.\n* On March 2, 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA again to supply equipment to Merck facilities needed to safely manufacture Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n* In March 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States.\n* On June 6, 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA to accelerate domestic production of green energy technology.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim made by Joe Biden that he was the first person to call for invoking the DPA is false. Biden made this claim in September 2020, but fact-checkers had already rated similar remarks he made in mid to late March as skeptical. Additionally, Biden was not the first official to call for use of the DPA to boost manufacturing of urgently needed medical supplies. President Biden invoked the DPA on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022 to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic and to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States. Therefore, the claim made by Joe Biden is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ...

It is useful to first visualize what different stable matchings look like (refer to the graphs on the right). Consider two different stable matchings, A and B.\nThe rural hospitals theorem answers this question negatively assuming all preferences are strict (i.e., no doctor is indifferent between two hospitals and no hospital is indifferent between two doctors). The theorem has two parts:\nThe rural hospitals theorem (RHT) is a fundamental theorem in the theory of stable matching. It considers the problem of matching doctors to hospitals for residency, where each doctor is matched to a single hospital but each hospital has several positions for doctors.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Why Health Care Is Harder to Access in Rural America | U.S. GAO\nContent:\nMore than 60 million Americans—about one-fifth of the U.S. population—live in rural areas. On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents. But while they may require more medical attention and care, they also might have more limited access to health care.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 2, 2020, is an article discussing the challenges faced by rural hospitals in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic. These hospitals serve older, poorer, and sicker populations with fewer resources, including ICU beds, staffing options, and access to specialists.

But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent.

It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February. New coronavirus booster: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone 6 months or older get an updated coronavirus shot, but the vaccine rollout has seen some hiccups, especially for children.\nNo one thinks that anywhere near half the state’s population had covid-19 at that time, so those results would imply that testing was overly focused on a subset of the population highly likely to be infected. Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization.

While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased.

This represented only one step in the conventional methods for “isolation and characterization of pathogenic viruses.” With the alleged coronavirus pandemic, Lanka again commisioned experiments to be undertaken by an independent German laboratory, but this time the intention is for control experiments to be performed paralleling all of seven procedures used by virologists in the characterization of the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nPodbielski’s construct of making scientific evidence out of six unproven facts, which the Regional Court of Ravensburg followed, was rejected by the Court of Appeal with detailed reasons in paragraphs 82, 85 and 86 of the written judgement.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17].

These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

Even though the Chinese government discredited the possibility of a lab origin based on genetic studies, the distance of the epicenter from the bat caves raises questions. Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4). Naturally, the origins of the epidemic were investigated. All the studies of Shi Zhengli, the lead virologist from the institute, on bat related coronaviruses were centered in the southern, subtropical areas of Yunnan. However, the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, which is almost 900 km from Yunnan. This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nUp to 96% similarity was found between SARS-COV-2 and the bat coronavirus using whole-genome analysis [7]. This theory was supported by other studies that have been summarized in detail elsewhere [8, 9]. A study supported this suggestive finding by using sequence-based analysis and artificial intelligence on the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus [10]. Snakes were found to be the most probable wildlife repository for the virus compared with other animals [11]. Conversely, another study suggested that SARS-COV-2 could have originated from bats but with pangolins as the possible intermediate hosts [12].\nIn conclusion, all these specific features observed in SARS-COV-2 helps scientists to rule out the idea that this pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is the result of a man-made action that could be either engineered in the laboratory or further created as a bioweapon out of conspiracy.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-06-14\nTitle: Nature-based or lab leak?

Narrator: So what if they went with the other option and mutated an existing virus? This is known as serial passage and acts in a similar way to selective breeding. Scientists are able to mimic evolution, to a degree. By forcing the virus to mutate over and over again into a potentially different form. This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.\nNarrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has. So creating a new, deadly backbone is pretty much impossible. But there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\nBut there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.

It mentions genetic studies that found up to 96% similarity between SARS-COV-2 and bat coronaviruses, and also suggests that pangolins could be possible intermediate hosts. However, the information concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 14, 2021, reports on satellite images showing increased auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present before the outbreak was reported to the world.\n\nInformation 3, published on June 12, 2020, explains that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 was manmade or laboratory-created.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]]. The nucleic acid vaccine is considered as safer alternative than that of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines which are used currently to acquire immunity against dengue, malaria, typhoid and anthrax etc [25,71].

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers were able to come up with vaccines for this new virus much faster because of work that was already happening. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews and evaluates COVID-19 vaccines for quality, safety, and effectiveness. The FDA then issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain vaccines that meet rigorous, science-based standards. The FDA determines that these vaccines are safe and effective for public use.\nDecember 18, 2020 FDA issued the second EUA for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 18 years and older for the prevention of COVID-19.

It can help: ... Cortisol is also needed for the ‘fight or flight’ response, which is your healthy, natural response to perceived threats. The amount of cortisol produced is controlled by your body to ensure the balance is correct.\nCortisol production by your adrenal glands is regulated by your pituitary gland. This is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain that is sometimes referred to as the ‘master gland’ because of its wide effects on your body.\nIt sends a signal to your adrenal glands to produce the right amount of cortisol. Usually, your body produces the right amount of cortisol to keep you healthy. If you have a condition such as Cushing’s syndrome, your body produces too much cortisol. If you have a condition such as Addison’s disease, your body produces too little cortisol.\nWhen you are stressed, increased cortisol is released into your bloodstream.

Cortisol affects several aspects of your body and mainly helps regulate your body's response to stress.\nRegulating your body’s stress response: During times of stress, your body can release cortisol after releasing its “fight or flight” hormones, such as adrenaline, so you continue to stay on high alert. In addition, cortisol triggers the release of glucose (sugar) from your liver for fast energy during times of stress.\nHelping control your sleep-wake cycle: Under regular circumstances, you have lower cortisol levels in the evening when you go to sleep and peak levels in the morning right before you wake up. This suggests that cortisol plays a significant role in the initiation of wakefulness and plays a part in your body’s circadian rhythm.\nTumors that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

Still, Stamoulis isn’t too worried about the long-term consequences of wearing masks.\n“It can feel like trying on a different ‘role’ and the associated expectations of that role, perhaps freeing us of what can feel exhausting and insincere about smiling (especially when we aren't having a good day).” Masks may be small – after all, they leave our bodies, eyes and hair on show – but by covering our mouths they conceal part of our emotional expression. “The fear of someone who is socially anxious of showing an emotion that could be judged negatively may in part be mitigated by the mask – a smirk may be missed and a person who is socially anxious may then feel more safe.” ... For some, masks serve as both a psychological and physical safety barrier, helping wearers blend in and subvert judgement about their appearances (Credit: Alamy)\nWearing a mask is, for most of us, an annoying but worthwhile sacrifice: it’s one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of Covid-19. Still, most of us look forward to the day when we can bare our faces in public again. Face-coverings fog our glasses and clog our pores; they make it harder to smile at strangers and recognise friends.\nYet some are secretly relishing the new mask-wearing mandates, for reasons ranging from the convenient and expedient to the more complex and psychological. Some welcome the way face coverings reduce or change interactions that might otherwise spark social anxiety. But is this a helpful coping mechanism – and what happens when the pandemic comes to an end? ... Ever had a job that required you to smile?

Skeletal remains show the mother kneeling down on the ground with her arms around her son in central China · Archaeologists unearthed proof of a mother’s love in Qinghai province, China, when they discovered the 4,000-year-old skeletons of a mother and child still locked in a dying embrace.\nThe mother was trying to shield her child from a massive earthquake that struck China in 2000 BC and triggered massive floods; the event is sometimes referred to as ‘China’s Pompeii’. The site is riddled with tragic scenes. Lajia Ruins Museum, located in northwest China’s Qinghai province, is a 4000-year-old earthquake relic, with very well preserved artefacts and skeletons.\nIt is also very important because it holds early clues to an early Bronze Age civilization that lived in the upper Yellow River region and of which we know very little about. But from a human point of view, it’s just heartbreaking.\nThese people had a rough fate, they were killed by a disaster they could do nothing to protect themselves against; they couldn’t even protect their children, try as they might.

Saline Nasal Irrigations (SNIs) can reduce the viral load in the nasal cavities. Oral rinse with antimicrobial agents is efficacious in reducing the viral load in oral fluids. We advocate the inclusion of SNIs and ethanol oral rinses as additional measures to the current public health measures, to prevent and control the transmission of any respiratory infectious disease, including COVID-19.\nChlorhexidine and alcohol-based mouthwash might cause staining of tooth surfaces, restorations, and the tongue, alteration in taste, an increase in tartar formation, irritation, and mucosal damage with long-term daily use.12 Until a vaccine becomes available, which is not expected for another 12–18 months from now if everything works well, we should implement quickly and effectively non-pharmaceutical interventions including nasal irrigation and oral rinse to reduce the burden of COVID-19. Randomized clinical trials on large population are needed to verify the efficacy of SNIs and oral rinses in preventing spread of COVID-19 evaluating the number of episodes, viral load in the nasal cavities, transmission within household contacts, medication consumption, reported illness, school and work absence, and complication rate.\nKeywords: COVID-19 infection, oral rinses, prevention, saline nasal irrigations ...

Staudt, and Mark Roschewski at NIH’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Mihalis Lionakis at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases (NIAID) tested the off-label use of a BTK inhibitor called acalabrutinib to treat COVID-19.\nEarly data showed that off-label use of a cancer drug reduced respiratory distress and over-reactive immune responses in patients with COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cancer | COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines\nContent:\nPeople being treated for cancer may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 are generally worse in people with cancer than in people without cancer.1-4 A meta-analysis of 46,499 patients with COVID-19 showed that all-cause mortality (risk ratio 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33–2.07) was higher in patients with cancer, and that patients with cancer were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units (risk ratio 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31–1.87).5 A patient’s risk of immunosuppression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection depend on the type of cancer, the treatments administered, and the stage of disease (e.g., patients actively being treated compared to those in remission).\nIn a study that used data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium Registry, patients with cancer who were in remission or who had no evidence of disease had a lower risk of death from COVID-19 than those who were receiving active treatment.6 It is unclear whether cancer survivors have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and its complications when compared with people without a history of cancer.\nGiven the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in the general population and the increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality in patients with cancer, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible for patients with active cancer and for patients receiving treatment for cancer (AIII).\nFor example, people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were treated with Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax with or without anti-CD20 antibodies had extremely low response rates (16.0% and 13.6%, respectively).18 In comparison, approximately 80% to 95% of patients with solid tumors showed immunologic responses.8,19,20 Several observational studies support the use of a third vaccine dose in patients with cancer, even though vaccine failure may still occur.21-23 See the CDC website COVID-19 Vaccines for People Who Are Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised for guidance on vaccine dosing.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-07-19\nTitle: Cancer and COVID-19: What protection do antiviral therapies provide?\nContent:\nVaccination should be considered the first line of prevention against COVID-19.

Other factors that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 include having a weakened immune system (being immunocompromised), older age, and other medical conditions.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel (new) coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019, which is abbreviated COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads, the virus can change, which results in new variants. Some variants may spread more easily than others or be more resistant to vaccines or treatments. If you have cancer, you have a higher risk of severe COVID-19.\nNCI is conducting a large study of people with cancer who have COVID-19 to learn more about the risk factors for COVID-19 and to help doctors better manage treatment for people with cancer and COVID-19. If you had cancer in the past, you also may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19, and you may want to discuss your concerns about COVID-19 with your doctors.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 provide details about a study investigating the potential benefits of the cancer drug acalabrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, in treating patients with severe COVID-19. The study was conducted by researchers from the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and four other hospitals in the United States. The study found that administering acalabrutinib to patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for 10-14 days reduced respiratory distress and overactive immune responses.\n\nInformation 3 provides information about the increased risk of severe COVID-19 and worse clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. It also mentions that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in the general population and the increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality in patients with cancer support the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible for patients with active cancer and for patients receiving treatment for cancer.\n\nInformation 4 discusses the antiviral treatment for COVID-19, including PAXLOVID, which can lessen symptoms in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of getting severely worse. Patients with cancer are eligible to receive PAXLOVID with a prescription from their doctor and they will need to start it within 5 days of the onset of their COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nInformation 5, published by the National Cancer Institute, states that people with cancer have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and that SARS-CoV-2 can change, resulting in new variants. NCI is conducting a large study of people with cancer who have COVID-19 to learn more about the risk factors for COVID-19 and to help doctors better manage treatment for people with cancer and COVID-19.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"A cancer drug may quench inflammation in severely ill COVID-19 patients\" is true. The drug acalabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, has been shown to reduce respiratory distress and overactive immune responses in patients with severe COVID-19. However, it is important to note that acalabrutinib is not approved as a treatment for COVID-19 and further research is needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in this context.", "response": "TRUE."}

The situation was critical, and the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden, had to manage the crisis.\n\nInformation 2: During the final days of the 2020 presidential campaign, President Trump accused Joe Biden of mishandling the swine flu outbreak in 2009-2010, calling it a \"total disaster\" and claiming that if the coronavirus had the same lethality as H1N1, 700,000 people would have died.\n\nInformation 3: In April 2009, Vice President Biden's comments about avoiding confined spaces during the swine flu outbreak drew criticism from the travel industry.\n\nInformation 4: Throughout the 2020 presidential campaign, President Trump repeatedly referred to remarks made by Ron Klain, a former chief of staff for Joe Biden, who criticized the Obama administration's handling of the swine flu pandemic.\n\nInformation 5: In September 2020, President Trump claimed that the Obama administration was a \"disaster\" in their response to the swine flu outbreak, citing criticism from Biden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim made in 2020-09-10 by an unidentified speaker about Joe Biden's handling of the swine flu outbreak is mostly accurate in terms of the failed approach, but it lacks context and specificity. The claim that Biden called it \"N1H1\" instead of \"H1N1\" is incorrect.\n\nThe swine flu outbreak in 2009-2010 was indeed a significant challenge for the Obama administration, and there were some missteps, such as Vice President Biden's comments about avoiding confined spaces, which drew criticism. However, the claim that the Obama administration's response was a \"total disaster\" is a matter of interpretation and depends on the specific metrics used to evaluate the response.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the swine flu had a lower fatality rate compared to the coronavirus, and the Obama administration's response to the swine flu outbreak cannot be directly compared to the current administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some truth to the claim that Joe Biden's approach to the swine flu outbreak was flawed, the claim lacks context and specificity. Additionally, the claim that Biden called it \"N1H1\" is incorrect. The claim that the Obama administration's response was a \"total disaster\" is a matter of interpretation and depends on the specific metrics used to evaluate the response.", "response": "FALSE."}

Gates also frequently criticized the U.S. response to the pandemic under former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Fauci sometimes received criticism from Trump while serving as the former president's advisor, including after contradicting false claims Trump made about the severity of the pandemic. Various conspiracy theories targeting Gates, Fauci and others have frequently circulated online, especially on social media, where some platforms took steps to remove posts that spread misinformation.\nIn October, Gates told CNBC that he was concerned that baseless conspiracy theories about himself and Fauci could be harmful to the U.S. coronavirus response if they chipped away at people's trust in public health strategies, such as the rollout of Covid vaccines.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-21, is an article from Fatabyyano stating that the claim about the coronavirus being a hoax to pass Bill Gates' vaccine is false. The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 has been observed through microscopic imagery. The allegation about Bill Gates' vaccine is not based on any evidence.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-05-29, is an article from BBC News discussing conspiracy theories about Bill Gates' involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic. These theories include claims that Gates wants to use a COVID-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin. The Italian Parliament has seen an anti-vaccination movement, with an independent MP calling for Gates to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-09-10, is an article from Reuters fact-checking a conspiracy theory that Bill Gates is responsible for COVID-19. The article also addresses false claims about population control and the misinterpretation of a speech given by Gates at a TED conference in 2010.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-05, is an article from BBC News discussing Bill Gates becoming the voodoo doll of COVID-19 conspiracies. The article mentions various conspiracy theories, including Gates wanting to use a COVID-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is an article from Business Insider discussing Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci being targets of baseless coronavirus conspiracy theories. The article mentions false claims about Gates and Fauci being linked to the coronavirus' origins and Gates planning to use COVID-19 vaccines to implant monitoring microchips in billions of people.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that there is nothing called coronavirus and it is just a hoax to pass Bill Gates' vaccine is false. The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 has been observed through microscopic imagery, and the claim about Bill Gates' vaccine is not based on any evidence.

New recommendations for the management of metabolic and bariatric surgery candidates during and after the COVID-19 pandemic shift the focus from body mass index (BMI) alone to medical conditions most likely to be ameliorated by the procedures.\nSo, better prioritizing and triaging patients likely will be more important down the line, given how effective surgery has been shown to be now, both short-term and long-term.\" The new document extensively discusses the risks of obesity — including now as a major COVID-19 risk factor — and the benefits of the procedures and risks of delaying them. It also addresses ongoing management of patients who had bariatric/metabolic surgery in the past and nonsurgical treatment to mitigate harm until patients can undergo the procedures.\nThe document confirms that bariatric/metabolic surgery should remain suspended during the most intense phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and only resume once overall restrictions on nonessential surgeries are lifted. Exceptions are limited to emergency endoscopic interventions for complications of prior surgery, such as hemorrhage or leaks. A section offers guidance for pharmacologic and other nonsurgical options to mitigate harm from delaying the procedures including use of drugs that promote weight loss, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Bariatric and metabolic surgery during and after the COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nThese permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active.

The survey also showed a large variation in the bariatric surgeons’ views on when bariatric surgery could re-start, and tried to understand their thoughts on safeguards that would allow them to resume bariatric surgery safely during this pandemic. Significantly, a fifth of the surgeons were unwilling to start bariatric surgery again till the COVID-19 pandemic subsided completely.\nThere is a lack of published data on COVID-19 and bariatric surgery [6].

In fact, the law mentions a very solid reason to extend such a period, either with or without a visa, such as serious medical reasons.We must emphasise the fact it is very very difficult to extend such a period in a legal, secure, and reliable way.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: How Long Can I Be Outside Spain Without Losing my Residency?\nContent:\nMost of them intend to stay in the country for the long term, and not just for one or two years.

However, if the Government wants to extend the state of alarm beyond the initial fifteen days it needs authorization from the Congreso de Diputados (Congress of Deputies). During a state of alarm, the government can impose limitations to rights but not their suspension. This distinction has implications beyond the Spanish borders since only derogations of rights, rather than their limitation, need to be notified to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (for States that have notified Covid-related derogations see here) and the United Nations to fulfill relevant human rights obligations.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-07-05\nTitle: State of alarm (Spain) - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose.

The Government shall declare the state of alarm by decree, decided upon by the Council of Ministers, and shall specify the territorial area to which the effects of the proclamation shall apply. It can last up to 15 days at maximum and only be extended, with no limit, by the authorization of the Congress.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nThe information provided consists of five pieces from various sources, discussing the Spanish state of alarm and its relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of alarm is regulated by Article 116 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and Organic Law 4/1981. The government can declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it. The state of alarm allows the government to impose limitations on rights but not suspend them. This has implications for human rights obligations, as only derogations of rights need to be notified to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the United Nations.\n\nThe Spanish government declared a state of alarm on March 14, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, which enforced a lockdown of people in all Spanish territory. This state of alarm ended on June 21, 2020. During the state of alarm, the government can make use of the general authorization contained in Article 86.1 of the Spanish Constitution, which allows it to make legally binding rules in cases of \"extraordinary and urgent need,\" which are of a provisional nature until they are validated or repealed by the Congress of Deputies.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim states that the Spanish government asks Congress to renew the state of alarm every 15 days because it is required by law. Based on the provided information, the claim is partially correct. The Spanish government does declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it. However, the information does not explicitly state that the government \"asks Congress to renew the state of alarm every 15 days because it is required by law.\" Instead, it is implied that the government requests an extension after the initial 15-day period.\n\nConsidering the provided information and the publication date of the claim (2020-05-05), it is reasonable to assume that the claim is accurate, as the state of alarm was in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government would have needed to request extensions from the Congress of Deputies to maintain the state of alarm beyond the initial 15-day period.", "response": "FALSE."}

It also shows that 3,150 health impact events were reported through V-safe by Dec. 18. “Health impact events” are defined by the CDC as “unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional”.\nWhile the CDC spokeswoman did not specify the symptoms reported by the V-safe registrants or provide a detailed breakdown of the 3,150 health impact events, she said: “We anticipate anyone getting vaccinated may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-01-28\nTitle: Video falsely claims Pfizer vaccine causes widespread 'irreversible' ...\nContent:\nA CDC presentation on anaphylaxis following the receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines shows that 112,807 people registered with V-Safe had received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (page 6). The app recorded 3,150 “health impact events”, which equates to 2.8 per cent of cases.\nNikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide, told AAP FactCheck that “health impact events” encompass any event where the vaccine recipient is unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or requires care from a doctor or health care professional. “Typically this will be short term vaccine-related symptoms like fever, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, nausea etc., which can last for up to a week after immunisation,” Prof Petrovsky said in an email. “This percentage of health impact events is entirely in keeping with the reported clinical trial data.”\nRather, the December data captured 3,150 health impact events among 112,807 vaccine recipients. These events are generally short-term, mild side effects that are expected after vaccination, experts said. Only six cases of anaphylaxis had been reported among more than 270,000 Pfizer vaccine recipients in the US at that time.\nProf Petrovsky said there were no criteria for the duration or severity of health impact events in order for them to be included in the count. A case could be included even if the symptoms lasted for only a day, just as it would be counted if a recipient “saw a doctor to get a prescription for paracetamol or missed a day of work”, he said. A spokeswoman for the CDC told Reuters the figure of 112,807 was not the total number of vaccine recipients in the US, as suggested in the Facebook video.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-11-03\nTitle: How to Address COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation | CDC\nContent:\nWays to identify and address misinformation on social media and beyond.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-05-17\nTitle: Statement for healthcare professionals: How COVID-19 vaccines are ...\nContent:\nHealthcare professionals and public health authorities have a central role in discussing vaccination against COVID-19 with their patients. Vaccines play a critical role in preventing deaths, and hospitalisation caused by infectious diseases, and are contributing to controlling the spread of the disease, thus their impact on infection and serious illness is significant.\nA series of studies in a number of countries, both those published in the medical literature and surveillance following use of COVID-19 vaccines carried out by public health bodies and regulators, examining many tens of thousands of pregnancies did not find a higher risk of severe side effects, complications, miscarriages or premature births following vaccination. At the same time, several studies have shown that COVID-19 infection can have very serious impacts on pregnancy outcomes in certain women, and that the benefits of receiving mRNA outweigh risks for pregnant women and their unborn children.\nThe global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented level of public interest in vaccines. This includes a focus on the development of vaccines and their regulatory review and safety monitoring. Much of this coverage has taken place through mass and social media. Reports of adverse events (side effects) have led some people to express concerns about getting vaccinated, delay getting vaccinated or be strongly opposed to vaccination.\nHealthcare professionals and public health authorities have a central role in discussing vaccination against COVID-19 with their patients.

The video claims that 3% of vaccinated individuals will be unable to perform normal daily activities based on a table showing 3,150 health impact events out of 112,807 vaccinated individuals. However, this is a misinterpretation as health impact events were only reported by users of the V-safe app, not all vaccine recipients.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-01-28, provides further context on the CDC presentation about anaphylaxis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine, explains that health impact events include any event where the vaccine recipient is unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or requires care from a doctor or health care professional. These events are generally short-term, mild side effects that are expected after vaccination.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2021-11-03, provides guidance from the CDC on how to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on social media and beyond.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-05-17, emphasizes the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 for pregnant women and their unborn children.

This is in line with Information 1, which confirms the video misinterprets the figures and incorrectly calculates the percentage of health impact events. The correct interpretation is provided in Information 2, where Nikolai Petrovsky explains that health impact events include any event where the vaccine recipient is unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or requires care from a doctor or health care professional. These events are generally short-term, mild side effects that are expected after vaccination. Therefore, the claim is true based on the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

A LNP contain an ionizable lipid, a stabilizing agent for stability, a phospholipid to stabilize the bilayer and PEG. The ionizable lipid allows self-assembly, increase the encapsulation of mRNA and helps to escape from endosomes. The PEG minimizes LNPs' nonspecific binding to proteins, increases circulation time in blood and helps to avoid RES uptake [50,51]. BNT162b2 is a lipid NP-formulated nucleotide-modified RNA vaccine which encodes a membrane anchored, perfusion stabilized full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [63]. The phase I/II trials showed that the vaccine was well tolerated in young (18–55 years of age) and older (65–85 years of age) adults [64]. The participant groups received two doses at a dose level of 10, 20 and 30 μg with a 21-day interval between the two doses.\nFurther, the interaction between the neutral lipids and the blood cell membranes is less, hence improve the LNPs’ biocompatibility [44]. At low pH, the ionizable lipid becomes positively charged as they are protonated which enables RNA complexation. The PEGylated lipid reduces opsonization process hence avoid uptake by phagocytes and increase their circulation time in blood. Cholesterol and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) help to incorporate the drug into the LNPs [37,63,71,72]. The molar ratios of the positively charged lipid:PEGylated lipid:cholesterol:DSPC are 46.3:1.6:42.7:9.4 and 50:1.5:38.5:10 for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines respectively [37,73]. Before administration, BNT162b2 requires thawing and subsequent dilution with saline solution, but mRNA-1273, after thawing, could be administered directly as it is without further dilution with saline solution.\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have great potential to deliver nucleic acids including mRNAs. The two mRNA-based vaccines namely the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) have been given emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US-FDA to prevent SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 and the vaccines were developed using LNPs.\nTherefore, many vaccines have been developed and their safety and efficacy have been evaluated in clinical trials and several vaccines got EUA and many are in clinical trials. Nucleic acids have been emerging as potential drugs to treat a variety of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been studied extensively to deliver a wide range of drugs including vaccines.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery | Nature Reviews Materials\nContent:\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a new category of therapeutic agent to prevent and treat various diseases. To function in vivo, mRNA requires safe, effective and stable delivery systems that protect the nucleic acid from degradation and that allow cellular uptake and mRNA release. Lipid nanoparticles have successfully entered the clinic for the delivery of mRNA; in particular, lipid nanoparticle–mRNA vaccines are now in clinical use against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which marks a milestone for mRNA therapeutics.\nOther COVID-19 vaccines based on lipid nanoparticle–mRNA formulations are also under evaluation in different clinical phases (Table 1). In preclinical studies, some vaccine candidates showed protective effects by delivering self-amplifying RNA encoding the spike protein40,186,187 (Box 2), a cocktail of mRNAs encoding three viral proteins74, modified mRNA encoding the receptor-binding domain188 or spike mRNA with engineered untranslated regions107. Fig. 4: Lipid nanoparticle–mRNA formulations as COVID-19 vaccines.\nVarious cancer vaccines based on lipid nanoparticle–mRNA formulations are currently in clinical trials (Table 1).

When the LNP is inside the acidic endosome (middle), the ionizable lipids become positively charged and help release the LNP and mRNA into the cell's cytoplasm.\nBy 2005, the development of better and safer LNPs was driven by excitement for a new technology, called small interfering RNA (siRNA), for selectively silencing genes. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which became the leading siRNA company, quickly realized that existing nanoparticles were not very good at helping siRNA get into cells. The company struck multiple partnerships to make new LNPs, including with Protiva in 2005 and Inex in 2006. The groups made more than 300 ionizable lipids, first optimizing the fatty tails, then tweaking the ionizable head group and the linker region in between.\nThe endosome’s acidic interior protonates the heads of the ionizable lipids, making them positively charged. That positive charge triggers a change in the shape of the nanoparticle, which scientists think helps it break free from the endosome and ultimately release its RNA cargo into the cell’s cytoplasm.\nA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) contains hundreds of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, each surrounded by ionizable lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. The outside of the particle is coated in pegylated lipids. LNPs for messenger RNA (mRNA) are made with similar ingredients but contain only a few mRNA strands.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-05, is a fact-check article that confirms the lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are used as delivery vehicles to protect and transport the mRNA component of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, with no publication date, discusses the structure and stability of mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) COVID-19 vaccines, mentioning that they need to be stored at low temperatures and suggesting ways to improve their stability.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, provides details about lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and their role in the development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, including the composition of LNPs and the molar ratios of their components.\n\nInformation 4, with no publication date, highlights the use of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA formulations in COVID-19 vaccines and cancer vaccines, mentioning various clinical trials and preclinical studies.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-03-31, explains the mechanism of how lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) release their mRNA cargo into the cell's cytoplasm after entering the cell through an endosome.\n\nClaim, published on 2020-12-05, states that lipid nanoparticles in a COVID-19 vaccine are there to transport RNA molecules.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is: TRUE.

While it is a general medical term used to describe a damaging immune and blood-clotting response to a lung injury, DAD is not a disease, but instead a condition potentially caused by a variety of diseases. That finding — along with the presence of clotting cells known as \"platelet-fibrin thrombi\" in the patients' lungs — suggested to the authors that preventing complications from blood clotting (coagulopathy) could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments.\nPerhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection. \"Breaking Covid news!\" began a loosely intelligible bit of copypasta from late May, \"Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium.\"\nThe claim that went viral on several social media platforms blends the misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper with the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that no autopsies be performed on COVID-19 victims — a paranoid flourish used to imply a global conspiracy. By ignoring this alleged ban, the story goes, Italian doctors revealed that COVID-19 was actually a bacteria, and that, for some reason, aspirin can cure the disease.\nAn inaccurate copypasta description of this study from mid-May interpreted those results as evidence that Covid-19 stemmed from \"a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,\" that death from the disease stems from thrombosis (or blood clotting), and that the COVID-19 \"ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.\" This is how aspirin entered the zeitgeist. As a drug with anticoagulant properties, it could theoretically be employed to reduce complications from thrombosis. Perhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* COVID-19 is a virus, not a bacterium (Information 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n* The World Health Organization (WHO) has conducted a systematic review of 73 studies into the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, disclofenac, and naproxen on acute respiratory viruses and found no evidence to prove aspirin could cure or treat COVID-19 (Information 1).\n* Claims that COVID-19 is a bacterium that can be treated with aspirin or a coagulant are false and have been debunked by fact-checkers and government fact-checking agencies (Information 3 and 4).\n* A preliminary and unpublished research paper from Italy suggested that preventing complications from blood clotting could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments (Information 5).\n* Online claims that this Italian study exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection and that aspirin can cure the disease are baseless and have been debunked (Information 5).\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that COVID-19 is a bacterium that is easily treated with aspirin or a coagulant is false.

However, the restrictions continued, and the Ministry of Health insisted on maintaining social distancing, hand washing, and minimizing time spent outside.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-12-01, is a Wikipedia article about the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica.

Identifying, explaining and addressing the motivations that make rule breakers tick is necessary to end the crisis for everyone.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic lashes countries in a second (and in some cases, third) wave of infections, patience and solidarity are giving way to frustration and blame. Officials in the United States and Germany say the latest upsurge in infections in their countries is a consequence of a selfish minority that is ignoring basic social distancing rules, while Berlin’s tourism authority has launched a colorful campaign—complete with an old lady and an offensive finger—chastising visitors who refuse to wear masks.\nFor instance, we found that fear of financial loss caused by virus containment strategies—rather than health risks—was often a stronger motivator for abiding by or ignoring government rules.

In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks, steam sterilization (e.g. in laminate sterilization wrappings) of used masks at 121 ⁰C in laminated bags, is a simple, useful, cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks safe for reuse.\nIn preparation for that scarcity we performed a study to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks in order to verify their re-usability with a method that could be applied in practice using already available equipment. Therefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags.\nTherefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes are sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus based on the knowledge of inactivation of such viruses. [1,2] A blind comparison of unused sterilized masks was performed with respect to visual inspection, consistency, face fit and breathing resistance.\nBefore sterilization, the batches were individually packed in laminate bags and sterilized with steam sterilization by means of 121 ⁰C in Getinge autoclaves and in combination with permeable laminate bags, Halyard type CLFP150X300WI-S20.

The new coronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, and ultraviolet disinfection does not affect the filtration efficiency of respirators.\nThe premise of using the mask again after disinfection is that the sterilized mask can neither affect the free circulation of air nor destroy the filtering mechanism of the mask. So, what kind of disinfection can meet these two points? To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device.

Here, immunostaining reveals increased levels of the adhesion molecule PECAM-1 on endothelial cells in brain tissue from patients who died from COVID-19.\nThe scientists found evidence that antibodies—proteins produced by the immune system in response to viruses and other invaders—are involved in an attack on the cells lining the brain’s blood vessels, leading to inflammation and damage. Consistent with an earlier study from the group, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the patients’ brains, suggesting the virus was not infecting the brain directly. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 can trigger brain damage may help inform development of therapies for COVID-19 patients who have lingering neurological symptoms.\nFor the first time, researchers observed deposits of immune complexes—molecules formed when antibodies bind antigens (foreign substances)—on the surface of endothelial cells in the brains of COVID-19 patients. Such immune complexes can damage tissue by triggering inflammation. The study builds on their previous research, which found evidence of brain damage caused by thinning and leaky blood vessels. They suspected that the damage may have been due to the body’s natural inflammatory response to the virus.\nNath and his team found that antibodies produced in response to COVID-19 may mistakenly target cells crucial to the blood-brain barrier.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

The shipment contained 117,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, adding to the Colombian government's ongoing vaccination campaign. Colombia expects to receive 20 million doses of vaccines through COVAX in 2021. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) directors have praised Colombia's efforts in preparing for the arrival of the COVAX vaccines.\n\nInformation 2 clarifies that the claim stating Colombia is the last country in South America to start vaccination is false. Paraguay and Uruguay have not started vaccination, and the first vaccines that arrived in Colombia were from a bilateral negotiation between Pfizer and Colombia.\n\nInformation 3 is unrelated to the claim or the other information, as it discusses dengue in the Americas.\n\nInformation 5, while not available at the time of the claim's publication, confirms that Colombia was the first country in Latin America to receive COVAX-procured vaccines. The information also mentions that other countries, such as Peru, El Salvador, and Bolivia, are expected to receive doses as part of the first vaccine deployment.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is:\n\nTRUE, with the clarification that Colombia is not the last country in South America to start vaccination. The first vaccines that arrived in Colombia were from a bilateral negotiation between Pfizer and Colombia, not from the COVAX initiative as stated in the claim. However, Colombia was the first country in Latin America to receive COVAX-procured vaccines.", "response": "FALSE."}

One of the pronouncement made by President Duterte related to the Luzon-wide lockdown is implementing a ceasefire with the CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army) rebels. Presidential Spokesperson Panelo said that the ceasefire starts on March 19, 2020, and will end on April 15, 2020.\nThe first ECQ and first MECQ were implemented between March 17 and May 31, 2020. This was announced on March 16, two days after the government of the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila under a \"community quarantine\" on March 14. It was implemented throughout Luzon from March 17 until May 15, and remained in areas with a moderate to high risk of infection until May 31.\nTV5 has also reorganized their television programming because of the ECQ. On March 15, 2020, the Film Development Council of the Philippines ordered the stopping of the production of film, television and other audio-visual content during the community quarantine.\nThe organization earlier advised the Philippine authorities to contemplate on the \"epidemiological situation\" with regards to the lifting of the Luzon lockdown. In his address to the public on April 24, Duterte declared that the ECQ is prolonged up to May 15, 2020, only for Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Central Luzon (except Aurora), and other areas in Luzon that are deemed high-risk to critical-risk for COVID-19.\nThe enhanced community quarantine in Luzon was a series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures implemented by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on the island of Luzon and its associated islands.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2024-01-07\nTitle: COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe imposition of a \"localized lockdown\" involving measures at the barangay, situ and/or purok levels instead of removing all ECQs has been suggested as an alternative. On April 6, 2020, the following localities were under enhanced community quarantine: all regions of Luzon, Western Visayas, Caraga Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Samar, Biliran, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Cotabato, South Cotabato, Tawi-Tawi, and the municipality of Catarman in Northern Samar.\nOn November 22, 2021, the IATF further extended the ALS to the remaining areas of the Cordillera Administrative Region, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Mimaropa, and the Caraga regions thereby completely phasing-out the previous community quarantine classification system that has been in place since March 2020. By December 3, 2021, the whole Philippines is under Alert Level 2. This alert level system would be in place until December 31. Alert level 3 is placed in Metro Manila in January 3; Bulacan, Cavite and Rizal on January 5 and Laguna on January 7 until January 15 due to the recent spike of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases.\nOn April 24, 2020, it was clarified that local government units can no longer impose quarantine measures without the consent of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). Prior to that period, localities could impose such measures with coordination with the DILG. Duterte issued Executive Order 112, extending enhanced community quarantine in select localities until May 15 and imposing a general community quarantine in the rest of the country, also overriding existing quarantine measures by local government units, starting May 1.\nOn May 12, 2020, it was originally announced that community quarantine measures will be lifted in 41 provinces and 11 cities across the country due to their being low risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but were eventually upgraded to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) after receiving petitions from LGUs starting May 16. On May 15, 2020, the IATF-EID approved the appeal of Mayor Lani Mercado-Revilla placing the city of Bacoor in the province of Cavite under modified enhanced community quarantine.\nCOVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines were series of stay-at-home orders and cordon sanitaire measures that have been implemented by the government of the Philippines through its Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Extension of Enhanced Community Quarantine in the Philippines | ...\nContent:\nIn view of the extension of the ECQ, Insights Philippines Legal Advisors will continue to observe a work-from-home policy for all lawyers and staff until 15 May 2020.

Cuban government regulations provide that workers may be disciplined for being “friends” with people who hold “hostile or contrary views to the Cuban revolution.” Health workers may also face criminal penalties if they “abandon” their jobs. “Cuban doctors deployed to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic provide valuable services to many communities, but at the expense of their most basic freedoms,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.\nIn a January 2020 response, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, the Cuban government denied the allegations, saying that rapporteurs had been “used to foment spurious campaigns … by the US government.” The rights group Prisoners Defenders gathered statements, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, by dozens of health workers who participated in missions prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, between 2001 and 2018.\n“Governments interested in receiving support from Cuban doctors should press the Cuban government to overhaul this Orwellian system that dictates with whom doctors can live, fall in love, or talk.” According to the Cuban government, over the past nearly 60 years, Cuba has deployed over 400,000 health workers across 164 countries to help tackle short-term crises, natural disasters, and, currently, the Covid-19 pandemic.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-14\nTitle: Cuba sends 'white coat army' of doctors to fight coronavirus in ...\nContent:\nNearly 40 countries across five continents have received Cuban medics during the pandemic, as the island nation has once more punched far above its weight in medical diplomacy.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How Cuba’s doctors are helping the world fight COVID-19\nContent:\nBetween 2006 and 2016, more than 7,000 Cuban doctors escaped to start a new life within the borders of their capitalist neighbour.

The case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2013 that simply isolating a natural product is not enough to warrant a patent. But just because some research centres and companies filed to patent animal coronaviruses and the human SARS virus means absolutely nothing with regards to the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nWe have seen Mike Adams, the Plandemic conspiracy film, and a recent French video viewed by nearly 1.5 million people claim that a trail of patent applications prove that scientists created the COVID-19 coronavirus in a laboratory. They also apparently decided to protect their intellectual property along the way.\nThere are two lessons I want to draw from this on-going patent fear-mongering. The first is that “coronavirus” is not a word that only applies to the agent behind COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a subfamily in the grand classification of viruses. They include our current enemy, SARS-CoV-2, but also a different coronavirus that caused SARS nearly twenty years ago, and the coronavirus that produces the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nA French conspiracy video making the rounds points to a coronavirus patent held by the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Université Paris VII (EP 1 694 829 B1). The video even goes so far as to accuse France of creating the COVID-19 coronavirus and releasing it in Wuhan.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: US20200279585A1 - System and Method for Testing for COVID-19 - ...\nContent:\nA method is provided for acquiring and transmitting biometric data (e.g., vital signs) of a user, where the data is analyzed to determine whether the user is suffering from a viral infection, such as COVID-19.

The article mentions a patent for a \"System and Method for Testing for COVID-19\" (EP 1 694 829 B1) that was found on a Dutch website, but it does not mention COVID-19 and was filed in 2017 as a predecessor to 'US20200279585A1'.

Some COVID-19 vaccine use a fragment of messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct your body to make an immune response against COVID-19. There is a crucial difference between mRNA and DNA.\nThe mRNA is broken down quickly by the body. It never enters the nucleus, and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code. Instead, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines teach the cell how to make a protein that triggers an immune response specific to COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The COVID-19 vaccine does not change human DNA | UNICEF\nContent:\nThe materials that make up the coronavirus vaccine are based on ribonucleic acids (RNA), and when they enter the body, they do not penetrate the nucleus at all, so they do not have a chance of coming into contact with the hereditary material contained in it; therefore, we conclude that vaccination will not cause any harm to the body, especially in terms of changing the structure of the DNA chain. Having considered the facts and evidence in the form of the views and statements of experts, we have come to the conclusion that the information regarding harmful effects of the vaccine against COVID-19 on human DNA is unfounded and untrue.\nTo determine whether the information published in the media and on social networks is true, we were engaged to check posts, one of which was a statement that the coronavirus vaccine changes human DNA. The World Health Organization was the first to respond to this statement with the explanation: “COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously tested for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a long-lasting immune response.\nHaving considered the facts and evidence in the form of the views and statements of experts, we have come to the conclusion that the information regarding harmful effects of the vaccine against COVID-19 on human DNA is unfounded and untrue.

Remarkably, the cGAS-STING pathway has been recently reported as a critical driver of aberrant type-I IFN responses in severe cases of COVID-19, a disease caused by an RNA virus, not a DNA virus [112]. Given that strict compartmentalization of cellular DNA in the nucleus and mitochondria is necessary to avoid sensing self-DNA, the source of cytosolic immunostimulatory DNA following SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown but could be explained by LINE-1 driven reverse transcription fo\nThese findings should not be overlooked in light of the growing number of cases of acute myocarditis and myopericarditis reported in mRNA vaccine recipients, particularly in young males following the second dose [120], [121], [122], which led the FDA to issue a warning on the increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following the second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.3 Considering that the human TREX1 gene exhibits mutations and that TREX1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been related to severe outcome of infectious disease [123] and autoimmune conditions [124] in humans, it is possible that polymorphisms in TREX1 and in other genes that encode proteins that directly or indirectly regulate cytosolic DNA sensors, may determine susceptibility to nms-mRNA vaccines, influence response to immunization, and influence susceptibility to severe inflammatory disorders, including myocarditis, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Our hypothesis must be tested experimentally usi\nIn addition, the pro-inflammatory status and the activation of intracellular RNA and DNA sensors would unsilence endogenous retroelements. These molecular events would increase the risk of genomic, chromosomal, and cellular instability, and carcinogenesis. Although mouse models of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [127], SARS-CoV [128], and influenza [129] show vigorous induction of type-I and -III IFNs, the involvement of these cytokines in COVID-19 patients is contentious.\nHence, individuals with particular genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode DNA sensors, such as TREX1, that are exposed to cellular stress and inflammatory stimuli related to the nms-mRNA and to the accumulation of DNA following up-regulation of TEs, may be at more risk of developing severe inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and carcinogenesis. If this is so, then the ‘one size fits all’ approach of mass vaccination using nms-mRNA technology would not be a safe public health measure for humanity. If our hypothesis were to be confirmed, the implications for public health would be staggering and appalling in the context of the mass-scale COVID-19 vaccination already taking place, particularly if the nms-mRNA enters brain [82], bone marrow [84], and – if already present in the vaccinee – cancerous or pre-cancerous cells [143], or if the vaccine is administered to females early in their pregnancy and the nms-mRNA transfects embryonic cells [77]. It stands to reason that if our hypot\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-27, is a fact-check by Agência Lupa stating that there is no scientific evidence for the claims that COVID-19 does not kill anyone and that the vaccine can alter your DNA, affect fertility, or cause homosexuality.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-05-08, is from the Australian government's health department website, explaining that COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA.

One new RCT (4) and 2 new observational studies (18, 19) compared N95 versus surgical masks in health care settings. The RCT (n = 1009) was done in Canada, Israel, Pakistan, and Egypt and compared instruction to use N95 versus surgical masks in HCWs providing routine patient care (4). Surgical masks were noninferior to N95s for risk for PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR, 1.14 [CI, 0.77 to 1.69]) on the basis of a prespecified noninferiority margin of up to a doubling of risk.\nThe original review, done near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, included only 2 observational studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection that provided insufficient evidence (2).

It was because they have a different test that can check for both influenza and COVID-19 simultaneously – which is known as the \"multiplexed method.\"\nA PCR test is an excellent identifier of COVID-19 cases, because of something called specificity. Basically, specificity means that the test is designed to only detect one type of virus. Dr. Broadhurst says, \"The PCR test is validated against many different coronaviruses and common respiratory viruses, including influenza so that it would not give false-positive results.\"\nOur researchers took clinical samples from before Nebraska had community spread of COVID-19 and ran the samples through the test. These clinical samples included known results of influenza and other common viruses. The PCR test reported negative on all of them, which makes sense.\nThe bottom line: PCR tests remain the gold standard for detecting an active COVID-19 infection.

In fact, PCR tests are designed to detect very specific areas of the viral genome, so tests do not get confused between which virus is present, said Matthew Binnicker, director of the clinical virology lab at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “PCR tests, including the one developed by the CDC, are highly accurate and are able to differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza,” Binnicker said. “In other words, a COVID-19 test will not be positive if a person really has influenza, and vice versa.”\nCLAIM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revoked Emergency Use Authorization for coronavirus PCR tests because they were inaccurate, led to false positives and confused positive influenza cases with COVID-19.\nTHE FACTS: The FDA has approved roughly 280 PCR coronavirus tests, which determine whether sequences from the viruses’ RNA genome are present in a patient’s nasal swab.

However, such an effect of COVID-19 has not been reported. Furthermore, given that short segments of protein sequences are shared by syncytin-1 and the Spike proteins of common cold coronaviruses, a peak of infertility should be observed every winter, but this is not the case.\nIn summary, the similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the human placenta protein syncytin-1 are extremely small. Such similarities are present in many other proteins, but do not trigger broad autoimmune responses among COVID-19 patients. Similarities between syncytin-1 and the Spike protein of the common cold coronaviruses can also be detected, and yet no seasonal infertility is recorded, which would have been the case if brief identical sequences were sufficient to trigger immune cross-reactivity.\n“Covid Vaccine is Female Sterilization”; SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may trigger an immune response against the placenta. ... SOURCE: Anonymous, Health and Money News, 2 Dec. 2020  ... Factually Inaccurate: It is inaccurate to claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility or that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the human protein syncytin-1 are very similar.\nSyncitin-1 allows placenta cells to fuse together and is a crucial protein for the correct development of the placenta and a successful pregnancy. Therefore, when a woman gets vaccinated against COVID-19, her immune system would learn to detect the Spike protein contained in the vaccine but would also detect and attack the placenta protein syncytin-1, due to a phenomenon called cross-reactivity.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-12-15\nTitle: Fact check: A false post on social media claims COVID-19 vaccine ...\nContent:\nWe rate the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine causes female infertility as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The claim originates from a petition filed by Drs. Wolfgang Wodarg and Mike Yeadon, the latter an ex-employee of Pfizer who last worked with the company in 2011. The protein mentioned in the claim, syncytin-1, is important for placenta formation, but it bears no resemblance to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein save a very small amino acid sequence.\nAn image going viral on Facebook and elsewhere on social media is lodging a concerning complaint: The COVID-19 vaccine could lead to infertility in women. This comes as the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are delivered and administered across the USA. The image, a screenshot of what appears to be a news article, declares the vaccine is \"female sterilization,\" according to an unidentified Pfizer head of research. How exactly this is accomplished is through a protein contained in the vaccine, one integral for placenta formation.\nIf anti-SAR-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies produced by the mother were attacking syncytin-1, and thereby the placenta, pregnancy complications or miscarriages would prevail, said Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, to USA TODAY. So far, there has been no evidence of the kind reported among pregnant women. Fact check:US COVID-19 deaths from Dec. 1-5 rival the toll from the Pearl Harbor attack · We rate the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine causes female infertility as FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\nThe protein mentioned in the claim, syncytin-1, is important for placenta formation, but it bears no resemblance to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein save a very small amino acid sequence. Experts agree this similarity is not enough to trigger an immune response leading to female infertility. While the vaccine has not been tested in pregnant women, there are over 44,000 COVID-19 cases among pregnant women in the USA.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2022-03-14\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy: What to know if you're pregnant, ...\nContent:\nThere is also no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce your natural fertility or harm the placenta or fetus. While the COVID-19 vaccine is new, the mechanism of action of this mRNA vaccine and existing safety data provide reassurance regarding their safety.\nIt is therefore extremely unlikely that any of the mRNA would be able to get into breast milk or into the fetus through the placenta. Additionally, because it’s so easily degraded, it cannot survive the acidic environment of your baby’s stomach, so the vaccine itself cannot affect your baby. The vaccine is made up of mRNA, and contains no live virus.

People or bots or both have been asserting that syncitin-1, a protein that helps keep the placenta attached to the uterus during pregnancy, is very similar to the SARS-CoV2 spike proteins.

Let’s talk about whether this claim holds water. As we’ve established, the SCT supports the overall structure of the placental villi and has many important roles in supporting a pregnancy.\nThis sequence is too short for the immune system to meaningfully confuse it with placental proteins. It’s sort of like saying that you are going to be confused with a criminal because you wear a commonly sold red bracelet that was also found on the criminal. It’s not realistic. If this were true, we would also expect COVID-19 to cause early pregnancy loss a significant amount of the time.\nThe thing is, there is already excellent reason to doubt this is a reasonable claim, and that’s because of COVID-19. While COVID-19 seems to be a more severe disease in pregnancy, there is no evidence right now of an increase in early pregnancy losses, as might be expected if there were an aberrant immune response directed against placental antigens. As Cosma et al write:\n\nInformation 1, published on December 10, 2020, explains that there is no risk of infertility from COVID-19 vaccines. The claim that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the human protein syncytin-1 are very similar is factually inaccurate. The similarities between the two proteins are minimal, and such similarities do not trigger broad autoimmune responses among COVID-19 patients.

They were negative. She also said that no antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus had been found. The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.

The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported that 88,521 new coronavirus cases were recorded Thursday in the United States -- the most in a single day since the start of the pandemic.\nThese grim numbers hit as more superspreader events are reported, driven by political rallies and social occasions like weddings. CNN tracked the coronavirus rates in 17 counties where President Donald Trump held rallies between Aug. 17 and Sept. 26, and it found 14 counties had increased infection rates a month after the rallies. CNN said it evaluated the rate of new daily cases per 100,000 residents 4 weeks before the rally, on the rally date, and 4 weeks after the rally.\nFour weeks after the rally, the rate of new cases had risen 225%, CNN said. Photos and videos at the president’s rallies often show crowds of supporters largely without masks, a trend that runs contrary to national attitudes, a recent survey found. The CDC said this week that 89% of U.S. adults in June said they were dutifully wearing masks, compared to 78% in April.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-08-24\nTitle: Superspreaders drive the largest outbreaks of hospital onset COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nFor patients, symptom onset dates were collected by retrospective review of patients’ electronic hospital records (EPIC Systems), usually noted at presentation by the clerking doctor but all records were examined for any suggestion of symptoms.

Yet, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters, such as age, sex, and health conditions, are not clearly driving the superspreading phenomenon.\nDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is marked by cluster transmission phenotypes in which 80% of new infections are driven by <20% of infected individuals [1., 2., 3., 4.]. In contrast, influenza virus transmission is likely less cluster driven, with a more uniform transmission trajectory. Detailed contact tracing of influenza infections is not routinely conducted, complicating similar analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.\nRelease of virus-laden aerosols in a large-size range contributes to both close-up and long-range transmission [11,58]. At close contact all modes of transmission are possible and transmission is highly efficient. Close-contact transmission likely accounts for linear secondary transmission events (Figure 1, gray circles), although not all infections will result in a secondary infection. However, in suprespreader events long-range transmission is likely to mediate a large proportion of the cases.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Superspreading drives the COVID pandemic — and could help to tame it\nContent:\nLau, M.

Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia.\nIt's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.\nChina has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear.

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020–February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1).

Researchers from the Qualcomm Institute at the University of California San Diego analyzed Google Trends dating back 16 years and found that people searched for severe anxiety-related information at record highs beginning in March when the coronavirus pandemic was first declared a national emergency.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-09-27, is an article about a study that found a significant increase in Google searches for anxiety symptoms during the pandemic in the United States. The research, published in the journal Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, highlights the burden the COVID-19 pandemic has placed not only on people's physical health but also their mental health. The study found that search terms related to 'worry' increased significantly after the announcement of the pandemic, followed by a spike in searches for anxiety symptoms.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not available, is about a Tulane University study that used Google search data to examine trends in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a major jump in searches related to anxiety, panic attacks, and treatments for panic attacks, especially remote and self-care techniques, in the weeks following the pandemic declaration. The study was led by Michael Hoerger, an assistant professor of psychology in the Tulane School of Science and Engineering, and published in the journal Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is about the findings of a Google Trends analysis that suggests an immediate uptick in worry and panic, followed by the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis is based on Google Trends data, which allows individuals to examine longitudinal population-level variation in the relative frequency with which people use specific Google search terms.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-10-07, is about a study that assessed trends in reported anxiety and depression among U.S. adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia during August 19, 2020–June 7, 2021. The study found significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is about a study that analyzed Google Trends dating back 16 years and found that people searched for severe anxiety-related information at record highs beginning in March when the coronavirus pandemic was first declared a national emergency.\n\nClaim Summary:\nThe claim, published on 2020-09-27, states that anxiety symptoms increased during the pandemic, and Google Trends show this.\n\nClaim Veracity:\nThe claim is TRUE. The information provided supports the claim that anxiety symptoms increased during the pandemic, as shown by Google Trends data.

However, the Ministry of Health recommended against doing autopsies on patients who clearly had the disease. The information also mentions that Covid-19 is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, not a bacteria, and that severe Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems.\n\nInformation 4, published on June 26, 2020, by AFP Fact Check, states that Italian doctors performed post-mortems on Covid-19 patients and found that the disease is actually disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombosis). However, it is not correct that patients have that and not Covid-19. The information also mentions that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems and that aspirin and apronax have been used to treat patients.\n\nInformation 5, published on May 24, 2020, by an unknown source, repeats the claim that COVID-19 is not a virus but a bacteria that causes death and blood clots. The information also states that the way to fight it is with \"antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants\", aspirin, indicating that this disease has been poorly treated.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim that Italy has discovered that COVID-19 is not a virus but a bacteria that causes death and blood clots is not accurate. According to various sources, including Reuters Fact Check, AP News, Full Fact, and AFP Fact Check, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nWhile it is true that Italy did perform post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19, the findings do not support the claim that COVID-19 is a bacteria. Instead, the findings suggest that severe Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems, which is consistent with what is known about the disease.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the claim that aspirin and apronax have been used to treat Covid-19 patients is not supported by the Italian Medicines Agency. The agency makes no mention of aspirin on its page about drugs being used outside of clinical trials to treat patients with Covid-19.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Italy has discovered that COVID-19 is not a virus but a bacteria that causes death and blood clots is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about how anxiety affects your body and the overlap of symptoms with COVID-19.\nPreliminary research suggests that COVID-19 can cause digestive symptoms including a loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. If you’re having a hard time determining if the tightness in your chest and shallow breathing are related to your increased anxiety or a potential sign of COVID-19, you’re not alone. Because we’re still learning about the coronavirus, we can’t know exactly what symptoms it causes for most people.\nAs things develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s one thing just about everybody has in common: A drastic increase in anxiety. Whether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically.\nWhether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically. You might find yourself breathing shallowly or ever experience flu-like aches. When we’re all on the look-out for potential COVID-19 symptoms — shortness of breath, cough and fever — those physical anxiety symptoms can ratchet your fear up even higher.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-12, describes the physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks and those of COVID-19. It explains that anxiety can cause chest pain and other physical symptoms, which might make a person worry that they have COVID-19. Information 2, published on 2020-11-09, also discusses the similarities between anxiety symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms, and provides advice on how to differentiate between the two. Information 3 is a study abstract that examines the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among those who receive a positive COVID-19 test. Information 4, from UW Medicine, explains the differences between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms, and recommends checking for fever and paying attention to racing thoughts and muscle tension. Information 5, published on 2020-03-25, discusses how anxiety can affect the body and cause symptoms that overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"What is the difference between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms?\" is true, as there are several resources available that provide information on how to differentiate between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms. These resources explain that while anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, COVID-19 is not currently associated with racing thoughts or muscle tension. Additionally, taking one's temperature and paying attention to one's thoughts and body can help determine whether symptoms are caused by anxiety or COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ...

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement.

Combatting the coronavirus pandemic required each one of us to do our part, change our habits and daily routines and make personal sacrifices. If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change. Though invisible, COVID-19 has been seen by most people as a “clear and present danger” to the entire world population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-18, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the coronavirus. It explains that there is no evidence to support this claim, and global warming does not occur quickly enough to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, discusses the importance of addressing climate change despite the ongoing pandemic. It highlights that a majority of people are more worried about climate change now than before the pandemic, and policymakers should enact bold reforms to mitigate its effects. It also emphasizes the need for a strategy to overcome short-termism and ensure a just transition.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, outlines the urgency of addressing climate change. It mentions that global temperatures are already 1° Celsius above preindustrial levels and could rise to above 3° Celsius by 2100 if emissions are not slowed down. It also highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on the world's poorest countries and the need for scalable new technologies and nature-based solutions.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5° F and highlights that we have the technology to do so.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-05, draws parallels between the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. It highlights the need for personal sacrifices and a change in habits to combat the climate crisis.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that we must back away from climate change efforts to protect ourselves from the coronavirus is false. There is no evidence to support the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the virus. In fact, addressing climate change is more important than ever, as highlighted in information 2, 3, and 5. The pandemic has shown that political will and personal sacrifices can lead to significant progress in addressing global threats.

Several widely shared letters by small groups of scientists from different countries pushed strongly in the direction of a natural origin, calling suggestions that COVID-19 emerged in a lab a conspiracy theory.\nChinese officials have consistently rejected not only the hypothesis that the virus originated at the Wuhan laboratory, but that it originated in China at all. Additionally, Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn’t leak from her laboratory. (In April 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health pulled funding for a research project on coronaviruses in which the Wuhan institute was a chief partner.) Meanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States.\nMeanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States. The accusations come amid tensions between Washington and Beijing. Throughout 2020, the Donald Trump administration repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic, adding further friction to a relationship already strained by a trade war and U.S. responses to China’s rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, among other issues.\nMany critics say Trump’s use of inflammatory rhetoric such as “China virus” and “kung flu” contributed to a rise in anti-Asian bias in the United States amid the pandemic. President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts.

There would have been approximately 80% fewer COVID-19 deaths in the United States by March 29, 2020, if the country had employed mandatory BCG vaccination since at least 2000, according to the new research.\nIn their analysis, the scientists also tried to account for other factors that could have affected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections.

Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not.

One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\". So what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter? It's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\nIt's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market.\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-21\nTitle: Fact check: Did coronavirus originate in a Chinese laboratory?\nContent:\nWe have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\" We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.\nOne of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China. Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab · More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say · The article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”\nThese sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.\nThis is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs.

Furthermore, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nWhile there is debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China, the consensus among scientific experts is that the virus has an animal origin. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade, and the lab is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that the virus escaped from the WIV.\n\nIt is important to note that the publication date of the claim is 2020-04-13, while the publication date of Information 3 is 2021-05-27. Therefore, the claim was made before the re-emergence of the Wuhan lab-leak theory in 2023.

What caught your eye about the Covid-19 spike protein?  · The spike protein really differentiates this coronavirus from previous ones. We know about the ones that cause SARS or MERS. It’s got these specific, unique sequences at the molecular level that allow it to bind to proteins on the cell surface.\nThis is still a hypothesis, but we think viruses able to trigger neuropilin 1 might be able to dig deeper into tissues without first having to replicate themselves in the upper layer of cells. That would be an amazing bypassing mechanism for a virus.  · Would that make it harder for the immune system to spot them too?  · Exactly. And it would eventually mean the virus spreads quicker. It would help to give it this broad tropism (ability to infect many different organs and tissues) we are seeing in Covid-19 compared to the coronavirus that caused SARS, which doesn’t have that furin cleavage site.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-01-20\nTitle: FALSE: COVID-19 vaccine infects the cells of the human body – ...\nContent:\nExplanation: <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>vaccines</strong> - Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna are mRNA based <strong>vaccines</strong>.

If a person is later exposed to the virus, antibodies and other parts of the immune system can recognize and attack the virus before it can infect healthy cells or cause illness. Traditional vaccines work by giving a person either viral proteins or an inactivated or weakened version of a virus that triggers an immune response. mRNA vaccines do not contain viral material.\nBy injecting cells with a synthetic mRNA that encodes a viral spike protein, an mRNA vaccine can direct human cells to make a viral spike protein and evoke an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the viral material.

According to the provided information, COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19 and do not infect human cells. Instead, they introduce protein subunits to the body, which the immune system recognizes as foreign and uses to build protection against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

What international law says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and “are particularly protective of civilian hospitals”, according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.\nArticle 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including “intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected”.\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are “military objectives”. Philip-Gay said that “if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used”, the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.\nOne: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque – those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-02\nTitle: What are the laws of war when a hospital is a war zone? | The Hill\nContent:\nAll wars are an effrontery to health, and the Israel-Hamas war is no exception. Caring for the wounded is a necessary part of waging war and hospitals are protected from the consequence of hostilities. Additionally, all medical personnel are considered non-combatants.\nAccording to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals can never be a military target. That hospitals should not be a military target seems uncontroversial, but a deeper question remains: when is a building a hospital and when is it not?\nHumanitarian law is pragmatic, however, and has an answer when attacks are launched from places assumed to be protected. A building ceases to be a hospital when it is used as a base to launch rockets. Under these circumstances, a building is transformed from “hospital” to “legitimate military target.” The distinctive emblem designating non-combatant status is the red cross, the reverse colors of the Swiss flag; launching only one rocket from the hospital parking lot is enough to change the meaning of a red cross on that building from “hospital” to “bullseye.”\nIf a decision is made to attack a hospital, international humanitarian law requires advanced warning to that hospital. If the hospital fails to heed the warning, the subsequent attack on that hospital must adhere to the principles of precaution and proportionality.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: Can Hospitals Be Military Targets? What International Law Says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva Conventions, adopted in the aftermath of World War II, form the core of international humanitarian law and \"are particularly protective of civilian hospitals\", according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon-3 university in southeast France. \"It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone.\nArticle 8 of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including \"intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected\".\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are \"military objectives\". Philip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target.\nPhilip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. But \"the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians\", she said. Even if the hospital is used for \"acts harmful to the enemy\", Philip-Gay said, the other party \"does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it\", citing the need under international law for the response to be \"proportionate\".\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: The protection of hospitals during armed conflicts: What the law ...\nContent:\nAccording to international humanitarian law (IHL), health establishments and units, including hospitals, should not be attacked. This protection extends to the wounded and sick as well as to medical staff and means of transport. The rule has few exceptions.\nThe protection provided to the wounded and sick would have little meaning if medical personnel, medical units and establishments (such as hospitals), and medical means of transport were subject to attack. Therefore, IHL extends specific protections to them; parties to a conflict must respect them while they are performing an exclusively medical function, and must not unduly interfere with their work so as to allow them to treat the wounded and sick.\nSpecific protection of medical establishments and units (including hospitals) is the general rule under IHL. Therefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\".\nTherefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\". In case of doubt as to whether medical units of establishments are used to commit an \"act harmful to the enemy\", they should be presumed not to be so used.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (no publication date): Customary IHL states that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law unless they lose their protective status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. If there is doubt about a hospital's status, it should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 2 (published 2023-11-17): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, if there is doubt, the hospital should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 3 (published 2023-11-02): Hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be a military target. However, if a hospital is used to launch rockets, it becomes a legitimate military target. Advanced warning must be given before attacking a hospital, and the attack must follow the principles of precaution and proportionality.\n\nInformation 4 (published 2023-11-16): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians, and the response must be proportionate.\n\nInformation 5 (published 2023-11-16): According to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals should not be attacked, and medical personnel, medical units, and means of transport should be respected. The protection of hospitals can only cease if they are used for harmful acts against the enemy, and in case of doubt, hospitals should be presumed not to be used for such acts.\n\nClaim Summary: An official decree was taken by the government stating that the military will have to help in hospitals.\n\nGiven the information available, the claim does not provide enough context to determine if it is true or false. However, the information provided does support the idea that hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be attacked unless they lose their protected status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. Therefore, if the government decree states that the military will be helping in hospitals, it is likely that the hospitals have not lost their protected status and are still considered protected civilian facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

The man in the video inhales and exhales through two different surgical masks, a cupped mask, a cloth mask, a mask with filter material and a respirator with a valve.\n“I am disappointed that a licensed physician would use smoke as an equivalent comparison,” said Hogue, although as noted above, Noel’s license has expired. Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in aerosols, said in an email: “I consider that video disinformation because they clearly don’t know what they are doing with that test.” · The effectiveness of masks in limiting the potential spread of coronavirus has been extensively documented.\nA YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free.

The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’\" But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19.

As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.

In the second general election of the year in November, Vox came third and increased its number of deputies from 24 to 52. It was the most-voted party in the Region of Murcia and the autonomous city of Ceuta. At the beginning of 2020, during the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Vox called for travel restrictions between China and Spain, and later between Italy and Spain, to safeguard against the \"Chinese virus\".\nVox's reduced presence in the Congress meant that it lost its ability to appeal the government's legislature to the Supreme Court; it had previously used this right to challenge Sánchez's legislation on transgender issues, euthanasia and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to Guillermo Fernández Vázquez, Vox's positions, which he described as \"economically anti-statist and neoliberal\" as well as \"morally authoritarian\", is similar to positions held by Jörg Haider's Freedom Party of Austria or Jean Marie Le Pen's National Front from the 1980s, thus likening the emergence of the party to an archaic stage of current radical right parties, more worried about the need to modernize their image than Vox; the latter's approach to cultural issues would be in line with old school Spanish nationalist parties, restricting the scope of \"culture\" to \"language and tradition\".\nVox (Spanish pronunciation: [boɣs]; Latin for 'voice'; often stylized in all caps) is a national conservative political party in Spain.

So why does the ‘Yan ...\nContent:\nOn September 14, an article was posted to Zenodo, an open-access site for sharing research papers, which claimed that genetic evidence showed that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was made in a lab, rather than emerging through natural spillover from animals. The 26-page paper, led by Chinese virologist Li-Meng Yan, a postdoctoral researcher who left Hong Kong University, has not undergone peer review and asserts that this evidence of genetic engineering has been “censored” in the scientific journals.\nFinding answers to the precise events that led to a spillover pandemic is a “needle in a haystack proposition,” says Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist from Columbia University, who co-authored an early research paper in Nature Medicine about the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. The Yan report claims this Nature Medicine report had a “conflict of interest” due to Lipkin’s work in containing the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, for which he received an award from the Chinese government.\nThe Yan report claims this Nature Medicine report had a “conflict of interest” due to Lipkin’s work in containing the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, for which he received an award from the Chinese government. Lipkin says this accusation is “absurd,” and when asked for his view on the role of bioengineering in the origins of SARS-CoV-2, he adds: “There is no data to support this.”\nAs such, they would be a poor starting point for bioengineering SARS-CoV-2. Engineering a virus in which you had to replace more than 10 percent of its genome is inefficient, if not impossible, according to Rasmussen and several other virologists. The fact that these strains were identified at a Chinese military lab is also “just circumstantial,” says Robertson. The bat coronaviruses were circulating in wild bats and could have been discovered by anyone. The report also argues that SARS-CoV-2 has “restriction-enzyme sites,” or genetic sequences that can be cut and manipulated by enzymes.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: News: Was the coronavirus made in a Wuhan...

Proponents of the lab leak hypothesis reacted by accusing the agencies of conspiring with the Chinese, or of being incompetent.\nThere is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic, or that any suspicious biosecurity incidents happened in any laboratory. Many scenarios proposed for a lab leak are characteristic of conspiracy theories. Central to many is the misplaced suspicion about the proximity of the outbreak to a virology institute that studies coronaviruses, the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Most large Chinese cities have laboratories that study coronaviruses, and virus outbreaks typically begin in rural areas, but are first noticed in large cities.\nProponents of the lab leak theory typically omit to mention that most large Chinese cities have coronavirus research laboratories. Virus outbreaks tend to begin in rural areas, but are first noticed in large cities. Stephan Lewandowsky and colleagues write than in itself, the location of the Institute is \"literally a coincidence\" and using it as a priori evidence for a lab leak typifies the kind of conjunction fallacy.

Nearly a third of the hundred and seventy-four earliest known cases were linked to Huanan. And yet, patient zero likely was not. Chinese officials have said he was a middle-aged accountant, surnamed Chen, who developed symptoms on December 8th, and typically shopped at a supermarket across the river.\nAccording to an unclassified summary of the investigation’s findings, released in August, the virus was not developed as a biological weapon, its sudden emergence caught Chinese officials off guard, and it infected humans no later than November, 2019, “with the first known cluster of COVID-19 cases arising in Wuhan, China, in December.” Otherwise, all agencies agreed that two origin hypotheses remained “plausible”: a “natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident.”\nBut a virologist at Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine had been, he wrote, “serendipitously” conducting monthly surveys to identify the source of a severe tick-borne disease. In June, he published a study containing documentary evidence that, in the two years prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, nearly fifty thousand live animals representing thirty-eight wild species—many of which are now known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2—were sold and butchered in Wuhan markets, including Huanan.\n\nInformation 1, published on an unknown date, discusses a report by Chinese virologist Li-Meng Yan claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a lab.

The information revealing the inaccuracy of this claim was published earlier (April 30, 2020) than the claim itself (May 20, 2020). Additionally, multiple sources confirm the non-existence of the US health department chief, J Anthony, who was attributed to the claim.\n\nThe claim's content is inconsistent with the information, as there is no evidence supporting the idea that hair salons are responsible for almost 50 percent of all coronavirus deaths. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misinformation, as hair salons are not a significant factor in the spread of the virus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Related COVID-19 pulmonary severity ascribed to coagulation differences · In multivariate analysis, longer anticoagulation duration was associated with a 14% lower adjusted risk of in-hospital death (hazard ratio, 0.86 per day; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.89; P < .001).\nBleeding events were similar in patients treated with and without anticoagulation (3% vs. 1.9%; P = .2) but were more common among the 375 intubated patients than among nonintubated patients (7.5% vs. 1.35%; P value not given). “The most important thing was there was no increase in bleeding,” said Dr. Fuster. Additional support for a possible survival benefit was published April 27 and included 449 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with heparin (mostly LMWH) for at least 7 days in Hunan, China.\nUse of systemic anticoagulation may improve the chance of survival in patients hospitalized with the COVID-19 virus, a large study from the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak suggests.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Antithrombotic Therapy | COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines\nContent:\nObservational studies and clinical trials have examined the effects of anticoagulation on mortality, progression of COVID-19, thrombosis, and bleeding. Some of these studies are outlined below. Observational studies are included here only when evidence from clinical trials is not available.\nThe multiplatform ATTACC/ACTIV-4a/REMAP-CAP trial compared the effectiveness of a therapeutic dose of heparin or LMWH with usual care in reducing the number of organ support-free days among critically ill patients with COVID-19.27 All 3 trials were stopped for futility. Heparin doses in the usual care arm varied. The median number of organ support-free days and likelihood of survival to hospital discharge did not differ between the arms. Major bleeding occurred in 4% of patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation and in 2% of patients who received usual care. Therapeutic doses of heparin showed no significant benefit for patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU.\nThe FREEDOM trial is the only study that evaluated the use of therapeutic apixaban in patients with COVID-19; in contrast, 4 trials have evaluated the use of therapeutic heparin. Additionally, oral anticoagulants have the potential for drug-drug interactions and present unique challenges for managing hemorrhages. Due to these limitations, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of a therapeutic dose of apixaban for VTE prophylaxis or the prevention of COVID-19 progression.\nBecause pregnant patients were not included in most of the clinical trials that evaluated the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in the setting of COVID-19, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in pregnant patients with COVID-19 who do not have evidence of VTE.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-13\nTitle: Anticoagulation in COVID-19: current concepts and controversies ...\nContent:\nThe ongoing randomised control trials (RCTs) are yet to provide concrete evidence on definitive role of anticoagulation in COVID-19, though results are promising.

Ackermann et al examined seven lung samples from patients died of severe COVID-19 and found that, apart from the diffuse alveolar damage and perivascular T-cell infiltration, there was severe endothelial damage and enhanced angiogenesis along with widespread thrombosis in pulmonary vasculature.43\nHowever, as all the patients with COVID-19 are not routinely screened for PE, therefore the reported incidence and mortality secondary to it, may differ from the reported figures. The ongoing randomised control trials (RCTs) are yet to provide concrete evidence on definitive role of anticoagulation in COVID-19, though results are promising.\nRoutine administration of oral anticoagulants in all patients with COVID-19 at the time of discharge is not recommended.

The study found that median survival increased from 14 days to 21 days with the addition of anticoagulation, and in-hospital mortality was similar in patients treated with and without anticoagulation (22.5% vs. 22.8%). However, longer anticoagulation duration was associated with a lower adjusted risk of in-hospital death. Bleeding events were similar in patients treated with and without anticoagulation.\n\nInformation 3 provides details of the Antithrombotic Therapy section of the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. The guidelines cite observational studies and clinical trials that have examined the effects of anticoagulation on mortality, progression of COVID-19, thrombosis, and bleeding. The multiplatform ATTACC/ACTIV-4a/REMAP-CAP trial compared the effectiveness of a therapeutic dose of heparin or LMWH with usual care in reducing the number of organ support-free days among critically ill patients with COVID-19. The trial found that therapeutic doses of heparin showed no significant benefit for patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU.\n\nInformation 4 provides an overview of the current concepts and controversies related to anticoagulation in COVID-19. The article states that the ongoing randomized control trials (RCTs) are yet to provide concrete evidence on the definitive role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. The incidence of thromboembolism (TE) has been reported to be as high as 70% in some studies, and autopsy studies have shown severe endothelial damage and widespread thrombosis in pulmonary vasculature. However, the article also states that routine administration of oral anticoagulants in all patients with COVID-19 at the time of discharge is not recommended.\n\nBased on the above information, the claim that \"evidence builds linking anticoagulation to COVID-19 survival\" is partially true. While some studies, such as the one conducted at Mount Sinai Health System, suggest that the use of systemic anticoagulation may improve the chance of survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, other studies and guidelines, such as the multiplatform ATTACC/ACTIV-4a/REMAP-CAP trial and the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, suggest that therapeutic doses of heparin showed no significant benefit for patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU. Furthermore, the ongoing RCTs are yet to provide concrete evidence on the definitive role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. Therefore, while anticoagulation may be beneficial in some cases, more research is needed to determine its overall effectiveness in treating COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24]. Vitamin C has many properties that make it a valuable therapeutic agent for respiratory infections.\nThis may provide timely data on the possible preventive and therapeutic values of vitamin C for medical and public interest in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Some say it goes against America’s history of being welcome to immigrants. Others want it to signal that people without authorization are not welcome. But Mr. Trump identified himself so closely with the wall that it became more politically charged than ever, and still represents a key part of Republican lawmakers’ strategy to secure the border.\nTrump reprogrammed to build a wall. Mr. Biden halted the use of the reprogrammed defense funds on his first day in office. Border Patrol agents have made more than two million arrests at the southwest border this year. Some 245,000 of those were in the Rio Grande Valley, according to government data.\nIn all, according to the Government Accountability Office, only 87 miles of new barriers were added.

Other media outlets quickly followed suit, publishing stories about Godinho’s death alongside images of the child, including the photo used in the social media posts.\nThe post reads, “CHILD DIES IN 3 COUNTRIES OF CORONA VIRUS.” Similar claims involving the same child’s photo have also appeared on Twitter. The content of the post, which has been widely shared across social media, is misleading on several points. The child pictured in the post is Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a Portuguese boy who died at age 14 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.\nRather, Godinho’s photo was included in the story in reference to other young people who had died of COVID-19 in Europe, and it accurately identifies the photo as that of Godinho. Prior to the passing of the unnamed Belgian girl, Godinho was believed to be “Europe’s youngest coronavirus victim.” There are no pictures of the Belgian girl in the Daily Express article or any other article we were able to find. The social media post also claims that Godinho’s image is being used in the news report of a 13-year-old boy in the UK, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died from the coronavirus.\nSocial media posts falsely suggest that news outlets are misusing a boy’s image to report the same child died of COVID-19 in three different countries. The posts actually refer to three different young people who died from the novel coronavirus in Portugal, Belgium and the UK.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: PolitiFact | Doctored images in coronavirus post exploit boy’s ...\nContent:\nen.as.com, \"Coronavirus: 13-year-old boy dies of coronavirus in the UK,\" April 1, 2020 · AFP Fact Check, \"This photo has circulated in reports about an Irish teenager who died in 2017,\" April 8, 2020 · Lead Stories, \"Fact Check: Photo On Biography Of Boy Who Died From Coronavirus Is NOT Actually Him,\" April 6, 2020\nStirring new grief for the family of a boy who committed suicide in 2017, people are sharing doctored images of the child in an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the coronavirus pandemic. \"Same little boy died of COVID-19 in three different countries,\" a Facebook post says facetiously. \"Still don’t believe the media is #fakenews?\" The post, which contains three screenshots of what appear to be portions of three different news reports, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The Commission is given five sessions to discuss the proposal.\nMoreover, 13 parties expressed the intention to introduce modifications to the proposal regarding rural pensions, benefits to disabled people, and underprivileged elders. ... The House's Special Committee begins analyzing the merits of the proposed bill. There will be 11 public hearings with about 60 guests to discuss the topic of social security and the proposed reform. The committee's chairman, Marcelo Ramos, says he will work to approve the bill and deliver its analysis to the House plenary by July. Polling by the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (CNI) indicates that the amount of people who believe pension reform to be necessary increased to 72 percent in 2019, from 65 percent in 2015.\nThe government predicts R$800 billion ($197 billion) in savings over the next decade as a result of the reform, down from the R$1.2 trillion ($290 billion) projected by Guedes’ economic team in February of this year. The amount received will depend on the years of contribution, with those working the minimum—15 years for women and 20 for men—receiving 60 percent of median salary; and those who work the maximum—40 years for women and 45 for men—receiving 110 percent.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-05-27\nTitle: Brazil government aide says COVID-19's toll on elderly will reduce ...\nContent:\nA top epidemiologist <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong> told Reuters there was &quot;pressure&quot; from President Jair Bolsanaro&#x27;s chief-of-staff&#x27;s office to water down coronavirus restrictions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The challenges of ageism in Brazil - PMC\nContent:\nMany government regulations and programs are established with a particular age group in mind and they thus inadvertently discriminate against persons in other age groups. Job retraining programs are cited as a good example of this type of discrimination because they are generally targeted toward people of \"employable\" ages or of specific gender, racial, or disability statuses (Sampaio, 1999). Brazilian social policies that target the elderly, children, youth and women in reproductive ages may be viewed as ageist policies.\nTherefore this article aims to convey, first, that ageism in Brazil is mainly associated with elderly people and it is a central issue of the debate on intergenerational exchanges and allocation of governmental resources. Second, age discrimination should be combated with educational programs, government intervention and even new legislation.\nTherefore, the increase in benefits and in the participation of the elderly in the labor force as well as the greater public awareness of the dispute for resources between age groups, becomes a plausible explanation for the doubling of Brazilians supporting the idea that older people should be forced to retire from work early when jobs are scarce. Finally, during the 1990s, government efforts at reducing social inequalities among older persons resulted in the National Council of the Rights of Older Persons, which organized conferences, public hearings, and workshops to foster participation.\nSecond, age discrimination should be combated with educational programs, government intervention and even new legislation. Facing the traditional tension between scholarship and activism, we conclude with recommendations to identify and address age discrimination and ageism in the context of current anti-discriminatory policies in Brazil. The “clash of generations” in Brazil whether actual or perceived, real or invented, has come to the centre of policy discussions about the elderly population as well as into popular awareness through the mass media (Goldani, 2005).\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: This is about the pension reform in Brazil, which was proposed by the government to amend the constitution and combat the deficit in the pension system. The proposal was approved in 2019, and it established the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement. The constitution requires an absolute majority in both houses for amendment approval.\n\nInformation 2: This is about the international social security agreements between Canada and Brazil. The agreement covers Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan benefits only. If a person has lived or worked in both countries, they may be eligible for pensions or benefits from both countries.\n\nInformation 3: This is about the progress of pension reform in Brazil. The Lower House set up a committee to analyze the government's proposal to overhaul the pension system. The committee had five sessions to discuss the proposal, and there were 11 public hearings with about 60 guests. The government predicted R$800 billion ($197 billion) in savings over the next decade as a result of the reform.\n\nInformation 4: This is about the pressure from President Jair Bolsonaro's chief-of-staff's office to water down coronavirus restrictions.\n\nInformation 5: This is about ageism in Brazil, mainly associated with elderly people. Age discrimination should be combated with educational programs, government intervention, and new legislation. Government efforts have been made to reduce social inequalities among older persons.\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that \"Elderly people who are caught wandering outside in Brazil will have their pensions canceled by the government\" is false.

Two groups of researchers aim to find out. One clinical trial, from doctors at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, will try to determine whether \"convalescent plasma\" injected into hospitalized COVID-19 patients can protect them from developing severe disease or requiring a ventilator.\nCOVID-19 survivor Domenico Piccininni, 50, donated his plasma in late April at Atlanta's Northside Hospital. He hopes his antibodies can help kick-start the immune systems of people made very ill by coronavirus. \"My wife volunteered me,\" he said, laughing. \"I've never even donated blood before.\nThe two main ones are the patient catching an infectious disease, though blood screening helps to lessen that possibility, or a patient's immune system reacting badly to the injected plasma of another person.

The idea of using plasma from survivors, also known as convalescent-plasma therapy, dates back to the late 19th century.

Given the dearth of treatments for COVID-19, convalescent plasma has gained new prominence.\nGiven the dearth of treatments for COVID-19, convalescent plasma has gained new prominence. The blood of survivors, the thinking goes, contains proteins called antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus. Early data from very small numbers of COVID-19 patients in China show some promise.\nSo doctors, scientists, blood banks, and government agencies have begun mobilizing to collect, distribute, and study plasma from COVID-19 survivors. The advantage of plasma is that you don’t need to develop a vaccine or treatment from scratch. But in these early days of the pandemic, when the number of recovered and confirmed patients is still relatively small, finding them will take time.\nThey should have had a lab test confirming COVID-19, which is hard to get now and was even harder to get when the donors would have first gotten sick, several weeks ago.

Measles and tuberculosis are examples of respiratory diseases that remain infectious in the air for long time periods.\nThe researchers estimate that in most real-world situations, the virus would remain suspended in the air for about 30 minutes, before settling onto surfaces. This is similar to what was found for SARS and MERS, which some researchers consider likely to be spread via airborne transmission.\nIt is also very important to stay as far away from one another as possible, minimum 6 feet. The farther, the better. Some experts recommend staying at least 25 feet away from others, even when outdoors. And it's a good idea to avoid crowded indoor spaces. The traditional definition of airborne transmission is that small droplets containing a pathogen remaining viable over long time periods travel long distances in the air and infect other people when the pathogen is breathed in.\nOutside, the circulation of fresh air disperses the drifting droplets quickly, and so the combination of wearing face coverings and maintaining physical distance (6 feet or more) is very effective at impeding the spread of COVID-19 in outdoor spaces where air moves. However, in indoor spaces, especially those with poor ventilation, coronavirus-laden droplets can build up to a level that is risky.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-02-11\nTitle: COVID-19 Overview and Infection Prevention and Control Priorities ...\nContent:\nCurrent WHO guidance for healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions in addition to standard precautions unless an aerosol generated procedure is being performed, in which case airborne precautions are needed.1 Disposable or dedicated patient care equipment, such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, should be used.\nAll of these preventative measures are important to protect individuals from acquiring and transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and should be done in conjunction with one another. Getting vaccinated is a preventative measure that people can take to avoid getting sick with COVID-19 and to avoid infecting others.\nInfection prevention and control information for non-US healthcare settings and non-US national government officials working on COVID-19 response.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-29\nTitle: Modes of transmission of virus causing COVID-19: implications for ...\nContent:\nRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7 · Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.  · In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nTo date, some scientific publications provide initial evidence on whether the COVID-19 virus can be detected in the air and thus, some news outlets have suggested that there has been airborne transmission. These initial findings need to be interpreted carefully. A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine has evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus.10 In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions.\nAs evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play in transmission.  · Based on the available evidence, including the recent publications mentioned above, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. WHO continues to recommend airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures and support treatment are performed, according to risk assessment.13 These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine14 and those currently used in Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom.15-17\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that the coronavirus can be transmitted through short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission, as well as through droplet transmission when infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. It also mentions that aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance, which is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission. This information suggests that the coronavirus can be transmitted through the air, both in the form of aerosols and droplets.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, states that the particles of the coronavirus can linger in the air after a person has left the room and can remain airborne for hours in some cases. It also mentions that activities that increase emission of respiratory fluids, such as speaking loudly, singing, or exercising, can increase the potential for airborne transmission. This information further supports the idea that the coronavirus can be transmitted through the air.\n\nInformation 3, does not have a publication date, but it aligns with the other sources in stating that the virus can be transmitted through the air and that staying at least 6 feet away from others, avoiding crowded indoor spaces, and wearing face coverings can help reduce the potential for airborne transmission.\n\nInformation 4, published before the claim, states that the WHO guidance for healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions in addition to standard precautions unless an aerosol generated procedure is being performed, in which case airborne precautions are needed.\n\nInformation 5, published before the claim, states that COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes and that airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed.\n\nIn summary, all the information provided supports the claim that the coronavirus can be transmitted through the air, both in the form of aerosols and droplets. The information also suggests that specific precautions, such as wearing face coverings, avoiding crowded indoor spaces, and using airborne precautions when performing aerosol generating procedures, can help reduce the potential for airborne transmission.\n\nIt is important to note that the claim is published on May 4, 2020, and the information provided is published before or on that date.

They discuss a review of the long-term effects of COVID-19, referred to as \"Long Covid.\" The review is led by Dr. Elaine Maxwell of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The key findings of the review include:\n\n1. Long Covid may consist of four different syndromes, which can affect various body systems, including respiratory, heart, urinary, brain, skin, gut, and muscle and joint systems.\n2. These syndromes can occur in people with varying severity of initial COVID-19 infection, from mild to severe cases.\n3. The four syndromes include post-intensive care syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome, permanent organ damage, and long-term COVID syndrome. Some patients may experience one or more syndromes simultaneously.\n4. The lack of distinction between these syndromes may contribute to challenges faced by patients in being believed and accessing appropriate healthcare services.\n5. The ongoing after-effects of COVID-19 may not be a single illness but rather a combination of these four syndromes.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nGiven the information provided, the claim is accurate.

Consistent use of a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio = 0.44).\nThe use of face masks or respirators (N95/KN95) is recommended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Well-fitting face masks and respirators effectively filter virus-sized particles in laboratory conditions (2,3), though few studies have assessed their real-world effectiveness in preventing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4).\nFace mask or respirator use was assessed among 652 case-participants (residents who had received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2) and 1,176 matched control-participants (residents who had received negative test results for SARS-CoV-2) who self-reported being in indoor public settings during the 2 weeks preceding testing and who reported no known contact with anyone with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection during this time.

Wearing face masks has been widely advocated to mitigate transmission. Masks are thought to protect people in two ways: (i) source control, reducing the emission and spread of respiratory viruses through airborne droplets and aerosols, and (ii) wearer protection, reducing the inhalation of airborne respiratory viruses. The effectiveness of masks, however, is still under debate. Compared with N95 or FFP2 respirators, which have very low particle penetration rates (~5%), surgical and similar masks exhibit higher and more variable penetration rates (~30 to 70%) (2, 3).\nFace masks are highly effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission because, in most environments, airborne virus abundance is limited.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How effective is a mask in preventing COVID‐19 infection? - PMC\nContent:\nN95 masks are one of the most common air filtering respirators which are currently in high demand during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Terms searched were “face masks”, “surgical mask” and “N95” in combination with the terms “risk” and “adverse effects” as well as “side effects”. The selection criteria of the papers were based on our above definition of risk and adverse effect of masks.\nIn a laboratory experiment (evidence level IIa study), it was demonstrated that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses using virus-free aerosols [118]. In this study, the FFP2-equivalent N95 mask performed significantly better in protection (8–12 times more effective) than the surgical mask, but neither mask type established reliable, hypothesis-generated protection against corona and influenza viruses. Both mask types could be penetrated unhindered by aerosol particles with a diameter of 0.08 to 0.2 μm. Both the SARS-CoV-2 pathogens with a size of 0.06 to 0.14 μm [119] and the influenza viruses with 0.08 to 0.12 μm are unfortunately well below the mask pore sizes [118].\nKeywords: personal protective equipment, masks, N95 face mask, surgical mask, risk, adverse effects, long-term adverse effects, contraindications, health risk assessment, hypercapnia, hypoxia, headache, dyspnea, physical exertion, MIES syndrome · At the beginning of the spread of the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2, it was necessary to make far-reaching decisions even without available explicit scientific data.\nAt least Germany pointed out that wearers of certain types of masks such as the common fabric masks (community masks) cannot rely on them to protect them or others from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [114]. However, scientists not only complain about the lack of evidence for fabric masks in the scope of a pandemic [16,110], but also about the high permeability of fabric masks with particles and the potential risk of infection they pose [108,109]. Ordinary fabric masks with a 97% penetration for particle dimensions of ≥0.3 μm are in stark contrast to medical-type surgical masks with a 44% penetration. In contrast, the N95 mask has a penetration rate of less than 0.01% for particles ≥ 0.3 μm in the laboratory experiment [108,115].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: An evidence review of face masks against COVID-19 | Proceedings ...\nContent:\nMa et al., Exhaled breath is a significant source of SARS-CoV-2 emission. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20115154 (2 June 2020). ...

The studies and information presented show that N95 masks are effective in filtering virus-sized particles and reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is no evidence to support the claim that the lack of oxygen from using N95 masks causes severe respiratory problems. In fact, Information 4 states that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, but it does not support the claim that N95 masks are ineffective in restricting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, Information 1 specifically found that consistent use of N95 masks in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Not only is COVID-19 deadlier than the flu, but symptoms can be long-lasting, according to medical experts.\nHodkinson’s claim that masks are “useless” is false. Studies show that masks work to slow the spread of the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has long advised people to wear masks. In November, the CDC said that masks can also protect wearers who are not infected. His false comments were recorded, posted on YouTube and then spread on social media. “Top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson told Canadian government officials in Alberta during a phone conference that the coronavirus pandemic is ‘the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public,’” stated an Instagram post that shared the false claims.\n“This [COVID-19] is very different from influenza, much higher mortality, much higher morbidity if you survive it,” said Dr. Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, a professor of infectious diseases at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. “There’s no sort of long-lasting effects of influenza either. It’s a completely wrong assertion.” · Hodkinson’s claim that masks are “useless” is false.\nHodkinson called COVID-19 just “another bad flu” and said “masks were utterly useless,” also claiming that “there is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever.”\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-10\nTitle: Canadian doctor falsely claims pandemic is a ‘hoax’ | Fact Check\nContent:\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked false claims about the mortality rates of Covid-19 compared to those of the flu, and confirmed that Covid-19 and flu are tracked and reported separately in Canada. Claim 2: “Masks are utterly useless, there is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever,” Hodkinson also claimed, before adding that “social distancing is also useless because Covid is spread by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing.”\nThe Alberta Health Ministry “respects Dr Hodkinson’s credentials as a physician but disagrees with his assessment of Covid-19 and is not taking advice from him in regard to the government’s response to the pandemic,” Steve Buick, a spokesman for the Minister of Health, told AFP in an email. He added that the Minister and government “continue to rely on the advice of Dr Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health.” · Alberta Health Services, the provincial health care system, tweeted that Hodkinson “has no formal affiliation” with the health authorities and urged people to follow provincial guidelines instead.\nSidhu, who leads the Covid-19 study in Calgary, refutes Hodkinson’s claim about masks. “That would make sense if the virus particles weren’t also attached to water droplets which is actually what is caught in most masks, preventing spread of the disease,” he said.\nClaim 3: “Positive test results do not… mean a clinical infection, it’s simply driving public hysteria and all testing should stop unless you’re presenting to hospital with some respiratory problems,” claimed Hodkinson, who said he is chairman of a North Carolina company selling Covid-19 tests.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-11-23\nTitle: Did Dr. Roger Hodkinson Call COVID-19 a Hoax? | Snopes.com\nContent:\nThere is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.

The 2009 H1N1 virus is not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal flu vaccine because it was identified after manufacturers had started making the seasonal flu vaccine.\nPersons who have some antibody from previous vaccination or exposure to infection with another related flu strain will have much greater increases in antibody to flu vaccines. Studies that looked at blood samples taken from children before the pandemic indicate that very few children had any measurable immunity against 2009 H1N1 prior to the outbreak Therefore, all children younger than 10 should get 2 doses regardless of whether they ever have been given seasonal influenza vaccine\nSo, increased activity from either seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 or both are still possible this season.

It was phase III clinically trialled in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey and relies on traditional technology similar to other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, another Chinese vaccine, and Covaxin, an Indian vaccine.\nCoronaVac is being used in vaccination campaigns in various countries in Asia, South America, Central America, and Eastern Europe. By April 2021, Sinovac had a production capacity of 2 billion doses per year. It is currently being manufactured at several facilities in China, with overseas manufacture planned for Brazil in September 2021 and eventually Egypt and Hungary.\nIn July 2020, Sinovac began Phase III trials to evaluate efficacy and safety on 9,000 volunteer healthcare professionals in Brazil, collaborating with Butantan Institute. On 19 October, São Paulo Governor João Doria said the first results of the clinical study conducted in Brazil proved that among the vaccines being tested in the country, CoronaVac is the safest, the one with the best and most promising immunization rates.\nIn early January 2021, Brazilian health officials announced that the vaccine had an efficacy of 78%. One week later, they revised this figure to 50.4%, stating that the revised figure now included \"very mild\" cases of COVID-19 among trial participants which were omitted in the earlier analysis. Ricardo Palácios, medical director of Brazil's Instituto Butantan, said Sinovac's relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to more rigorous standards for what counted as an infection among trial participants.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-03-08\nTitle: Exclusive: Study in Brazil indicates Sinovac vaccine works against ...\nContent:\nPreliminary data from a study <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong> indicates that the COVID-19 <strong>vaccine</strong> developed by China&#x27;s <strong>Sinovac</strong> Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong>, a source familiar with the study told Reuters on Monday.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a date, is about a city in Brazil using the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains the CDC's H1N1 flu vaccine, including its name and the fact that it doesn't indicate how long the vaccine will work or the year it should be administered.

It wasn’t. There are many human coronaviruses, and these products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-02-27, mentions multiple videos on Facebook claiming that information labels on Lysol disinfectant products prove that the \"human coronavirus\" is not a new phenomenon. The labeling does not refer to the current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) specifically, but rather to other strains of the human coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, without a specific publication date, discusses a Facebook post that claims a Clorox bottle could kill the 2019 coronavirus before it was discovered.

The disinfectant gel in question was likely tested against a strain of the human coronavirus that causes the common cold, not the specific SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the current pandemic. Additionally, the US EPA's List N, published on 2020-03-13, includes disinfectants that are expected to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus when used according to the label directions, indicating that these products were not specifically tested against the virus before 2019.", "response": "FALSE."}

The fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode.\nIf you're carrying alcohol-based hand sanitizer wherever you go, congratulations—it's what we've been advised to do by public-health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic. However, don't leave it inside your car, because the very alcohol that helps kill germs is also very flammable.\nThe fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode. Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid \"which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-05-28\nTitle: Can hand sanitiser catch fire in a hot car? - Full Fact\nContent:\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363°C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side. So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak.

We interviewed 35 individuals from a subsample of 1,599 survey respondents 18 years and older in the Philippines. The interviews were conducted in Filipino, Cebuano, and/or English via online platforms such as Zoom or via phone call. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and analysed using inductive content analysis. To highlight the complex reasons for delaying and/or refusing COVID-19 vaccines, we embedded our findings within the social ecological model.\nAs early as the first phase of the pandemic, critical care capacity was overwhelmed with the influx of patients in hospitals [10, 11]. As of 16 September 2021, the Philippines ranks third among countries with the highest number of newly confirmed cases per one million population [1, 20]. Globally, 42.9% of the world population have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with much lower rates in LMICs like the Philippines [20, 21]. Only 55% of Filipinos have expressed willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and as of 16 September 2021, only 30% of the population have been fully vaccinated[21, 22].\nRecognising the multiple dimensions in which behaviours and decisions occur, theories and models have been proposed to explain how individuals make decisions on their health based on factors that change over time and context [25, 26]. The social ecological model provides a useful framework for investigating health behaviours and decisions by recognising that a multiplicity of factors interacts to influence health of individuals [26]. These include individual factors representing biological or behavioural characteristics, interpersonal factors representing networks and social capital operating within a defined boundary, and structural factors that include health systems and are mediated through laws and policies [26]. Published studies on vaccination that utilised this model reported that vaccine intentions and attitudes operate along multiple dimensions, with a series of events influencing decisions related to vaccination [17, 27, 28].

The continued controversy surrounding Denvgaxia during the COVID‐19 pandemic is likely further eroding vaccine confidence, as lingering governance issues continue to erode trust in the government.\nUnsurprisingly, a nationally representative survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS), a private non‐profit polling body, conducted in September 2020 revealed that about one‐third of Filipinos demonstrate vaccine hesitancy when asked about Dengvaxia. 22 Another survey by SWS from April to May 2021, showed that a similar share of Filipinos demonstrates hesitancy against any COVID‐19 vaccine.

(There were differences among the vaccines, with Moderna’s primary series of two shots showing the highest effectiveness of 62% one month after the series, and Sinovac’s demonstrating the lowest effectiveness at 32%.) After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. FACT: Vaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected.

However, now the first evidence is emerging · On 1 April, Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time. The studies did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-09-27, explains how vaccines work and debunks myths about COVID-19 vaccines. It states that vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection against the disease without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track movement and do not contain microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, or nanowire semiconductors.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2023-09-22, provides further details on how COVID-19 vaccines work. Protein subunit vaccines contain pieces of the virus that causes COVID-19, and an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to the spike protein. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, it will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect against COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-12-13, explains how COVID-19 immunity works at this point in the pandemic. Antibodies produced after an infection or vaccination wane after a few months. Immunization is the most effective way to launch antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, states that it is too soon to say exactly how long COVID-19 vaccines will protect people for, but there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity can last for up to eight months, and vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting.\n\nClaim: The immunity produced by the COVID-19 vaccine only works for six months.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is mostly false.

By mid-March, institutions in hotspot areas began postponing or canceling elective cases to preserve resources and reduce risk of transmission.1 Currently, hospitals are only performing the most urgent cases.\nClosing operating rooms as part of real-time, day-to-day management of the COVID-19 crisis is appropriate and rational. However, by committing to this course of action, we have elected to delay surgical care for those who need it, to conserve resources for the pandemic. Estimates place the total number of US deaths from coronavirus in the tens to hundreds of thousands, but the indirect effects of delayed or deferred care must also be counted in the final tally.\nMedical centers will have to account for the loss of revenue from delaying or canceling elective surgery. Hospitals will also likely face changes in insurer and payer mix, with greater numbers of newly uninsured and publicly insured patients, which will in turn affect already strained hospital financial accounts. As a result of the crisis, 3 in 10 Americans have lost their jobs, been laid off, or had their hours reduced without pay.8 Many will also lose their health insurance, a known determinant of access to surgical care and associated with worse surgical outcomes.9 Certain socioeconomic groups are already disadvantaged with regards to receipt of timely surgical treatment.10 COVID will undoubtedly exacerbate the challenges these vulnerable groups face.\nHowever, by committing to this course of action, we have elected to delay surgical care for those who need it, to conserve resources for the pandemic.

From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered.

Further, while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report, our internal guidelines emphasized early intubation and standard lung-protective ventilation strategies. Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual patient risk factors, clinical interventions and treatments, and health system factors that can improve mortality in the face of this global pandemic.\nThese data indicate that a majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can have good clinical outcomes and support the ongoing use of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure. In some of the earliest reports of COVID-19 from Wuhan, mortality rates among those admitted to ICUs ranged from 52–62%, and increased to 86–97% among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.5,6,15,16 In more recent data from the United Kingdom, 67% of those who had received mechanical ventilation died, as compared to 22% of patients intubated with viral pneumonia in the preceding three years.3 Early reports of smaller cohorts from Seattle, where some of the first COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in the United States, indicated that 50–67% of patients admitted to the ICU and 71–75% of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation died.1,2 A recently published report from New York also found high mortality of 88.1% among those who required mechanical ventilation.4\nDespite multiple reports of mortality rates exceeding 50% among critically ill adults with COVID-19, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, our early experience indicates that many patients survive their critical illness.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 7 million of people around the world since December 2019 and in the United States has resulted so far in more than 100,000 deaths [1]. Epidemiological studies have shown that 6 to 10% of patients develop a more severe form of COVID-19 and will require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [2]. Most of these patients admitted to ICU, will finally require invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) due to diffuse lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nThe ICUs employed dedicated respiratory therapists, with extensive training in the care of patients with ARDS. We considered the following criteria to admit patients to ICU: 1) Oxygen saturation (O2 sat) less than 93% on more than 6 liters oxygen (O2) via nasal cannula (NC) or PO2 < 65 mmHg with 6 liters or more O2, or respiratory rate (RR) more than 22 per minute on 6 liters O2, 2) PO2/FIO2 ratio less than 300, 3) any patient with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 already on requiring MV or with previous criteria.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-09-16\nTitle: Why More Covid-19 Patients Are Surviving the ICU | Elemental\nContent:\nThe virus is now known to cause problems in other organs, including the heart, kidneys, and brain.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better.

As cancer progresses, the body becomes more and more acidic as its pH drops below 7.35. His discoveries were revolutionary for their time, and contributed greatly to what we know about cancer today. The pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2019-05-08, explains the concept of the alkaline diet and its origins. It states that the body's pH level is tightly regulated and cannot be significantly altered through diet. The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, with 0-6 being acidic, 7 neutral, and 8-14 basic. The body strives to maintain a pH of 7.365. Eating an 80/20 ratio of alkaline to acidic foods is recommended for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2019-07-03, further emphasizes the importance of maintaining an alkaline state in the body to prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health. It suggests a breathing technique to alkalize the body.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, undated but published by the same source, reinforce the idea that diet does not affect the pH of the body. The body maintains a constant, slightly alkaline pH in the blood, and diseases like cancer live in slightly alkaline environments. The alkaline diet, consisting of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, is considered healthy but does not change pH levels in the blood or body.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2017-06-16, focuses on the importance of consuming alkaline foods to neutralize acidity in the body. It promotes alkaline water as a means to maintain health and prevent illness.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-02-26, states that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. However, the information presented suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body. The body tightly regulates its pH, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments. Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide protection against contagion.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion.

We will also continue to engage with Note Circulation Scheme members and ATM operators to get an up-to-date view on customer demand for banknotes. We will continue to hold interviews with a range of large retailers to learn more about their cash holdings, the cash trends they are seeing and their attitudes to cash acceptance.\n2022 also saw travel disruptions, often due to staff shortages in the travel industry, which may be discouraging people from taking holidays overseas. Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel weighed in on the appropriate soundtrack to the president’s bare-faced appearance at the Honeywell aerospace plant in Phoenix. “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song ‘Live and Let Die’ blares in the background,” Kimmel wrote on Twitter.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges Americans to wear face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 71,000 people in the U.S. in less than three months. Face coverings are thought to protect the people around the person wearing the mask as much as the mask-wearer.

The Donald and his entourage were at a Honeywell factory to witness the production of anti-COVID-19 N95 masks, with the soundtrack reportedly consisting of the likes of Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger and Animals' House Of The Rising Sun. But, as Trump turned to one worker to ask how many masks were made in a day, symphonic rock hit Live And Let Die could be heard playing in the background.\nOf course, the internet instantly jumped on the irony of the track playing over Trump's visit, with U.S. TV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.\nTV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.

In the mitigation strategy interventions have to be timely instituted (not too early) to give chance for herd immunity to develop.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Scientists say epidemic suppression is only viable option\nContent:\nIn the UK, this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK (previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated) and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity. “We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\nThe report by Imperial College’s COVID-19 Response Team - Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand – looked at two different strategies.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for ...\nContent:\nIn other words, we simulated a situation that from the second day of receiving confirmed case, only 5% of the overall population would be possible to contact the infectious ones. Then, the β2 = 0.05. The results were shown in the Fig 5. The results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time.\nThe results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time. There would be only more than 40 people that were infection and finally recovered at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. The overall period of COVID outbreak was less than 100 days.\nAmong a variety of factors leading to emergence and outbreaks of ID, the key issues are population density and human mobility where in these cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to at least 146 countries and territories on 6 continents in 2 months.\nAs implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. For COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [11] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results showed that under strong suppression of “lockdown Hubei”, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression ...\nContent:\nFor each scenario, we modeled the first suppression to have been initiated at the median threshold for the setting that has been observed to date (i.e., LICs and LMICs initiate earlier than UMICs and HICs, Table 1). We then selected the ICU incidence trigger within this range that minimizes COVID-19 mortality over 18 months and remains under our ICU threshold. We use a time window of 18 months as representative of the time scale over which pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., a vaccine) may become available, noting that this duration is highly uncertain (25).\nA full understanding of these will only be available retrospectively. Although our results illustrate the challenges that many countries will face in attempting to mitigate the impact of local COVID-19 epidemics, it is important to bear in mind that even moderate levels of changes in behavior can avert many infections and hence save millions of lives (30). Although suppression will always have the greatest impact on COVID-related morbidity and mortality, the intensity of interventions required needs to be balanced against the wider health risks that diverting all attention to a single disease could entail (31, 32).\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, supports the claim that COVID-19 suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time. The information is based on research from the Imperial College London, which has directly informed U.K. policy. The findings suggest that suppressing the outbreak rather than mitigating it would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die in the U.K. and the United States.\n\nInformation 2, while published later, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of the report by Neil Ferguson et al. on decision-making during the crisis, and the two strategies (mitigation and suppression) investigated in the report.\n\nInformation 3, like Information 1, supports the claim. It explains that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time, based on the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 and the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity.\n\nInformation 4, while discussing a different topic (a feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies), does not contradict the claim. It presents a scenario where the outbreak of COVID-19 is successfully controlled through suppression strategies.\n\nInformation 5, like Information 4, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression, but does not argue against the claim that suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is likely true. Suppression is presented as the only viable strategy for minimizing the toll of the new coronavirus in Information 1, 3, and the claim. The other information does not contradict this claim.", "response": "TRUE."}

If the content described by the CLAIM is correct, then classify it as TRUE; if the content described by the CLAIM is incorrect, then classify it as FALSE.\n\nCLAIM:\nPublication date: 2020-11-19\nContent: The total number of deaths in the U.S. this year is significantly down compared to previous years, so COVID-19 restrictions weren’t needed.\n\nPRIOR KNOWLEDGE:\nInformation 1:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19\nContent:\nDeath counts were derived from the National Vital Statistics System database that provides the timeliest access to the vital statistics mortality data and may differ slightly from other sources due to differences in completeness, COVID-19 definitions used, data processing, and imputation of missing dates. Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ... Select a dashboard: Weekly Excess Deaths Excess deaths with and without COVID-19 Excess deaths with and without weighting Number of Excess Deaths\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The true death toll of COVID-19: estimating global excess mortality\nContent:\nThe COVID TAG considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability and extensibility proposed a negative binomial regression model. The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.\nDeaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. The provisional data presented on this page include the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; by week ending date, month, and year, and specific jurisdictions.\nDeath counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. Information 5 is from the National Center for Health Statistics and provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 in the US.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that the total number of deaths in the US in 2020 is significantly down compared to previous years is false. In fact, the opposite is true. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a large increase in total US deaths in 2020, with deaths still up 19.7% in 2021 compared to 2019. The claim appears to be an attempt to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in the US.", "response": "FALSE."}

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years.\nThe estimates presented may be an early indication of excess mortality related to COVID-19, but should be interpreted with caution, until confirmed by other data sources such as state or local health departments. It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data.\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.\nAs some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.

The claim originated from David Martin and the New Earth Project. According to the CDC and FDA, a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to build defenses against a disease-causing microorganism, preventing disease in the vaccinated individual. It is still unclear whether the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna can stop transmission of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-01-12, is a report on the same claim by David Martin, stating that the COVID-19 RNA vaccines do not meet the definitions of a vaccine according to the CDC and FDA.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, explains that mRNA vaccines use a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a protein on a virus and that vaccines for COVID-19 are the only mRNA vaccines authorized or approved by the FDA.\n\nInformation 4, also with no publication date, discusses recent advances in mRNA vaccine technology, assesses mRNA vaccines currently in development for cancer and infectious diseases, and considers future directions and challenges.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, explains that the FDA has regulatory processes in place to facilitate the development of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the FDA's rigorous scientific standards.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the COVID-19 RNA vaccine is not a vaccine is false. According to the CDC and FDA, a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to build defenses against a disease-causing microorganism, thereby preventing disease in the vaccinated individual. The COVID-19 RNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been approved for emergency use by the FDA and meet this definition. It is still unclear whether these vaccines can stop transmission of the virus, but this does not change the fact that they are vaccines.\n\nThe claim that a vaccine has to disrupt transmission by CDC and FDA standards is also false. While it is true that vaccines typically aim to prevent transmission of a disease, this is not a requirement for a product to be considered a vaccine.\n\nThe claim that the COVID-19 RNA vaccine activates the cell to become a pathogen-manufacturing site is misleading. The vaccine does contain a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a protein on the virus, but this does not make the cell a pathogen-manufacturing site. The mRNA instructs the cell to produce the protein, but it does not become a part of the virus or make the cell infectious.\n\nReasonable evidence for the verification of the claim includes the definitions of a vaccine provided by the CDC and FDA, as well as the information provided by the FDA regarding the regulatory processes for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the fact-checks by Science Feedback and the information about mRNA vaccines from MedlinePlus Genetics and Nature Reviews Drug Discovery provide further evidence that the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F.Infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-140 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses from what we know from extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\nLuckily, the science is becoming more accepted now that saunas can kill coronavirus. According to a PDF from the Alaska Department of Health, saunas must remain at 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\nUse a thermometer gun like this to make sure even the floors reach 160 degrees F for 60 minutes.

Traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F. Infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses from what we know from extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\nCoronaviruses (MERS-CoV) died when under environmental circumstances of 56 degrees Celsius (132 degrees F) for 25 minutes. Increasing the temperature to 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees F) was even better and only one minute was needed to kill viruses. No killing was observed after 2 hours at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees F).\nWe’ve had a lot of questions over the past couple of months about whether the heat of an infrared sauna can kill coronavirus. We address this below. But the better question is, how about not getting it, or reducing the chances, or even recovering faster rather than looking at an IR Sauna as a means of cure or immunity.\nCoronavirus infectivity was completely lost after 14 days of incubation at 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees F), 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees F), or 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees F) but remained constant at 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 degrees F) for the same length of time. Based on these points alone, it seems a sauna can kill coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna can kill the novel coronavirus. The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness.

In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown.

These are often driven by the pre-existing obsessions of the various conspiracy groups: while some continue to focus centrally on the supposed ill health effects of 5G radiation itself (even to the point of denying that there is a coronavirus at all, and claiming that COVID-19 is merely a cover story to explain the effects of the 5G tests in Wuhan), others now position 5G as part of a much larger and more complex agenda that involves bioengineered viruses and deadly, 5G-activated vaccines.\nIt remains unclear at this stage whether this claim is related directly to early reports about the COVID-19 outbreak or represents a more general, pre-existing fear. (The term COVID-19 itself was introduced by the WHO only on 11 February 2020, and these early posts are therefore necessarily somewhat vague about their subject; cf. WHO, 2020.) Some such posts explicitly re-share much older Facebook posts that anticipate that the active extermination phase will be triggered by a ‘pandemic virus’, however, and this act of re-sharing can be interpreted as making a deliberate link between such pre-existing conspiracy theories and the present outbreak.\nThe 5G connection is not the only COVID-19-related conspiracy, of course (one of the more prominent theories, for example, claims that the virus was developed in a laboratory in Wuhan, from where it was accidentally or intentionally released). Such theories circulate perhaps because people have been seeking some more tangible (rather than literally invisible) causes for such massive social and economic disruptions.1\nDuring the first weeks of January, very few Facebook posts match our selection criteria; indeed, even those that do relate only very loosely, if at all, to the COVID-19 outbreak. Rather, these posts repeat typical conspiracist tropes about secret plans to exterminate the majority of the world’s population through a combination of water fluoridation, mass vaccination, chemtrails, genetically modified foods and ‘toxic’ 5G emissions (that is, they are mostly a continuation of the extant anti-science/technology rhetoric). It remains unclear at this stage whether this claim is related directly to early reports about the COVID-19 outbreak or represents a more general, pre-existing fear.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis ...\nContent:\nKeywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, twitter, misinformation, fake news, 5G, social network analysis, social media, public health, pandemic · The coronavirus strains have been known since 1960 and usually cause up to 15% of common colds in humans each year, mainly in mild forms. Previously two variants of coronavirus have caused severe illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, with severe acute respiratory distress, resulting in 9.6% mortality; and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, with a higher mortality rate of 34.4% [1-3]. The novel coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2), the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that probably originated in a seafood market in Wuhan in December 2019 [4,5]. Since then, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), named by the World Health Organization, has affected more than 2 million people worldwide, killing more than 130,000 of them [6].

Facebook says it’s significantly expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus. The company once simply flagged these posts as having been fact-checked, using third-party partners like Lead Stories and Full Fact. Now posts that include false claims about 5G and Covid-19 are being taken down, along with other false coronavirus-related content.\nShe said in a tweet, “If you try to connect the dots from Covid-19 (which I am implying is a made-up illness to explain the side effects of the 5G rollout) to 5G, the media will tell you it is a conspiracy theory.” · Conspiracy theorists have also connected the 5G narrative with the claim that Bill Gates might be behind the virus, which is currently the most popular Covid-19 conspiracy theory online, according to Zignal Labs.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak. Three months later, conspiracy theorists making similar claims were setting cellphone towers on fire in Europe. Gregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread.\nDespite what the internet might be telling you, cellphones did not cause the Covid-19 pandemic. ...

While many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors.\nIndeed, even the core concerns about electromagnetic sensitivity are not unique to mobile telecommunications. Anti-windfarm activists have also made similar erroneous claims about links between windfarms and electromagnetic sensitivity, and EMF exposure (McCallum et al., 2014). There are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19.\nThere are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer. Indeed, this line of thinking was already present in anti-5G circles and it was merely amplified when the pandemic emerged as a new risk vector, one that directly challenged people’s immune system (Asher Hamilton, 2020a).\nThe idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer. Indeed, this line of thinking was already present in anti-5G circles and it was merely amplified when the pandemic emerged as a new risk vector, one that directly challenged people’s immune system (Asher Hamilton, 2020a). The second and more prominent conspiracy moves well away from these historical concerns with EMF exposure. Instead, it argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The conspiracy of Covid-19 and 5G: Spatial analysis fallacies in ...\nContent:\nThroughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data.\nOthers have argued that 5G was first tested in Wuhan, China, the city linked to the first cases of COVID-19, which proves it is the cause of the virus. Still others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020).\nStill others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020). In all iterations, 5G is depicted as either “Satan's strategy” to advance the apocalypse, or the work of a techno-capitalist government cabal that seeks to reduce the population, profit from a vaccine, or embed micro-chips into the vaccine for the purposes of surveillance or control (Wu, 2020).\nKeywords: Conspiracy theories, Spatial data, Health geography, Public data, COVID-19, 5G · When COVID-19 reached European and American cities, alternative knowledge claims quickly emerged confronting official accounts of the cause of the virus. Rather than spawning new conspiracy theories, COVID-19 has led to improvisations on many older ones, in this case linking it to mobile electromagnetic frequencies, using many of the same logical and methodological fallacies to “prove” their veracity (Sturm and Albrecht, 2021).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published likely in 2020, discusses the emergence of COVID-19/5G conspiracy theories on Facebook. The theories claim that 5G technology is causing the illness, and some even deny the existence of the coronavirus. These theories circulated as early as January 2020, and were shared by users on Facebook, often linking to pre-existing conspiracy theories about extermination plans involving 5G emissions.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, presents an analysis of the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter. The study found that there was a lack of an authority figure actively combating such misinformation, and that policymakers should isolate opinions based on fake news to avoid public health damage.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 24, 2020, explains the conspiracy theory about 5G causing the coronavirus pandemic. The theory originated from a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés in January 2020 and spread rapidly on the internet. Despite fact-checking efforts, conspiracy theorists have continued to connect 5G technology with the pandemic and set cellphone towers on fire in Europe.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, discusses the two types of conspiracy theories associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers the immune system, making people more susceptible to the virus. The second conspiracy theory argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not specified, outlines how spatial data has been co-opted by conspiracy theorists to assert a correlation between 5G and COVID-19. These theories are not fringe phenomena and are often distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the installation of 5G towers.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that the COVID-19 pandemic was fake and that 5G telecommunications is causing the illness.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nBased on the provided information, the claim is false. The COVID-19 pandemic is a real and serious public health crisis, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that 5G technology causes the illness. In fact, the information suggests that conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to the pandemic have been circulating on social media since early 2020, despite fact-checking efforts to debunk these claims. These theories have led to harmful consequences, such as the destruction of cellphone towers in Europe. Therefore, it is important to rely on credible sources of information and to avoid spreading misinformation about the pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

Ortega is the only Latin American leader who has not made a single public announcement on how his government would address the pandemic. Vice President Rosario Murillo, Ortega’s wife, told Nicaraguans to remain calm and continue working.\nOn March 23, the Health Ministry recommended a voluntary quarantine for any traveler arriving from a country with COVID-19 cases, indicating a slight change in the government’s position.

Ortega adopted stepdaughter Zoilamérica Narváez in 1986, through a court case.\nJosé Daniel Ortega Saavedra (Spanish pronunciation: [daˈnjel oɾˈteɣa]; born 11 November 1945) is a Nicaraguan politician who has been President of Nicaragua since 2007. Previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as coordinator (1979–1985) of the Junta of National Reconstruction, and then as President of Nicaragua (1985–1990). During his first term, he implemented policies to achieve leftist reforms across Nicaragua. In later years, Ortega's left-wing radical politics cooled significantly, leading him to pursue pro-business policies and even rapprochement with the Catholic Church.\nIn 1998, Daniel Ortega's adopted stepdaughter Zoilamérica Narváez released a 48-page report in which she alleged he had sexually abused her from 1979, when she was 12, until 1990. Ortega and his wife Murillo denied the allegation. The case could not proceed in Nicaraguan courts, which have been consistently allied with Ortega, because he had immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament, and the five-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse and rape charges had expired.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-16\nTitle: Nicaraguan president reappears after more than a month out of public ...\nContent:\n<strong>Nicaraguan</strong> <strong>President</strong> <strong>Daniel</strong> <strong>Ortega</strong> appeared on Wednesday in a live broadcast on national television after being absent from public life for a month, raising questions about his health and whereabouts as the world reels from the novel coronavirus.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-06\nTitle: Where Is Daniel Ortega?

The vice president got roasted on Twitter, on TV and by the campaign of Joe Biden after being caught by a live microphone jokingly offering to carry empty boxes \"just for the camera\" into a nursing home treating coronavirus cases. The offer, seemingly made in jest, came during a photo opportunity for media on Thursday at the the Woodbine Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Alexandria, Virginia. This happened a day before a Pence aide tested positive for coronavirus, and on the same day that news broke that a personal valet for President Donald Trump also tested positive for the virus, which causes Covid-19.\n\"Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing: A big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing,\" Kimmel cracked.

Pence was joking about carrying empty boxes for a staged publicity stunt, as Kimmel later acknowledged. The claim that Pence pretended the boxes were heavy when they were empty is not supported by the evidence.", "response": "FALSE."}

Ensuring racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials for development of COVID-19 vaccines is particularly important since COVID-19 has taken a heavy disproportionate toll on people of color, and people of color, particularly Black adults, historically have had lower vaccination rates and express more concerns about getting a COVID-19 vaccine compared to their White counterparts.\nOther access challenges, such as prohibitive distance to trial sites for people with limited transportation options, limited flexibility in work and caregiving schedules, and lack of access to technology for monitoring that may be required as part of the trial also may increase barriers to participation among people of color. Beyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color.\nBeyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation.

This virus appears to have originated within Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17,18,19. In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705). Samples were stored in viral transport medium at −80 °C directly after collection.\nIn 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. This emerging human virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, and also appears to have originated in horseshoe bats20,21—with its full genome 96% similar to a viral sequence reported from Rhinolophus affinis20. Closely related sequences were also identified in Malayan pangolins22,23. A growing body of research has identified bats as the evolutionary sources of SARS—and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—CoVs13,14,24,25,26, and as the source of progenitors for the human CoVs, NL63 and 229E27,28.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-01-30\nTitle: False: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the ...\nContent:\nExplanation: The current analysis indicate that there is no <strong>pig</strong> element in <strong>the</strong> <strong>virus</strong>. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Wuhan</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> originated mostly from SARS <strong>and</strong> <strong>bats</strong>, not from <strong>pigs</strong>.

Pigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species.\nPigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species. Moreover, a team at Zhejiang University in the Chinese city of Hangzhou found that the SADS virus could infect cells from many organisms in a petri dish, including rodents, chickens, nonhuman primates and humans. Given the scale of swine farming in many countries, such as China and the U.S., Gray says, looking for novel coronaviruses in pigs should be a top priority.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mystery virus found in Wuhan resembles bat viruses but not SARS, ...\nContent:\nSo far, the novel <strong>coronavirus</strong> has been found in 15 patients; no new cases reported since 5 January\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Cross-Species Transmission of Coronaviruses in Humans ...\nContent:\nPubMed Abstract | CrossRef Full Text | Google Scholar · 90.

Nonetheless, civets may have amplified the virus and brought it closer to humans (35). Additional mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, common marmosets, grivets, and cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be infected under experimental inoculation, seroconvert, and display similar pathological signs as humans, and the monkeys and guinea pigs usually display mild clinical signs, while cats and golden hamsters show no clinical signs (36–44).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study conducted by Tufts University and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences found that bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, researchers have pointed out that managing the pandemic response will require leveraging insights from the social and behavioral sciences, particularly with regard to non-pharmaceutical interventions and containing the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 (Depoux et al., 2020; Habersaat et al., 2020; Van Bavel et al., 2020).\nFake news about the virus has also been actively promoted by political elites, such as President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who falsely claimed that hydroxychloroquine is “working in all places” as a treatment against the virus (Constine, 2020). But misinformation about COVID-19 is not limited to information that is blatantly true or false, which widens the scope of the problem.\nThe inoculation effect itself can last for months (Pfau and Bockern, 1994), including with regular “top-ups” or “booster shots” following gameplay (Maertens et al., 2020b). In response to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, we altered the Bad News game’s “conspiracy” scenario to feature weakened doses of conspiracies about the virus.

Coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses named for the crown-like spikes on the virus. SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses, but many of these viruses cause illnesses like the common cold.\nSome Lysol and Clorox products are already proven to fight some strains of coronaviruses. This year’s Novel Coronavirus, otherwise labeled 2019-ncov, hasn’t been around long enough for companies to test the effectiveness of sprays or wipes. Much of how the virus spreads remains unknown, which contributes to public concerns about the epidemic as cases top 20,000 in China.\nSome corners of the Internet are crafting conspiracy theories, claiming that America knew about the coronavirus before it was publicized, and that’s why the companies are able to list the virus on their packaging. It’s important to keep in mind when searching for information online that this year’s coronavirus is not the only one out there.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-02-27, explains that Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels that mention the \"Human Coronavirus.\" However, these labels refer to previously identified strains of the human coronavirus, not the new strain behind the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos are misleading by suggesting that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-01-31, discusses false claims on social media that Clorox and Lysol already knew about the new coronavirus. These claims arise from disinfectant product labels listing \"Human Coronavirus,\" which has led to confusion about the different strains of the virus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-06, reiterates the previous information that disinfectant products were tested against a strain of coronavirus that causes the common cold, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-03-13, provides a list of disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), but it does not mention Lysol or Clorox products specifically.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-02-05, clarifies that some Lysol and Clorox products can fight some strains of coronaviruses, but they have not specifically tested their products against the new 2019-nCoV strain.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that a bottle of disinfectant from 2015 shows coronavirus, suggesting that the virus is not new, is not entirely accurate. According to the provided information, Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels mentioning \"Human Coronavirus,\" but they refer to previously identified strains, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos have misleadingly suggested that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially false, as it incorrectly implies that the label on the 2015 disinfectant bottle refers to the new COVID-19 strain. It is crucial to understand that the \"Human Coronavirus\" mentioned on disinfectant product labels refers to previously identified strains, not the new strain that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

Researchers discovered significant sex differences in risk factors associated with AMI and in the strength of associations among young adults, suggesting the need for a sex-specific preventive strategy.\nResearchers discovered significant sex differences in risk factors associated with AMI and in the strength of associations among young adults, suggesting the need for a sex-specific preventive strategy. For example, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty had stronger associations with AMI in women compared with men, they found. The study was published May 3 in JAMA Network Open. While heart attacks are often associated with older adults, this population-based case-control study examined the relationships among a wide range of AMI-related risk factors involving younger adults.\nThe study found that seven risk factors, many potentially modifiable, collectively accounted for a majority of the total risk of AMI in young women (83.9%) and young men (85.1%). Some of these factors — including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty — have a larger impact on young woman than they do among young men, Lu and her colleagues found. “This study speaks to the importance of specifically studying young women suffering heart attacks, a group that has largely been neglected in many studies and yet is about as large as the number of young women diagnosed with breast cancer,” said Harlan M.\nRaising awareness about the incidence of heart attacks in younger women is a key part of the strategy, she said. The next frontier of cardiovascular disease prevention in young women could be better understanding the role of women-related factors. Previous studies have shown that women-related factors may be associated with risk of heart attack, but there is limited data on women under the age of 55.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-05-15\nTitle: Women and Heart Disease | cdc.gov\nContent:\nHeart attack: Chest pain or discomfort, upper back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea or vomiting, extreme fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath ...

So far, 32 bodies buried in 2020 have been claimed and removed from the graveyard.\nThe week beginning April 6, 138 people were buried there as a result of COVID-19 because morgues were overfilled; at one point, the rate of burials went from roughly 25 a week to around 25 a day. “This trench was supposed to last us the whole year,” Thompson says, looking over the mass grave.\nAt the height of the outbreak last spring, New York’s hospital morgues and mortuaries became overwhelmed, and the mass graves on Hart Island emerged as an expedient option for the city’s fast-rising number of dead.

The FBI learned of the supplies during an investigation by the Department of Justice’s COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force on March 30 and told HHS.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1, published on April 20, 2020, is a fact-checking article by AFP that debunks the claim that the FBI seized boxes of N95 masks that tested positive for the coronavirus. The masks were actually seized from an alleged hoarder in Brooklyn, USA who was selling them at a very high markup. The masks were later distributed to health workers in New York and New Jersey. The article also mentions that the video of the seizure had gone viral on YouTube and Facebook with false captions.\n\nInformation 2, published on an unspecified date, is a fact-checking article by Africa Check that also debunks the claim in the video. It explains that the N95 masks are personal protective equipment used by medical workers and the video does not show the FBI taking back infected masks from China.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 3, 2020, is an article by The New York Times that reports on the seizure of a huge stockpile of medical supplies, including 192,000 N95 respirators, from an alleged hoarder in Brooklyn. The supplies were later distributed to medical personnel in New York and New Jersey.\n\nInformation 4, published on April 24, 2020, is a fact-checking article by Reuters that debunks a false claim about a video showing FBI agents seizing masks infected with the novel coronavirus. The video actually shows a raid on the home of a man in New York arrested for allegedly coughing on FBI agents while claiming to have COVID-19 and lying to them about hoarding and selling medical supplies.\n\nInformation 5, published on April 2, 2020, is an article by The Washington Post that reports on the distribution of 192,000 N95 masks seized from hoarders to medical personnel in New York and New Jersey.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that the FBI seized boxes of N95 masks that tested positive for the coronavirus is false. The masks were actually seized from an alleged hoarder in Brooklyn, USA who was selling them at a very high markup. The masks were later distributed to health workers in New York and New Jersey. This information is consistent across all the articles and was reported by reputable news sources such as AFP, Africa Check, The New York Times, Reuters, and The Washington Post.\n\nThe video of the seizure went viral on YouTube and Facebook with false captions, leading to the spread of misinformation. However, all the fact-checking articles confirm that the masks were not seized because they tested positive for the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim is false and should not be believed.\n\nIt is important to verify the accuracy of information before sharing it, especially during a crisis when misinformation can cause panic and harm. Fact-checking websites such as Snopes, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact can be useful resources for verifying the accuracy of claims.

The Facebook posts further leave a misleading impression when saying the coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) is “airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!” The term “airborne,” we note, is used differently by different people and is the subject of some debate.\nAnd the idea that the virus remains infectious in the air for “8 hrs” is not supported — and there’s no requirement that people wear masks at all times.

Health workers, caregivers and visitors must perform hand hygiene any time they touch their medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.\nWearing a mask reduces the spread of respiratory illnesses within the community by reducing the number of infectious particles that may be inhaled or exhaled. These particles may be spread when an infected individual talks, sings, shouts, coughs, or sneezes (even if not symptomatic). Hence, masks may provide protection to the wearer and those around them.\nIn other situations, not included in the above, you should assess your individual risk to determine if a mask should be worn.

According to the CDC, there is no requirement for healthy people to wear masks, but they should be worn by those who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms, as well as by healthcare workers and caregivers.

Healthy individuals do not need to wear masks, but they should be worn by those who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms, as well as by healthcare workers and caregivers.\n\nSecond, the claim that the virus is infectious in the air for 8 hours is not supported by the information provided.

The Arakan Army, through its alliance with two other ethnic armed groups, has also announced a unilateral ceasefire, but the war shows no sign of abating.\nSee, for example, “Myanmar military to lend state-of-the-art machines for public COVID-19 testing”, The Irrawaddy, 27 April 2020; and “Inside Phaunggyi, Myanmar’s ambitious response to COVID-19”, Frontier Myanmar, 23 April 2020.Hide Footnote A looming closed-door UN Security Council meeting to discuss escalating violence in Rakhine and the effect of the pandemic likely also played a role. [fn]“UN Security Council to discuss violence, coronavirus in Myanmar”, Agence France-Presse, 12 May 2020.Hide Footnote · The nature of the conflict in Rakhine State makes a truly national ceasefire extremely unlikely.\nAlthough it has yet to experience a major COVID-19 outbreak, Myanmar remains highly vulnerable to the pandemic. It is crucial that the country’s health response include coordination with the twenty ethnic armed groups that control territory, especially as most of them operate close to the country’s borders with China and Thailand. A truly national ceasefire is unlikely, unfortunately, due to the conflict in Rakhine State, but in other parts of the country the barrier to cooperation in the health sector has less to do with conflict than with lack of political will and trust.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: Myanmar’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nContent:\nAs of November 20, Rakhine had the fourth-highest confirmed cases in the country, and they continue to grow. The government has supplied personal protective equipment at campsites for internally displaced persons (IDPs), but congestion and poor living conditions in IDP camps heighten transmission risk. Myanmar is yet to reach the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, so the full scale of responses to tackle the pandemic is still not clear. But the current state of the pandemic, the government’s responses, and lessons from other countries point to three areas that need attention.\nMyanmar has to build capacity and forge connections with local clinicians and businesses to make affordable testing kits and essential supplies.

Improve the quarantine facility model. Myanmar might consider incorporating the Fangcang shelter model into new quarantine centers.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-01, highlights the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar, focusing on Rakhine state, which had the fourth-highest confirmed cases in the country as of November 20. The government has supplied personal protective equipment at IDP camps, but congestion and poor living conditions increase transmission risk. Myanmar is yet to reach the peak of the outbreak, and three areas that need attention are highlighted: building capacity and forging connections with local clinicians and businesses to make affordable testing kits and essential supplies, training nongovernment health care workers to test for COVID-19 and permitting nongovernment laboratories to analyze swabs, and improving the quarantine facility model.\n\nInformation 2 and 3, both without publication dates, reaffirm the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations' commitment to support Myanmar in meeting the humanitarian challenges in Rakhine State, including in response to COVID-19. They mention the surge of COVID-19 cases in Rakhine State, with 96 confirmed cases as of late March, 80 of which were between 16 and 25 August, and 82 cases that have been transmitted locally. The United Nations and its humanitarian partners have carried out COVID-19 preparedness activities in camps and sites for internally displaced people in Rakhine State and elsewhere.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-19, discusses the conflict in Rakhine State and its impact on limiting the spread of COVID-19. The Myanmar government and ethnic armed groups appear willing to put aside politics and work together to prevent the spread of COVID-19, except in Rakhine State, where conflict is escalating, putting medical workers at risk and exacerbating a potential health disaster.\n\nInformation 5 is identical to Information 1, published on 2020-12-01.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-09, states that images with claims that the Myanmar government should send COVID-19 quarantine people to buildings in Rakhine state have been shared. Given the information available, it is not possible to confirm or deny the existence of these images, as they are not provided. However, considering the situation in Rakhine State as described in the information above, it is plausible that such images exist, as Rakhine State had a high number of confirmed cases and poor living conditions in IDP camps increased transmission risk. However, without the actual images, it is impossible to determine if they specifically call for quarantining people in the buildings mentioned. Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Not even the protective masks can hide the smiles. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus has hospitalized more than 900 county residents and killed more than 165 in a worldwide war that seems months if not years away from ending. So at hospitals throughout the region, every victory against a scary and tenacious enemy has become cause for celebration.\nHealthcare workers celebrate as Claudia Martinez is discharged from the ICU after she was extubated and recovered from COVID-19 symptoms at Scripps Mercy Hospital in Chula Vista on April 23, 2020. ... Each discharge celebration is different, tailored to the patient. Some want music and an iPad recording. Others are more private. But the gauntlet of hospital staff doing the standing ovation is a constant. Now the celebration idea has spread to other Scripps hospitals, each adding its own twist.\nShe helped with the celebrations at UC San Diego’s hospitals in La Jolla and Hillcrest by arranging for a custom melody to be written and recorded. The health system already had what it calls “chimes” that sound on certain occasions — one for when a baby is born, another when someone donates an organ. After Meehan saw internet videos of nurses in Washington state celebrating COVID-19 recoveries with a special tune, she wanted to do that here, too.\nBack came a guitar melody that gets played now to mark COVID-19 recoveries and departures, sent via PA speakers throughout the medical centers, so people not directly involved in patient care can hear it, too. Meehan said the tune appears to be boosting staff morale, bringing some hope and triumph in a troubling time. “It’s not even 10 a.m.,” a colleague emailed her one day recently, “and I’ve already heard it three times!” ... At Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, the celebrations started three weeks ago with a 73-year-old woman who had been there for 20 days.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Celebrating Life’s Milestones in the Hospital During COVID-19 | AHA\nContent:\nSo they are connecting patients with family members virtually, cheering patients when they leave the hospital to return home — and celebrating patients’ birthdays. ...

The newlyweds had been married only a couple of months when the unvaccinated Isaiah was put on a ventilator. Both described the horror of dealing with Isaiah’s hospitalization and the uncertainty around his recovery.\nBut I’m glad I have it now.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that even those who had COVID-19 are better protected if they receive the vaccination.

Kemah Zinnah, an intensive care nurse at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, waited “with bated breath” hoping that no more Covid-19 patients would arrive after two died more than a week ago.\nKemah Zinnah, an intensive care nurse at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, waited “with bated breath” hoping that no more Covid-19 patients would arrive after two died more than a week ago. “Maybe we’re seeing the end to this influx of patients, and so far, fingers crossed, we are lucky,\" Zinnah said. \"We haven’t seen any yet.\" Zinnah is one of many health care professionals who celebrated on Twitter a return to more normal hospital business after more than a year of being overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases.\nFor Sellers and other health care workers, the lack of Covid-19 patients is a step toward easing the mental trauma that responding to the pandemic created. “You had to call their families every day, multiple times a day, if things weren’t going well especially. That took a toll,” Sellers said. “At the height of things, I was struggling to just not be completely worn down by all of the horror and sadness that we saw every day.” · Sellers estimated that her hospital would see 40 to 60 Covid-19 patients at once at the height of the pandemic — a dramatic difference from the hospital’s current numbers.\nThe declining number of Covid-19 hospital patients can be credited to the success of vaccinations, according to health care workers, who urged Americans to get vaccinated. Jeremy Faust, a doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said that as vaccine eligibility expanded to more age groups, he began to see fewer Covid-19 patients on his shifts.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-11, describes how hospitals in the region celebrate the discharge of COVID-19 patients.

Former President Mahama bastardised these programmes with ghost names and dubious modules leading to flying Guinea Fowls.\nLadies and gentlemen of the media, stakeholders in our growing democracy and friends, despite pressing concerns to do with re-energising livelihoods, funding public infrastructure and services and putting people back to work in this difficult Covid-19 recovery period, we are being forced into a premature 2024 general election campaign by the posture and pronouncements of losing Candidate Mahama. We have to be ready. We have to respond. Many well-meaning Ghanaians and friends of Ghana worry that John Mahama’s attitude and words set Ghana back and so it’s critical that the NPP is ready.

A lengthy video, published on YouTube on 2 April by the notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke, claims that COVID-19 itself is a scam and is instead caused by 5G technology.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nFacebook says it’s significantly expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus. The company once simply flagged these posts as having been fact-checked, using third-party partners like Lead Stories and Full Fact. Now posts that include false claims about 5G and Covid-19 are being taken down, along with other false coronavirus-related content.\nA spokesperson told Recode that the platform is prioritizing taking down posts that include “a call to action that could potentially cause harm.” The company says that since March 18, it’s taken down more than 2,200 tweets violating its rules around Covid-19 content. There’s a chance this struggle to contain a dangerous conspiracy theory will endure. Part of what drove the 5G coronavirus conspiracy to the mainstream was a lack of good information about how the virus spreads and how it works, questions that scientists are still working to answer.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak.\nOthers float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis ...\nContent:\nIn the first week of January, some social media users pointed to 5G as being the cause of COVID-19 or accelerating its spread. The issue became a trending topic and appeared visible to all users on Twitter within the United Kingdom. Since then, multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking the two together. The conspiracy has been of such a serious nature that, in Birmingham and Merseyside, United Kingdom, 5G masts were torched over concerns associating this technology and the spread of the disease according to the British Broadcasting Corporation [9]. More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10]. This is unwelcome damage especially at a time when hospitals are required to operate with maximum efficiency.\nThe majority of influential users tweeting about 5G and COVID-19 consisted of members of the public sharing their views and opinions or news articles and videos supporting their cause. A key feature of the accounts was that they were actively engaged in sharing conspiracy theories; their bios included words such as “uncover” and “truth.”\nInterestingly, results show that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account (created on January 24, 2012), whose sole purpose was to raise awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G, and the account was named “5gcoronavirus19.” This account was in the group labeled “activism account” in Figure 1. The account creation date appears to be 2012, which suggests that a previously created account was converted, as Twitter allows users to change their user handle and username. The account has since been removed; however, the account bio description was “5G causes our immune system to lower and we become more susceptible to viruses.\nKeywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, twitter, misinformation, fake news, 5G, social network analysis, social media, public health, pandemic · The coronavirus strains have been known since 1960 and usually cause up to 15% of common colds in humans each year, mainly in mild forms.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Viral video claiming 5G caused pandemic easily debunked | CBC News\nContent:\nCowan claims that Wuhan, the location where the COVID-19 outbreak began, was the first city to be covered by 5G. He insists that this is proof that these two things are linked. However, cities in South Korea and the U.S. had 5G networks ... Also of note, Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network, alongside other countries like Japan and Malaysia, also hit hard by the pandemic.\nKindrachuk also said he has seen variations of the theory that 5G causes illness emerge long before the COVID-19 outbreak. \"It's actually been something that the anti-vax community has used fairly frequently as part of their argument against vaccination. So I'm not surprised.\nAccording to a review of public health records, the journal found that \"a combination of fresh air, sunlight, scrupulous standards of hygiene and reusable face masks appears to have substantially reduced deaths among some patients and infections among medical staff.\" ... Cowan claims that Wuhan, the location where the COVID-19 outbreak began, was the first city to be covered by 5G.\nAs proof that the cause of the global pandemic is not debris, Kindracuk points to various scientific investigations into the coronavirus, including the fact researchers have been able to take it apart physically and put the virus sequence back together and use it to infect primates. Prepare to see COVID-19 cases rising.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19, 5G conspiracies and infrastructural futures - PMC\nContent:\nThe main motivation for the protest was that 5G installation went ahead against council opposition, even though the installation was legal and did not require council authority (Bibby, 2020). Protesters blocked access to the site and had to be cleared by police (Bibby, 2020). Unlike celebrities’ social media posts mentioned earlier, no clear links were made to COVID-19. Indeed, ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020b, 2020c) criticised the media for making the link, arguing that ‘we were around long before CV!!’ However, the willingness to breach regulations and hold a large-scale gathering during a pandemic implied that they regarded the risks caused by 5G as of greater significance than coronavirus.\nWhile many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors. Perhaps surprisingly, Australia became something of a global hotspot for these actions, many of which appear to be coordinated (or at least actively supported) by ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020a) and other associated groups (e.g.\nThere are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer.\nThe second and more prominent conspiracy moves well away from these historical concerns with EMF exposure. Instead, it argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19. There are a number of variations around this conspiracy theory. Among the more notable of them are the erroneous claims that (a) COVID-19 is a made up pandemic to cover up the deleterious effects of 5G radiation (Asher Hamilton, 2020a) and (b) that COVID-19 emerged from Wuhan because it had ‘been the guinea-pig city for 5G’ (Adams, 2020).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides context for the claim by discussing the popularity of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology. The notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke is mentioned as having published a video claiming that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology, which reached millions of followers. Chinese state media is also mentioned as having embarked on a concerted effort to present the benefits of 5G technology to a world audience.\n\nInformation 2 discusses Facebook's efforts to combat conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that 5G causes the virus. The article mentions that Facebook has expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus, including those that claim 5G and COVID-19 are related.\n\nInformation 3 provides a social network analysis of the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter. The analysis shows that the conspiracy theory became a trending topic in the UK and that multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking 5G and COVID-19. The analysis also shows that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account named \"5gcoronavirus19,\" which was created in 2012 and had the sole purpose of raising awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G.\n\nInformation 4 debunks the claim that 5G caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The article mentions that cities in South Korea and the US had 5G networks before Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began. The article also mentions that Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network.\n\nInformation 5 discusses the COVID-19, 5G conspiracies and infrastructural futures. The article mentions that while many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a video says COVID-19 is caused by 5G is true.

Surveys conducted across South Africa since the outbreak of COVID-19 demonstrate the complexity of factors that contribute towards VH in this population. Amidst the negative press that the COVID-19 vaccine has received, especially across social media, understanding and combatting VH remains important to achieve herd immunity.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has defined VH as a ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of safe vaccines despite availability of vaccine services’.2 Vaccine hesitancy is a worldwide phenomenon and evidence suggests that it has become more acute in recent years.3,4 In higher income settings such as the United States (US) and Europe, VH has led to vulnerable pools of unimmunised children resulting in large measles outbreaks.5,6 Similarly, across Africa vaccination programmes are challenged by VH, for instance, disinformation and public distrust in vaccination had led to a fivefold increase in polio incidence in Nigeria between 2002 and 2006 and subsequent polio outbreaks across three continents.7 The VH phenomenon is magnified in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency.\nIn the wake of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the practice of ophthalmology has undergone a dramatic and unprecedented shift. The inherent risk of transmission is high due to the need for patient proximity during an ophthalmic exam or surgery, which has led to at least one outbreak in Norway [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. In March 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued practice guidelines and released a list of emergent ophthalmic surgical procedures to be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15]. Subsequently, the rescheduling of routine ocular examinations and limiting procedures to those deemed urgent or emergent has been the basis of many recent publications [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Each has offered specialty specific guidelines to limit transmission moving forward, while allowing for the gradual increase in ophthalmic exams, intraocular injections, and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nAdherence to these recommendations has resulted in an estimated 75% or more reduction of in-person clinic volumes [28]. Concurrently, the implementation of telemedicine visits resulted in an alternative way to provide continued care [3, 25, 29,30,31]. However, the exact reduction of in-patient visits, increase in telemedicine encounters, and the change in the types of diagnoses seen within in an ophthalmology clinic before and after COVID-19 remains unknown. Herein, we describe these changes in clinic volume over all subspecialists in an academic eye clinic as epiphenomena of COVID-19 in ophthalmic practice.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Ophthalmic practice during COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (<strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong>) pandemic has caused significant <strong>changes</strong> in ophthalmic <strong>practice</strong>.
