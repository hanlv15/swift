The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ... First, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The Climate Crisis – A Race We Can Win | United Nations\nContent:\nAccording to a September 2019 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report, we are at least one degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and close to what scientists warn would be “an unacceptable risk”. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement. Climate is a risk multiplier that makes worse already existing challenges.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Our planet is warming.

Combatting the coronavirus pandemic required each one of us to do our part, change our habits and daily routines and make personal sacrifices. If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change. Though invisible, COVID-19 has been seen by most people as a “clear and present danger” to the entire world population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-18, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the coronavirus. It explains that there is no evidence to support this claim, and global warming does not occur quickly enough to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, discusses the importance of addressing climate change despite the ongoing pandemic. It highlights that a majority of people are more worried about climate change now than before the pandemic, and policymakers should enact bold reforms to mitigate its effects. It also emphasizes the need for a strategy to overcome short-termism and ensure a just transition.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, outlines the urgency of addressing climate change. It mentions that global temperatures are already 1° Celsius above preindustrial levels and could rise to above 3° Celsius by 2100 if emissions are not slowed down. It also highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on the world's poorest countries and the need for scalable new technologies and nature-based solutions.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5° F and highlights that we have the technology to do so.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-05, draws parallels between the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. It highlights the need for personal sacrifices and a change in habits to combat the climate crisis.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that we must back away from climate change efforts to protect ourselves from the coronavirus is false. There is no evidence to support the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the virus. In fact, addressing climate change is more important than ever, as highlighted in information 2, 3, and 5. The pandemic has shown that political will and personal sacrifices can lead to significant progress in addressing global threats. The fight against the climate crisis requires similar determination and a shift in habits and daily routines.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Science Feedback (2020-03-18).

Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nVaccines cannot cause infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 or other viruses. They do not affect or interact with our DNA. These vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell where our DNA (genetic material) is located, so it cannot change or influence our genes. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies.\nThis triggers our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to help protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

What caught your eye about the Covid-19 spike protein?  · The spike protein really differentiates this coronavirus from previous ones. We know about the ones that cause SARS or MERS. It’s got these specific, unique sequences at the molecular level that allow it to bind to proteins on the cell surface.\nThis is still a hypothesis, but we think viruses able to trigger neuropilin 1 might be able to dig deeper into tissues without first having to replicate themselves in the upper layer of cells. That would be an amazing bypassing mechanism for a virus.  · Would that make it harder for the immune system to spot them too?  · Exactly. And it would eventually mean the virus spreads quicker. It would help to give it this broad tropism (ability to infect many different organs and tissues) we are seeing in Covid-19 compared to the coronavirus that caused SARS, which doesn’t have that furin cleavage site.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-01-20\nTitle: FALSE: COVID-19 vaccine infects the cells of the human body – ...\nContent:\nExplanation: <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>vaccines</strong> - Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna are mRNA based <strong>vaccines</strong>.

If a person is later exposed to the virus, antibodies and other parts of the immune system can recognize and attack the virus before it can infect healthy cells or cause illness. Traditional vaccines work by giving a person either viral proteins or an inactivated or weakened version of a virus that triggers an immune response. mRNA vaccines do not contain viral material.\nBy injecting cells with a synthetic mRNA that encodes a viral spike protein, an mRNA vaccine can direct human cells to make a viral spike protein and evoke an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the viral material. These viral spike proteins, or antigens, normally coat the surface of the virus and are recognized by antibodies and other immune cells that prepare and protect the body against the virus.\nThe earliest COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines inject cells with instructions to generate a protein that is normally found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\nmRNA vaccines inject cells with instructions to generate a protein that is normally found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  · The protein that the person makes in response to the vaccine can cause an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the CDC, explains how COVID-19 vaccines work. They are given in the upper arm muscle and introduce protein subunits to the body, which nearby cells pick up. The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign and produces an immune response, creating antibodies and activating immune cells. This process helps the body learn to protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccines do not cause infection with the virus or interact with DNA.\n\nInformation 2, from Research and Innovation, discusses how the COVID-19 virus hijacks human cells using a \"doorway\" potentially also used by other deadly viruses. The spike protein is crucial for the virus's ability to infect cells and is the target for vaccines.\n\nInformation 3, published on the same date as the claim, refutes the claim that COVID-19 vaccines infect human cells. The Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based and do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19, so they cannot make people sick with COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4 discusses how the coronavirus infects cells and uses tricks to evade detection.\n\nInformation 5 explains how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. They inject cells with synthetic mRNA that encodes a viral spike protein, which directs human cells to make a viral spike protein and evoke an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the viral material.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that COVID-19 vaccines infect the cells of the human body is false. According to the provided information, COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19 and do not infect human cells. Instead, they introduce protein subunits to the body, which the immune system recognizes as foreign and uses to build protection against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines work by injecting cells with instructions to generate a protein that is normally found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, triggering an immune response.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim is false based on the provided information and general knowledge about vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines, are mRNA-based and do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19. They cannot make people sick with COVID-19. Instead, they introduce protein subunits to the body, which the immune system recognizes as foreign and uses to build protection against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

Given that women have higher levels of Treg cells than men,13 the observation might provide one reason why women have a lower mortality when infected by COVID-19. Based on these findings, we ask three questions. Do patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 illness have lower vitamin D and Treg levels than COVID-19 positive patients whose illness is milder and who remain quarantined at home?\nHowever, in the case of influenza A virus (IAV), exposure to the virus results in the production of memory regulatory T cells (mTregs), which persist in the host.12 In mice exposed to influenza A infection, the infusion of mTregs into their tail vein significantly reduces weight loss and lung pathology (particularly the inflammatory infiltrate), relative to the infusion of Tregs that have not previously been exposed to the virus. This study illustrates the potential efficacy of Tregs in combatting viral infection. Given that women have higher levels of Treg cells than men,13 the observation might provide one reason why women have a lower mortality when infected by COVID-19.\nVitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19.\nThese conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2022-02-15\nTitle: What is the link between vitamin D levels and COVID-19?\nContent:\nPatients with a vitamin D deficiency were 14 times more likely to have a severe or critical case of COVID-19. Additionally, the mortality rate for those with insufficient vitamin D levels was 25.6%, compared with 2.3% among those with adequate levels. To learn more about the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes, we turned to UC Davis Health’s Chief of Infectious Diseases Stuart Cohen.\nIt surely is not a way to treat COVID-19 in and of itself. Vitamin D deficiency is primarily associated with bone health and osteoporosis. There has also been some research that suggests it may also play a role in cardiovascular diseases and has some links to other infections.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D and COVID-19 severity and related mortality: a prospective ...\nContent:\nThe dramatic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, along with its higher morbidity and mortality rates, urged us to investigate the possible mechanisms leading to severe clinical outcomes in the attempt to identify effective treatments [1]. Within this context, we measured 25OHD levels in a series of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from the first pandemic flow, including either mildly-symptomatic subjects or severely symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the latter admitted to hospital because of different degrees of respiratory insufficiency.\nThe hypothesis of a role for vitamin D deficiency in favoring the COVID-19 related respiratory dysfunction is further supported by epidemiologic data showing that the mortality rate of COVID-19 infection between the onset of the first pandemic flow and the summer time was higher (> 10%) in southern European countries [13,14,15], such as Italy and Spain, in which vitamin D deficiency is known to be highly prevalent in the winter season, likely due to the lack of fortification and supplementation policies [36]. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between January and May 2020, has shown a larger diffusion in the Northern hemisphere along the 30–50°N latitude zone, while COVID-19 related mortality, particularly concerning white Caucasian subjects, importantly decreased (around 2–6%) in most countries below the 37°N parallel [37], where the sunlight exposure allows to produce adequate vitamin D levels even in fall and winter seasons [6]. Likewise, death rates have been lower (well below 5%) in\nTable 2 Clinical characteristics of severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital ward or to Intensive Care Unit ... The prevalence rates of vitamin D deficiency were significantly higher in patients requiring ICU admission than in those who did not (Table 2).\nAs is evident, the prevalence of both vitamin D 25OHD < 10 ng/mL and 25OHD between 10 and 20 ng/mL was higher in severely COVID-19 cases (considered as overall group as well as in ICU-admitted and deceased cases) than in mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients or controls, respectively. ... Prevalence rates of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and of severe hypovitaminosis D in mildly-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19), in COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital ward (COVID-19 non-ICU), in COVID-9 patients admitted to intensive care unit (COVID-19 ICU), in COVID-19 patients who died COVID-19 deceased) and in control subjects (matched controls).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Association between vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 infection ...\nContent:\nStill, these results suggest that expansion of vitamin D supplementation may potentially reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Future research is needed to determine the mechanism by which vitamin D supplementation is more effective among Black patients. Baseline vitamin D serum levels and cumulative dosage also moderated the effect of vitamin D3 treatment. Specifically, patients with lower serum levels receiving higher dosages of vitamin D3 experienced the greatest associated reduction in infection.\nBlack patients typically have greater vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection rates and may benefit from supplementation more than patients of other races26. Men have also been found to have lower Vitamin D blood levels than women27. Similarly, patients with lower vitamin D serum levels may benefit from supplementation more than patients with higher levels. Further, patients receiving higher dosages are more likely to increase their serum levels to levels necessary for protection against COVID-19 than patients receiving lower dosages28.\nFirst, compared to white patients, Black patients supplemented with vitamin D3 experienced a greater associated reduction in COVID-19 infection rates relative to controls than white patients (29% decrease versus an 18% decrease). Lower serum levels of vitamin D did not explain this finding. Still, these results suggest that expansion of vitamin D supplementation may potentially reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Future research is needed to determine the mechanism by which vitamin D supplementation is more effective among Black patients.\nAlternatively, supplemented patients may be more likely to live in colder climates where vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 rates were elevated in 2020. There are also many important factors we were unable to control for in our statistical analysis that are associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality, including socioeconomic status and weight/obesity. Still, these concerns are lessened by the significant associations between low vitamin D serum levels and higher average and cumulative dosages with improved outcomes.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Low vitamin D levels do not aggravate COVID-19 risk or death, and ...\nContent:\nFor example, several studies have shown that the death rate for black patients with COVID-19 was higher than the rate for white patients with COVID-19 [33, 34]. Second, many factors modulate vitamin D status, including genetic polymorphisms, age, health, sun exposure behavior, and season [11]. Although we included only studies that performed multivariable analysis, some potential risk factors were not fully adjusted, which affected our results. Therefore, further research should adjust for additional confounding factors to verify the results. Based on current evidence, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was not significantly linked to susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or its associated death.\nThese results suggest that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 infection rates and worse outcomes. Several studies have reported that serum vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 positivity and worse outcomes (e.g., severe COVID-19 and in-hospital death) [3,4,5]. However, a larger cohort-based study from the UK Biobank showed a nonsignificant association after adjustment for confounders (COVID-19 infection HR: 1.00; p = 0.89; death HR: 0.98; p = 0.69) [6]. Two other studies also found no association between vitamin D and COVID-19 positivity [7, 8]. Therefore, the impact of vitamin D on COVID-19 risk and clinical outcomes remains controversial, and a definite conclusion has not been reached.\nOur results also support the recommendation of joint guidance of insufficient evidence of vitamin D for the treatment of COVID-19 [30]. Although a small random controlled trial showed that oral vitamin D supplementation helped achieve SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity in greater proportion and decreased inflammatory markers [21], we did not find a significant benefit of vitamin D supplements by combining available evidence from RCTs on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, which was consistent with two quasi-experimental studies [31, 32]. The overall quality of evidence for death or ICU admission was low, suggesting no recombination of vitamin D supplementation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, all of the trials included a low or unclear percentage of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. The benefits of vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency should be further studied. Further studies with higher quality should also determine whether prev\nTherefore, further research should adjust for additional confounding factors to verify the results. Based on current evidence, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was not significantly linked to susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or its associated death. Vitamin D supplements did not significantly improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and the overall GRADE evidence quality was low, which suggested that vitamin D supplementation was not recommended for patients with COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, discusses the potential role of Treg cells and vitamin D in combating viral infections, including COVID-19. It highlights the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19 patients. The article also mentions the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the severity of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2022, states that patients with vitamin D deficiency were 14 times more likely to have a severe or critical case of COVID-19, and the mortality rate for those with insufficient vitamin D levels was 25.6%, compared to 2.3% among those with adequate levels.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, presents a study that found a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe COVID-19 cases, particularly those admitted to the ICU or those who died from the disease.\n\nInformation 4, also without a specific publication date, discusses the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in reducing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.

Information 1 and 3 provide evidence of a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of COVID-19, while Information 2 and 4 support the claim that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality.

The number of Covid patients in hospitals is an indicator of Covid’s ongoing impact on hospitals and I.C.U.s.\nNotes: Figures for Covid patients in hospitals and I.C.U.s are the most recent number of patients with Covid-19 who are hospitalized or in an intensive care unit on that day. Dips and spikes could be due to inconsistent reporting by hospitals. Hospitalization numbers early in the pandemic are undercounts due to incomplete reporting by hospitals to the federal government. The C.D.C. stopped reporting data on cases in May 2023. Test positivity is based on tests that laboratories voluntarily reported to the federal government.

Consistent use of a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio = 0.44).\nThe use of face masks or respirators (N95/KN95) is recommended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Well-fitting face masks and respirators effectively filter virus-sized particles in laboratory conditions (2,3), though few studies have assessed their real-world effectiveness in preventing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4).\nFace mask or respirator use was assessed among 652 case-participants (residents who had received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2) and 1,176 matched control-participants (residents who had received negative test results for SARS-CoV-2) who self-reported being in indoor public settings during the 2 weeks preceding testing and who reported no known contact with anyone with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection during this time.

Wearing face masks has been widely advocated to mitigate transmission. Masks are thought to protect people in two ways: (i) source control, reducing the emission and spread of respiratory viruses through airborne droplets and aerosols, and (ii) wearer protection, reducing the inhalation of airborne respiratory viruses. The effectiveness of masks, however, is still under debate. Compared with N95 or FFP2 respirators, which have very low particle penetration rates (~5%), surgical and similar masks exhibit higher and more variable penetration rates (~30 to 70%) (2, 3).\nFace masks are highly effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission because, in most environments, airborne virus abundance is limited.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How effective is a mask in preventing COVID‐19 infection? - PMC\nContent:\nN95 masks are one of the most common air filtering respirators which are currently in high demand during the COVID‐19 pandemic. N95 is a test standard of the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) air filtration rating, which provides the classification of filtering respirators (CDC, 2020). According to the standards of NIOSH, filtering respirators can be classified as the N95, N99 and N100 masks, which can respectively block at least 95%, 99% and 99.97% of particles with median diameter of 0.3 μm from entering (CDC, 2020).\nThe role of community‐wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic due to SARS‐CoV‐2.

Terms searched were “face masks”, “surgical mask” and “N95” in combination with the terms “risk” and “adverse effects” as well as “side effects”. The selection criteria of the papers were based on our above definition of risk and adverse effect of masks.\nIn a laboratory experiment (evidence level IIa study), it was demonstrated that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses using virus-free aerosols [118]. In this study, the FFP2-equivalent N95 mask performed significantly better in protection (8–12 times more effective) than the surgical mask, but neither mask type established reliable, hypothesis-generated protection against corona and influenza viruses. Both mask types could be penetrated unhindered by aerosol particles with a diameter of 0.08 to 0.2 μm. Both the SARS-CoV-2 pathogens with a size of 0.06 to 0.14 μm [119] and the influenza viruses with 0.08 to 0.12 μm are unfortunately well below the mask pore sizes [118].\nKeywords: personal protective equipment, masks, N95 face mask, surgical mask, risk, adverse effects, long-term adverse effects, contraindications, health risk assessment, hypercapnia, hypoxia, headache, dyspnea, physical exertion, MIES syndrome · At the beginning of the spread of the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2, it was necessary to make far-reaching decisions even without available explicit scientific data.\nAt least Germany pointed out that wearers of certain types of masks such as the common fabric masks (community masks) cannot rely on them to protect them or others from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [114]. However, scientists not only complain about the lack of evidence for fabric masks in the scope of a pandemic [16,110], but also about the high permeability of fabric masks with particles and the potential risk of infection they pose [108,109]. Ordinary fabric masks with a 97% penetration for particle dimensions of ≥0.3 μm are in stark contrast to medical-type surgical masks with a 44% penetration. In contrast, the N95 mask has a penetration rate of less than 0.01% for particles ≥ 0.3 μm in the laboratory experiment [108,115].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: An evidence review of face masks against COVID-19 | Proceedings ...\nContent:\nMa et al., Exhaled breath is a significant source of SARS-CoV-2 emission. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20115154 (2 June 2020). ...

Influenza Other Respiratory Viruses 14, 365–373 (2020).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2022-02-10, is a study on the effectiveness of face masks or respirators in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study found that consistent use of face masks or respirators, including N95/KN95, in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, discusses the effectiveness of masks in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, stating that masks are highly effective in most environments because airborne virus abundance is limited. Compared to N95 or FFP2 respirators, surgical and similar masks exhibit higher and more variable penetration rates.\n\nInformation 3, also with no specific publication date, focuses on N95 masks and their effectiveness in filtering particles, including those of SARS-CoV-2. N95 masks can block at least 95% of particles with a median diameter of 0.3 μm.\n\nInformation 4, published up to and including 2020-10-31, is a review of scientific studies and publications on adverse effects and risks of different types of mouth-nose-covering masks. The review found that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses using virus-free aerosols.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a review of evidence on face masks against COVID-19. The review states that exhaled breath is a significant source of SARS-CoV-2 emission and that normal speaking produces thousands of oral fluid particles, including aerosols and droplets, that can harbor respiratory pathogens.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published on 2020-06-01, states that scientific studies have found the use of N95 face masks to be ineffective in restricting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that the lack of oxygen from using the mask causes severe respiratory problems.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nThe claim is false based on the available information and current scientific knowledge. The studies and information presented show that N95 masks are effective in filtering virus-sized particles and reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is no evidence to support the claim that the lack of oxygen from using N95 masks causes severe respiratory problems. In fact, Information 4 states that both surgical masks and N95 masks have deficits in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, but it does not support the claim that N95 masks are ineffective in restricting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, Information 1 specifically found that consistent use of N95 masks in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Therefore, the claim is false based on the available information and current scientific knowledge.", "response": "FALSE."}

Elissa Nadworny/NPR · People who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, shed virus particles through their feces when they go to the bathroom. Wastewater monitoring provides an early opportunity to catch the virus because it can detect an infection days before respiratory symptoms show up, and even if they never show up at all in the case of asymptomatic individuals.\nAccording to an analysis by NPR, Bruder's small private college in Colorado Springs is one of more than 65 U.S. colleges testing wastewater in an effort to monitor coronavirus spread. And that number is growing. ... Colorado College mathematics professor Andrea Bruder suits up before descending into the tunnels below South Hall. Like so many faculty and staff members at U.S. colleges, she's redirected her research to focus on COVID-19.\nSome colleges outsource this step, but CSU has the space and lab machines to run the analysis in-house. Elissa Nadworny/NPR · \"We're constantly adjusting our testing protocol based on what the wastewater data is telling us about where we might find the next outbreak beginning,\" explains De Long.\nMiroslav Kummel passes off a wastewater sample from the tunnels under South Hall at Colorado College. Elissa Nadworny/NPR · In her 11 years on campus, Bruder had no reason to know about the dorm sewage lines — much of her research focused on ladybugs and aphids on yucca plants. But like so many faculty and staff members at U.S. colleges, she's redirected her research to focus on COVID-19, using her expertise to keep the campus safe. With just two testing sites, the operation is still small, and the college hasn't yet invested in a 24-hour pump, like CSU has.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Colleges Testing Wastewater to Find COVID Early - WebMD\nContent:\n<strong>COVID</strong>-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

As more students return to more colleges, sewage testing may be a welcome bright spot.\nFreedman added that testing wastewater is a relatively inexpensive way to detect the virus. Clemson is paying Sirem $450 for each sewage test, he said, and has budgeted $70,000 for the fall semester. Colleges should theoretically have to perform many fewer sewage tests than individual clinical tests in order to detect the virus.\nAs more students return to more colleges, sewage testing may be a welcome bright spot. ... This detection method could be particularly useful because the virus shows up in people’s feces about a week before they start showing symptoms of Covid-19. (Both people who tested positive in Likins Hall were asymptomatic, Pepper said.)\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-05-17\nTitle: Wastewater Surveillance Effective in Efforts to Detect COVID on ...\nContent:\nWastewater monitoring helped these colleges detect, contain and prevent wider spread of COVID infection and the findings could provide a blueprint for other institutions – like nursing homes, workplaces, and jails – and inform community efforts to monitor for COVID and other infectious diseases.  · People infected with COVID may shed the virus in their feces even if they have no symptoms. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not known to survive long in wastewater, genetic material from the virus can be detected in sewage for many days.\nDespite these differences, all of the case study colleges found value in sampling wastewater and planned to continue through spring 2021 to help inform efforts to control COVID on campus. For example, in August 2020, the University of Arizona announced it had detected SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater from a student dormitory. Follow up testing identified two asymptomatic infected students, who were transferred to an isolation facility, potentially preventing an outbreak of COVID-19 on campus.\nTherefore, measuring the amount of this material in sewage can provide an early indicator of infection trends in the population. State- and national-level systems for wastewater surveillance at municipal wastewater treatment plants are rapidly developing. Many municipalities in New York have monitored their wastewater. Monroe County conducted sampling between July and December 2020 at Frank E. Van Lare Wastewater Treatment Plant. Meanwhile, colleges and universities across the country have been integrating wastewater surveillance into their ongoing efforts to manage COVID on their campuses, including St.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 containment on a college campus via wastewater-based ...\nContent:\nWastewater-based epidemiology has potential as an early-warning tool for determining the presence of COVID-19 in a community. The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission.\nThis case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm.\nIn total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm.

It is used in the treatment of onchocerciasis (river blindness), strongyloidiasis and other diseases caused by soil transmitted helminthiasis.\nA guideline development group was convened in response to the increased international attention on ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19. This group is an independent, international panel of experts, which includes clinical care experts in multiple specialties and also include an ethicist and patient-partners.\nThey determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” due to the small sizes and methodological limitations of available trial data, including small number of events.\nThe current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false. These claims have been consistently debunked by multiple sources and there is no evidence to support them.", "response": "FALSE."}

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)). Human convalescent sera (HCS) were obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 d after PCR-confirmed diagnosis and at a time when acute COVID-19 symptoms had resolved (n = 38). The HCS panel is a benchmark for serology studies in this Article and previous publications1,2,3. a, Concentrations (in arbitrary units) of IgG that binds recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (lower limit of detection (LLOD) = 1.72 U ml−1). b, SARS-CoV-2 50% virus-neutralization titres (VNT50) (LLOD = 20). c, d, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on days 0, 14, 28 and 42 after first injection of BNT162b2 were restimulated ex vivo with full-length S peptide mix.\nThe histopathology of necropsy specimens obtained 7–8 days after challenge revealed localized areas of pulmonary inflammation that were limited in extent even in the control macaques challenged after mock immunization with saline (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.\nWe conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccines BNT162b1 or BNT162b2—lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode secreted, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or prefusion-stabilized S, respectively—induce strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice and macaques.\nTherefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19 vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses. Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

Research with animals connects these vaccines with other SARS-CoV-2 scientific advancements just as it has made connections among NPRC HIV/AIDS studies, the results from which facilitated the rapid pace to COVID-19 discoveries.\nBut if everyone knew how critical animals have been in 2020 to fast-track a safe and effective COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine, would that change? Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) called upon the National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) – as NIH has for HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika and other infectious disease threats – to identify animal species for studying the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developing safe and effective vaccines to block it.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: Experimental NIH Sudan virus vaccine protects macaques | National ...\nContent:\nA National Institutes of Health research group with extensive experience studying ebolavirus countermeasures has successfully developed a vaccine against Sudan virus (SUDV) based on the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine.

This is in line with the information presented in Information 1 and 2, both of which report on studies showing that COVID-19 vaccine candidates are effective in protecting rhesus macaques from the virus. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely true.\n\nIt is worth noting that the studies reported in Information 1 and 2 were conducted in the early stages of COVID-19 vaccine development, and the vaccines have since undergone further testing and have been shown to be effective in humans as well. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which were tested on rhesus macaques, have been approved for emergency use in humans and have been shown to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

An abortion is defined as a medical procedure to end a pregnancy.\nThe number of abortions occurring worldwide over two days is roughly 400,000, based on annual estimates from between 2015 and 2019 from a study published in July 2020 in the journal The Lancet Global Health. Although the global number of abortions carried out over two days did exceed the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported in March 2020, when this claim surfaced, the number of deaths from COVID-19 has been growing steadily over time.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-01-13\nTitle: Abortion in the U.S.: What the data says | Pew Research Center\nContent:\nSince then, abortions have generally decreased at what a CDC analysis called “a slow yet steady pace.” · Guttmacher recorded more than 1.5 million abortions in the U.S. in 1991, about two-thirds more than the 930,160 it reported for 2020. The CDC reported just over 1 million abortions in 1991 and 620,327 in 2020, looking at just the District of Columbia and the 47 states that reported figures in both years.\nA quarter of women who had abortions in 2020 had one previous live birth, 20% had two previous live births, 10% had three, and 6% had four or more previous live births. These CDC figures include data from 42 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York). The vast majority of abortions occur during the first trimester of a pregnancy.\nIn 2020, 93% of abortions occurred during the first trimester – that is, at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to the CDC. An additional 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, and 1% were performed at 21 weeks or more of gestation. These CDC figures include data from 40 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York).\nSome examples included providing additional state funds for women’s travel expenses and for abortion clinics that were expecting more out-of-state patients. In the 46 states that reported data to the CDC in 2020, the majority of women who had abortions (57%) were in their 20s, while about three-in-ten (31%) were in their 30s.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality - PMC\nContent:\nMore than one-third of all pregnancies are unintended, and 1 in 5 ends in abortion. In developing countries, two-thirds of unintended pregnancies occur among women who were not using any method of contraception.9 Greater contraceptive access and use alone can thus drastically reduce safe and unsafe abortion by reducing unintended pregnancies.\nUnsafe abortion is thus a pressing issue. Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion—less restrictive abortion laws and greater contraceptive use—face social, religious, and political obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions (97%) occur.\nThe median rate of unsafe abortions in the 82 countries with the most restrictive abortion laws is up to 23 of 1000 women compared with 2 of 1000 in nations that allow abortions.4 Abortion-related deaths are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (34 deaths per 100,000 childbirths) than in countries with less restrictive laws (1 or fewer per 100,000 childbirths).1\nLess restrictive abortion laws do not appear to entail more abortions overall. The world’s lowest abortion rates are in Europe, where abortion is legal and widely available but contraceptive use is high; in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, the rate is below 10 per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-11-25\nTitle: Abortion\nContent:\nOf all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e., by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods.Developing countries bear the burden of 97% of all unsafe abortions. More than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia.\nMore than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. In Latin American and Africa, the majority (approximately 3 out of 4) of all abortions are unsafe. In Africa, nearly half of all abortions occur under the least safe circumstances (2).\nThe legal status of abortion can also affect children’s educational outcomes, and their earnings on the labour market later in life. For example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7).\nFor example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7). Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions (1); however, it does affect whether the abortions that women and girls attain are safe and dignified.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-09-25, explains that the claim is false. The number of abortions worldwide over two days is roughly 400,000 based on estimates from 2015-2019. However, the number of COVID-19 deaths has been growing steadily over time and exceeded the 400,000 mark in June 2020. Information 2, also published on 2020-09-25, confirms the findings of Information 1. It mentions that similar posts comparing the total number of deaths from COVID-19 with the number of abortions have circulated since at least March 2020. Information 3, published on 2023-01-13, provides data on abortions in the U.S. but does not contain information relevant to the claim. Information 4, publication date not available, discusses unsafe abortions and their impact on maternal mortality, but it does not contain information relevant to the claim. Information 5, published on 2021-11-25, provides information on unsafe abortions and their impact on children's educational outcomes, but it does not contain information relevant to the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Information 1 and 2, the claim is false as the number of COVID-19 deaths exceeded the number of abortions over two days in June 2020.", "response": "FALSE."}

The mRNA technology is compared to a computer's operating system, but it does not mean that any electronic device is inserted into the human body. The mRNA vaccines do not have an impact on human DNA, as they do not enter the cell nucleus where genetic material is kept. Moreover, 80% of vaccinated people did not experience clinical side effects; severe side effects were rare, and the efficacy of the vaccines was about 95%.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, mentions that the myth about mRNA vaccines affecting genetic code is still circulating online and clarifies that the chance of this happening is next to zero.\n\nInformation 3, also with no specific publication date, is an AP News article addressing false claims that COVID-19 vaccines alter humans' DNA, which have circulated before their debut in late 2020.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-05-08, is an article by the Australian Government's Department of Health stating that COVID-19 vaccines do not alter human DNA.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a MedlinePlus Genetics article explaining that mRNA vaccines use a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a protein on a virus and that vaccines for COVID-19 are the only mRNA vaccines authorized or approved by the FDA.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe claim that Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are obtained through a combination of gene synthesis and DNA technology and that they change coding in a human gene is false. The vaccines are mRNA vaccines, which do not affect human DNA, as they do not enter the cell nucleus. The claim that 80% of vaccinated people experienced clinical side effects is also false, as severe side effects were rare, and the efficacy of the vaccines was about 95%. The information provided in the claim is incorrect and misleading.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-01-22, while the fact-check article by Myth Detector, which debunks the claim, was also published on the same date. Therefore, the fact-check article is more reliable and up-to-date than the claim. Additionally, the claim contains incorrect information about the impact of mRNA vaccines on human DNA and the percentage of vaccinated people who experienced clinical side effects. The other sources of information, including the MedlinePlus Genetics article, the AP News article, and the Australian Government's Department of Health article, also support the fact-check article's conclusion that the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Wash your hands frequently. Use soap and water if available, otherwise sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol will work. Wash for at least 20 seconds. Frequently clean and disinfect high touch surfaces like doorknobs, countertops and your cell phone. Avoid contact with those infected. We know, it’s not the most exciting bit of information -- but those are the only scientifically proven ways to help protect yourself against COVID-19.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has already issued warning letters to several essential oil companies warning them to stop saying their products can help against COVID-19. MYTH: Spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will stop you from getting coronavirus. FACT: Don’t do that. It’s not good for you. There are two different sanitizing methods out there. Hand sanitizers are meant for the body and are designed specifically to come into contact with human skin. They’re regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of that. Disinfectants, however, are meant to only be used on surfaces and on inanimate objects -- not the human body.\nFACT: There’s no evidence that this is true, although the World Health Organization does note that there is limited evidence that this can help you recover more quickly from the common cold (not COVID-19). Regular saline rinses have not yet been shown to prevent respiratory infections. MYTH: Antibiotics will help you against coronavirus. FACT: Antibiotics do not fight viral infections, they’re used to treat bacterial ones. Coronavirus is a virus, and thus not weak to antibiotics. MYTH: Getting a flu shot or a pneumonia vaccine will stop you from getting coronavirus. FACT: While neither will stop you from becoming sick from COVID-19, they are definitely worth getting, especially if you’re elderly according to Dr.\nMYTH: Hot air from a sauna or hair dryer will kill COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: True Or False: Using A Blow Dryer In Your Sinuses Will Kill ...\nContent:\nThough contact with alcohol-based cleaning wipes will kill COVID-19 on surfaces, consuming alcohol will not prevent the virus from spreading inside your respiratory system. What’s more, excessive alcohol consumption can weaken your immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off the virus. 2. Using a blow dryer to shoot hot air into your sinuses will kill the new coronavirus.\nThis is dangerously false. Studies underway involving chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not yet reached any conclusions and the FDA has not approved the drugs for use in treating COVID-19. If not taken in proper doses, these drugs can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.\nThough videos demonstrating and promoting this practice are circulating on the Internet, there is no evidence that the hot air generated by a dryer will kill the coronavirus. What’s more, the mucus found in our noses traps dust and other particles we inhale as part of our body’s disease defense system. Drying your nose out too much could be harmful to your overall health. 3. Bananas can help your body fight the coronavirus. FALSE.

The coronavirus does not just sit idle in your nasal passages or throat. Viruses invade normal cells and use those cells to multiply.\nThe best use of those agents is in a clinical trial protocol so we can determine their safety and efficacy. We have those protocols at UT Southwestern. There have been reports of people using fish tank cleaning products that contain chloroquine phosphate to treat COVID-19, but those products are not intended for human use and can be poisonous if not used correctly.\nFood and Drug Administration has approved investigational use of convalescent plasma, which can be donated by somebody who has recovered from COVID-19 and has built up antibodies to the virus in hopes their plasma will stimulate a stronger immune response in a patient still battling the infection.\nViruses invade normal cells and use those cells to multiply. And hot water doesn’t begin to kill bacteria until it reaches at least 140 degrees – a temperature that would scald your skin. That’s one reason proper handwashing recommendations don’t include using hot water. The CDC has also said there is no evidence COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools, hot tubs, or spas as long as they’re properly maintained.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, states that there is no evidence to support the claim that using hot air from a hair dryer on sinuses can prevent or treat COVID-19. It also mentions that directing hot air to sinuses can make them dry and cause tiny tears, which may increase the risk of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-26, reaffirms the information from Information 1, stating that there is absolutely no evidence that heat can prevent or treat COVID-19. A coronavirus expert and a cell biologist have both confirmed that this method would not be effective.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-23, focuses on debunking myths related to COVID-19. Among the debunked myths is the claim that hot air from a sauna or hair dryer will kill COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, but it also debunks the myth that hot air from a hair dryer will kill COVID-19.

Multiple sources, including experts in coronaviruses and cell biology, have confirmed that there is no evidence supporting the claim that using hot air from a hair dryer on sinuses can prevent or treat COVID-19. In fact, doing so could potentially increase the risk of infection by causing tiny tears in the sinuses.

Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: San José del Guaviare Jorge E.

As the risk of developing severe, and even potentially fatal, COVID-19-associated pneumonia is extremely high in patients harboring auto-Abs against type I IFN, eliminating these auto-Abs by TPE emerges as an attractive additional line of treatment.\nPrimary outcomes were mortality at 35 days post ICU admission and safety of TPE in life-threatening COVID-19. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed no significant effect of TPE on 35-day survival after adjustment for relevant confounders, therefore aligning with the results of the present study.

Many articles and posts cite the article by McCullough et al. as a “study”, claiming “the study found that immediate use of hydroxychloroquine, while the patient was still at home, showed significant benefits”. This article focuses on early treatment strategies that can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.\nGiven that hydroxychloroquine has shown no beneficial effect in COVID-19 patients, the scientific evidence doesn’t support the claim that widespread use of the drug could have saved lives.

Furthermore, the data presented here did not show any excess in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in the hydroxychloroquine group. These findings indi\nA review of Covid-19 treatment guidelines that was produced early in the pandemic showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was recommended in China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and South Korea.37 In the United States, the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was permitted in certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A retrospective cohort study involving 1376 patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to the hospital in New York City in March and April 2020 showed that 59% of the patients received hydroxychloroquine.22,38 Since our preliminary results were made public on June 5, 2020, the FDA has revoked the EUA for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,39 and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health have ceased trials of its use in hospitalized patients on the grounds of a lack of benefit.\nHowever, in a substantial proportion of infected persons, the infection leads to a respiratory illness requiring hospital care,2 which can progress to critical illness with hypoxemic respiratory failure and lead to prolonged ventilatory support.3-6 Among the patients with Covid-19 who have been admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom, the case fatality rate is approximately 30%.7 · Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two 4-aminoquinoline drugs that were developed more than 70 years ago and have been used to treat malaria and rheumatologic conditions, have been proposed as treatments for Covid-19. Chloroquine has been shown to have in vitro activity against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV-1.8-13 The exact mechanism of antiviral action is uncertain, but these drugs increase the pH of endosomes that the virus uses for cell entry and also interfere with the glycosylation of angiotensin-converting–enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the cellular receptor of SAR\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Hydroxychloroquine is effective, and consistently so when provided ...\nContent:\nNo mortality or serious safety adverse events were found.

The claim that the federal government is preparing to forcibly intern Canadians is patently false, the spokesperson said. The federal government has announced funding for voluntary quarantine sites for some of the country's homeless and has made plans to expand self-isolation capacity for returning international travellers without suitable places to go, but Canadians will not be compelled to leave their homes for so-called COVID \"camps.\"\nHealth Minister Patty Hajdu announced funding for Toronto to establish a quarantine site for homeless people who have tested positive for COVID-19. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) No one will be required to go to such an isolation site, Health Canada confirmed Tuesday. In addition to such voluntary sites for vulnerable people, the federal government has a mandatory quarantine policy in place for most returning international travellers.

The data included in the paper covered the first 56 days of the trial and is ongoing.\nProfessor Wei Chen, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, China, says: “Since elderly individuals face a high risk of serious illness and even death associated with COVID-19 infection, they are an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. It is possible that an additional dose may be needed in order to induce a stronger immune response in the elderly population, but further research is underway to evaluate this.” [2] The authors note that the trial was conducted in Wuhan, China, and the baseline immunity is representative of Chinese adults at that time, but other countries may have different rates of immunity which should be considered.\nThe report shows the vaccine candidate generated an immune response, making antibodies and stimulating T-cells to fight COVID-19. We don’t know exactly what protects us against a coronavirus infection, as there is still so much we don’t know, so our research continues. While the race for a vaccine against this virus is moving quicker than we’ve ever seen before, and the global need for a vaccine is evident, we can never forget safety is still of the highest importance. While these are hopeful results, there’s still a long way to go before we have a viable vaccine at our fingertips.\nIn 'blind' trials, participants do not know which group they are in; in ‘double blind’ trials, the experimenters do not know either.

Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nOf the initial group of 68 who were accepted for the trial, 56% were infected with rhinovirus and 31% with coronaviruses. The remainder were infected with enterovirus, influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. A total of 54 individuals completed the controlled trial. The control group treated the cold as they normally would. The other group was asked to do a salt water gargle and rinse their nasal passages with a salt solution at will.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-07\nTitle: New Study: Gargling with Salt Water May Help Prevent Covid ...\nContent:\nIntroduction: Saline nasal irrigation and gargling improve respiratory symptoms associated with coronavirus infection.

The World Health Organization has stated that there is currently no cure for Covid-19, and no way to increase body temperature to kill the virus. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect against Covid-19 is by frequently cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. While some traditional remedies, such as inhaling steam, may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild Covid-19, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that they can prevent or cure the disease.

Probably Not, ...\nContent:\nWithout being alarmist, the rising temperatures mean the inside of your car will get hot very quickly—so don't leave a bottle of hand sanitizer in there, just in case. ... The fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode.\nIf you're carrying alcohol-based hand sanitizer wherever you go, congratulations—it's what we've been advised to do by public-health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic. However, don't leave it inside your car, because the very alcohol that helps kill germs is also very flammable.\nThe fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode. Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid \"which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-05-28\nTitle: Can hand sanitiser catch fire in a hot car? - Full Fact\nContent:\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363°C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side. So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire. But that doesn’t mean hand sanitiser left in a car that gets warmer than this will ignite on its own, unless there is a spark.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-05-22\nTitle: Will Hand Sanitizer Combust If Left in a Hot Car? | Snopes.com\nContent:\nIt tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel. Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes: ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid.\n\"Deixar Alcool Em Gel No Console Exposto ao Sol Faz o Carro Pegar Fogo?\" Quatro Rodas. 20 April 2020.

A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we've yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way.\nSoon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak. There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.", "response": "FALSE."}

It works by instructing the body to produce a protein found on the surface of the corona virus. The immune system then learns how to recognize and produce antibodies against that protein.” · We also asked experts from the Clinical Centre of Montenegro (KCCG) whether the vaccine against COVID-19 can modify human DNA.\nThe materials that make up the coronavirus vaccine are based on ribonucleic acids (RNA), and when they enter the body, they do not penetrate the nucleus at all, so they do not have a chance of coming into contact with the hereditary material contained in it; therefore, we conclude that vaccination will not cause any harm to the body, especially in terms of changing the structure of the DNA chain. Having considered the facts and evidence in the form of the views and statements of experts, we have come to the conclusion that the information regarding harmful effects of the vaccine against COVID-19 on human DNA is unfounded and untrue.\nTo determine whether the information published in the media and on social networks is true, we were engaged to check posts, one of which was a statement that the coronavirus vaccine changes human DNA. The World Health Organization was the first to respond to this statement with the explanation: “COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously tested for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a long-lasting immune response.\n\nSummary of the Information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-08, is from FactCheck Georgia. It states that there is no evidence that COVID-19 RNA vaccines can alter human DNA or introduce non-human/animal DNA into human bodies. Also, the Microsoft and Bill Gates patent for a system that rewards physical activity with cryptocurrency does not mention implanted microchips or nanoparticles for collecting biometric data.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-05-08, is from the Australian Government's Department of Health. It reaffirms that COVID-19 vaccines do not alter human DNA.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-11-13, is from BOOM, an Indian fact-checking website. It clarifies that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation owns a patent for a cryptocurrency system that rewards physical activity, but it does not involve microchips, nanoparticles, or the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 4, with no publication date, is from the National Library of Medicine. It discusses the potential health risks of mRNA-based vaccine therapy but does not mention any alteration of human DNA.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, is from UNICEF. It explains that the COVID-19 vaccine does not change human DNA, as the materials used in the vaccine do not penetrate the nucleus and cannot come into contact with the hereditary material.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nGiven the available information, the claim that COVID-19 RNA vaccines alter human DNA and can turn humans into chimeras is false. This is consistent with information 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, all of which state that COVID-19 vaccines do not alter human DNA. Information 1 and 3 specifically debunk the claim about nanoparticles acting as antennas for collecting biometric data for cryptocurrency.\n\nThe claim about nanoparticles acting as antennas for collecting biometric data for cryptocurrency is also false. Information 1 and 3 explicitly state that there is no evidence of nanoparticles or microchips in the vaccines for this purpose.\n\nThe claim about COVID-19 RNA vaccines introducing non-human/animal DNA into human bodies is also false. Information 1, 3, and 5 state that the vaccines do not introduce non-human DNA into human bodies.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false based on the available information and current scientific understanding.", "response": "FALSE."}

The key findings of the review include:\n\n1. Long Covid may consist of four different syndromes, which can affect various body systems, including respiratory, heart, urinary, brain, skin, gut, and muscle and joint systems.\n2. These syndromes can occur in people with varying severity of initial COVID-19 infection, from mild to severe cases.\n3. The four syndromes include post-intensive care syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome, permanent organ damage, and long-term COVID syndrome. Some patients may experience one or more syndromes simultaneously.\n4. The lack of distinction between these syndromes may contribute to challenges faced by patients in being believed and accessing appropriate healthcare services.\n5. The ongoing after-effects of COVID-19 may not be a single illness but rather a combination of these four syndromes.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nGiven the information provided, the claim is accurate.

The test can be performed in environments where the patient specimen is both collected and analyzed, such as doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, using an instrument about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage.\nThe performance of the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer was validated in a large study of 2,409 individuals, including those with and without symptoms. In the study, the test was shown to have 91.2% sensitivity (the percent of positive samples the test correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the percent of negative samples the test correctly identified).\nWhen the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer detects the presence of VOC markers of SARS-CoV-2, a presumptive (unconfirmed) positive test result is returned and should be confirmed with a molecular test. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as they do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions.\nInspectIR expects to be able to produce approximately 100 instruments per week, which can each be used to evaluate approximately 160 samples per day.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19.

America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

As suggested in the apt title of a recent paper by Platje et al. (2020), the COVID‐19 pandemic appears to have been “both an expected and unexpected event.” However, many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration's response were not only foreseeable but were, in fact, foreseen.\nTrump, sobered by worst‐case scenario death projections (McGraw & Oprysko, 2020), accepted Fauci and Birx's public health framing that a shutdown was needed to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed and save lives (White House, 2020h). Trump was then persuaded to extend the shutdown for an additional 30 days. In addition to the shutdown, to cope with the economic fallout of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Trump supported, and, on March 27, 2020, signed into law, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) (AJMC, 2021).\nIn the US alone, the horrifying costs of the pandemic can be measured in the millions of Americans infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the many hundreds of thousands confirmed dead with or from COVID‐19 to date (Johns Hopkins University, 2022). While the pandemic came as a rude awakening to many nonspecialists, the predominant view among health security professionals was that the question was not whether but when the next major pandemic or public health emergency would strike. Yet, despite these insights, decades of preparedness work, and considerable investment, President Trump, in March 2020, claimed, “Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\nWarnings were regularly made in the media (e.g., Yong, 2018), by prominent individuals, such as Bill Gates in a widely viewed 2015 TED talk, and by Trump's own experts, who predicted, based on a 2019 influenza simulation, that the US would be underprepared, underfunded, and would be unable to respond effectively to a pandemic. With over 400,000 deaths in the US as a result of COVID‐19, at the time Trump left office, this assessment appears tragically prescient. Multiple studies have concluded that many of the deaths in the US were avoidable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-19\nTitle: AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s virus revisionism; Biden on the hoax | ...\nContent:\nThe institute now forecasts more than 378,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by Jan. 1. In early April, U.S. officials estimated at least 100,000 would die from the pandemic even if all conceivable steps were taken against it — a thorough and enduring lockdown, full use of masks and more. A death toll up to 240,000 assumed aggressive mitigation. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so — a number that puts the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\nFirst and most notably, the U.S. is not running “substantially” below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Tens of thousands of new infections are being reported each day. The White House and federal public health authorities have often pointed to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington as a source for their pandemic projections.

This is factually wrong, disingenuous, immoral and disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working every day to defeat this virus. It completely ignores the real, successful efforts by the Trump administration to save lives.\nBiden, Harris, Democrats and the media may continue to lie about COVID-19. But in the end, the American people will recognize the lives which have been saved and the real efforts which have been made to save them. The virus has tragically killed 214,000 Americans. President Trump—and the brave men and women in our public health system—have saved 2 million.\nIn fact, Biden already has a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics—his previous tenure as vice president is part of the reason federal agencies were strapped for resources at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In May, his own former chief of staff, Ron Klain, told Politico it was \"purely a fortuity\" that the Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 outbreak didn't turn out to be \"one of the great mass casualty events in American history.\" Klain continued, \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck.\" We don't need to ask Biden how he would have dealt with the current pandemic, because we know how badly he handled the last major viral event.\nIn the first two debates of the 2020 presidential contest, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 99.997% of individuals aged 19 and younger who contract coronavirus make a full recovery, 99.98% of those aged 20 to 49 make a full recovery, and 99.5% aged 50 to 69 fully recover.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains that the COVID-19 pandemic was both expected and unexpected, and that many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration’s response were foreseeable and foreseen. Trump was persuaded to extend the shutdown and supported a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill. Despite warnings and preparedness work, Trump claimed in March 2020 that nobody knew there would be a pandemic of this proportion.\n\nInformation 3, published on September 19, 2020, states that the U.S. is not running substantially below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19.

And at the time, Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people in the trial were likely to have encounters with non-mask wearers.For more, see \"Danish Study Doesn’t Prove Masks Don’t Work Against the Coronavirus,\" Nov.\nAnd at the time, Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people in the trial were likely to have encounters with non-mask wearers.For more, see \"Danish Study Doesn’t Prove Masks Don’t Work Against the Coronavirus,\" Nov. 25, 2020Fauci followed science, CDC recommendations on masking Claim: \"Fauci lied\" about face masks when he wrote in a Feb. 5, 2020, email that \" are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection.\"Facts: Fauci’s public statements early in the pandemic on masking have been repeatedly distorted.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. A Danish study, DANMASK-19, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine on November 18, 2020. The study found that face masks provide limited protection to the wearer against COVID-19 infection. The study involved 6,024 adults who were divided into two groups, one wearing face masks and one control group. After one month, 1.8% of the people wearing masks had been infected, while 2.1% of the people in the control group had tested positive. The study's findings were inconclusive and did not prove that masks offer no protection from COVID-19.\n2. The DANMASK-19 trial was an investigator-initiated, nationwide, unblinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in Denmark in April and May 2020. The trial assessed whether a recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others reduced wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where public health measures were in effect but community mask wearing was uncommon and not recommended.\n3. The findings from the DANMASK-19 trial suggest that masks provide the wearer with limited protection. However, these findings do not suggest masks are useless in curbing the coronavirus' spread. Experts have urged the public to wear masks to prevent the wearer from unknowingly spreading the virus to other people.\n4. Social media posts have inaccurately described the results of the DANMASK-19 trial as \"conclusive\" and that masks \"don't work.\" However, the authors of the study specifically wrote that their findings were \"inconclusive.\"\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a Danish study proves masks offer no protection from COVID is false. The DANMASK-19 trial found that masks provide limited protection to the wearer against COVID-19 infection, not that masks offer no protection at all. The study's findings were inconclusive and did not prove that masks are useless in curbing the coronavirus' spread. Social media posts have inaccurately described the results of the study, leading to misunderstandings about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

While there is a risk of increased childhood obesity due to sedentary behavior during stay-at-home orders, it is also possible that kids could be getting more physical activity at home. The key takeaway is that parents should make a concerted effort to maintain healthy eating habits and promote physical activity during the pandemic. The study mentioned in the information provides evidence that school closures could contribute to a rise in childhood obesity, but it does not necessarily follow that all kids will become obese as a result of stay-at-home orders. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is important to consider the full range of factors at play.", "response": "TRUE."}

The NWSS is a system that tracks SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in communities across the United States. Wastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who are sick go to their doctor or hospital. It can also detect infections without symptoms. The NWSS provides national, regional, and state trends for COVID-19 in wastewater, as well as an early warning for authorities of new outbreaks and inform local decision-making. Wastewater surveillance can show if virus levels are increasing or decreasing in a community, and can provide an early warning that COVID-19 variants of concern may be spreading.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the CDC will survey wastewater for COVID-19 spread was published on August 20, 2020. The information provided from the CDC's NWSS website shows that the CDC has been working on wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 since at least March 2023. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the CDC was planning to survey wastewater for COVID-19 spread as early as August 2020, as the information provided supports the claim.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the claim does not specify that the CDC will use wastewater surveillance specifically to survey for COVID-19 spread. The claim is true in that the CDC has been surveying wastewater for COVID-19 spread, but it may not be entirely accurate in its wording.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided and knowledge of the CDC's NWSS, the claim is mostly true, but the wording could be more specific.", "response": "TRUE."}

Some posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ).\nBy mid-March, factory production data continued to underscore the impact of the pandemic on the country, as Chinese stocks fell again to six-week lows, ( here ). The claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the virus is therefore untrue. As it begins to ease its strict coronavirus curbs, China has urged authorities to pay more attention to asymptomatic cases, as part of efforts to allay public fears that large numbers of infectious people have gone unreported. Residents and medical staff in Wuhan told Reuters that testing problems at some hospitals meant that some infected people were not identified, and thus were not included in official data.\nSome posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ). Some posts go on to include further claims alluding to a possible conspiracy by the Chinese government and Democratic party members in the U.S. to financially cripple America and negatively frame President Donald Trump’s administration. In early February, when cities like Wuhan were in lockdown, fears about the spreading of the coronavirus wiped $393 billion off China’s stock market, despite government support moves, Reuters reported ( here ). A nearly 8% plunge on the Shanghai composite index was its biggest daily fall in more than four years.\nDespite criticisms related to the Chinese government’s lack of transparency, official coronavirus data released by Chinese health officials and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) do disprove the claims made on social media that only Wuhan was affected.

They were negative. She also said that no antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus had been found. The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.

But Hassad adds he believes that this lab-leak theory is on the “extreme low end” of possibilities, and it “will quite likely remain only theoretical following any proper scientific investigation,” he says.\nNewly reported information has revived scrutiny of this possible origin for the coronavirus, which experts still call unlikely though worth investigating. ...

When combined with subunit and specific inactivated antigens (30, 31), adjuvants with various characteristics elicit distinctive immunological profiles with regard to the direction, duration, and strength of immune responses. Thus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32).\nThus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32). Among these adjuvants, alum have been formulated with S protein or RBD to induce neutralizing antibody production (17, 18), which has suggested to be associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 (15, 16, 24).\nOther adjuvants, e.g., emulsion adjuvants and TLR agonists, which have been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses could be more favorable. However, no phase III clinical trial results of COVID-19 vaccines are published so far, thus, there is no direct evidence to indicate which type of immune response induced by vaccine plays a more critical protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How a new vaccine adjuvant might help to shorten race to COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nDifferent adjuvants also trigger different sensing pathways in our immune system.

Does that not solve the problem for vaccines against the novel coronavirus?\nBecause if you have an existing vaccine that already has an adjuvant that may be active, but perhaps weak, if you combine it with a bisphosphonate, you would expect to see synergistic activity. In fact, we tried bisphosphonate in combination with readily available vaccines, and we saw, indeed, that there was an amplification of the antibody immune response to those vaccines. What we are now trying to explore in animal models is, could we basically use bisphosphonate to turbocharge whatever COVID-19 vaccines may come online, hopefully within a year or so.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adjuvants for COVID-19 Vaccines - PMC\nContent:\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination focused on mRNA-type and viral vector vaccines. However, during the years 2022 and 2023, the first protein-based vaccines began to be approved. Adjuvanted vaccines are capable of inducing potent responses, not only humoral but also cellular, in populations whose immune systems are weak or do not respond properly, such as the elderly.\nAdjuvanted vaccines are capable of inducing potent responses, not only humoral but also cellular, in populations whose immune systems are weak or do not respond properly, such as the elderly. Therefore, this type of vaccine should complete the portfolio of existing vaccines, and could help to complete vaccination against COVID-19 worldwide now and over the coming years.\nTherefore, this type of vaccine should complete the portfolio of existing vaccines, and could help to complete vaccination against COVID-19 worldwide now and over the coming years. In this review we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of adjuvants, as well as their use in current and future vaccines against COVID-19. Keywords: vaccines, adjuvants, COVID-19, immune response\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 contains details about the use of adjuvants in vaccines, including the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine that uses a MatrixMTM adjuvant made from saponins derived from the soapbark tree. Aluminum-containing adjuvants are also mentioned, which have been used in vaccines since the 1930s to strengthen the immune response. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the use of the Novavax vaccine in people 18 years and older as a primary 2-dose series for the prevention of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 provides an overview of vaccine adjuvants, their importance, and potential side effects. It highlights the role of adjuvants in the production of increasingly effective vaccines and mentions the licensed RNA vaccines against COVID-19 that have intrinsic adjuvant properties.\n\nInformation 3 focuses on adjuvants for coronavirus vaccines and their role in inducing specific immune responses. Aluminum salts, emulsions, and toll-like receptor agonists are mentioned as adjuvants used in previous exploratory and pre-clinical CoV vaccine studies. There are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have been developed.\n\nInformation 4 discusses how different adjuvants trigger different sensing pathways in our immune system and the importance of combining vaccine antigens with a sufficient danger signal. The article also mentions the use of bisphosphonate to amplify the antibody immune response to readily available vaccines.\n\nInformation 5 highlights the benefits of adjuvanted vaccines, which can induce potent humoral and cellular responses in populations with weak or improperly responding immune systems, such as the elderly. The first protein-based vaccines against COVID-19 were approved during 2022 and 2023, and adjuvanted vaccines could help complete vaccination against COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim states that \"Adjuvants in COVID-19 vaccines can kill.\" However, none of the provided information supports this claim. In fact, the information provided highlights the safety and importance of adjuvants in vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Adjuvants have been used in vaccines for over 70 years, and there is no evidence to suggest that they can cause harm or \"kill\" individuals. Therefore, the claim is false based on the available information and general knowledge about vaccines and adjuvants.", "response": "FALSE."}

Owens' post used the example of people with heart disease. However, individuals with underlying medical conditions are in the higher-risk groups for the coronavirus, as Aiken detailed: As most people are aware, people pre-existing disease like heart failure, and COPD, seem to be at higher risk for death due to COVID-19.\nIf those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory. This helps all of us, as we learn what the natural disease risk factors for COVID-19 death are.\nThis helps all of us, as we learn what the natural disease risk factors for COVID-19 death are.

Do these two examples, however, prove the claim that the marking of COVID-19 deaths is pervasive and over-inflated?\nDo these two examples, however, prove the claim that the marking of COVID-19 deaths is pervasive and over-inflated? The answer is very likely no. Dr. Cara Christ, the head of the Arizona Department of Health Services told ABC 15 that the attending physician that witnesses a death is responsible for determining the cause of death.\nNot only do most doctors not have a financial incentive to determine causes of death, but there are multiple steps in the medical billing and coding process that are designed to prevent “upcoding” from happening. Dr. Murtaza Akhter is a professor at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, and an Emergency Room physician, who has had to sign several death notes in his line of work. We asked him if upcoding deaths for COVID-19 could occur in Arizona.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Debunking the False Claim That COVID Death Counts Are Inflated ...\nContent:\nNow some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020. This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is “a gross misinterpretation” of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nThat specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says.\nThe 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation most likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.\nEven someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus. The idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false, Anderson says.\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, discusses the importance of tracking all-cause mortality to provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted. It also explains that deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were estimated and comparing these two sets of estimates can provide insight about how many excess deaths are identified as due to COVID-19, and how many excess deaths are reported as due to other causes of death.\n\nInformation 2, published on September 17, 2020, states that overall about one in thirteen deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death, but this proportion has risen substantially to nearly a third over the last eight weeks. It also explains that COVID-19 should be recorded on the medical certificate of cause of death for all decedents where the disease caused or contributed to death, and that if COVID-19 is present on the death certificate as a significant condition contributing to death but not the underlying cause, these deaths \"are not deaths due to COVID-19 and should not be certified as such.\"\n\nInformation 3, published on April 1, 2020, emphasizes that COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death. It also explains that individuals with underlying medical conditions are in the higher-risk groups for the coronavirus, and if those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, states that there is evidence that there may be some deaths certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly, but it also states that the idea that the marking of COVID-19 deaths is pervasive and over-inflated is very likely not true. It also explains that the attending physician that witnesses a death is responsible for determining the cause of death, and that there are multiple steps in the medical billing and coding process that are designed to prevent \"upcoding\" from happening.\n\nInformation 5, published without a specific date, states that researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020, and that the inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is a gross misinterpretation of how death certificates work. It also explains that the idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false.\n\nThe claim in question, published on March 29, 2020, states that COVID-19 is not being blamed for deaths due to unrelated causes. Based on the information provided, it is clear that COVID-19 is being listed as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death on death certificates when the disease caused or contributed to death. However, it is also clear that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly. Overall, it is important to note that the attending physician is responsible for determining the cause of death and that there are multiple steps in the medical billing and coding process that are designed to prevent \"upcoding\" from happening.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it is clear that COVID-19 is being listed as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death on death certificates when the disease caused or contributed to death. However, it is also clear that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly. Therefore, the claim that COVID-19 is not being blamed for deaths due to unrelated causes is partially true, but it is important to note that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly.", "response": "FALSE."}

The approach of Leffler et al. (29) was replicated by Goldman Sachs for both US and international regions, finding that face masks have a large reduction effect on infections and fatalities, and estimating a potential impact on US GDP of 1 trillion dollars if a nationwide mask mandate were implemented (32). Although between-region comparisons do not allow for direct causal attribution, they suggest mask wearing to be a low-risk measure with a potentially large positive impact.\nHowever, masks were far less effective at blocking rhinovirus particles of any size, or of blocking small influenza particles. The results suggest that masks may have a significant role in source control for the current coronavirus outbreak. The study did not use COVID-19 patients, and it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves the same as these seasonal coronaviruses, which are of the same family. In a pair of studies from 1962 to 1975, a portable isolation box was attached to an Andersen Sampler and used to measure orally expelled bacterial contaminants before and after masking.\nIn a study of the effect of mask use on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, masks were found to be highly effective, including for children, and the secondary attack rate for children was found to be only half that of adults. However, the impact of masks on children was not compared to adults (10). Some researchers have proposed that face shields may be appropriate in some environments (132), but it has not been well studied.\nHomemade masks worn by sick people can also reduce transmission through droplets.” One preprint systematic review (19) including epidemiological, theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence found that “face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.” On the other hand, a preprint systematic review that only included RCTs and observational studies (20) concluded, based on the RCTs, that there was only weak evidence for a small effect from mask use in the community, but that the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...\nContent:\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020. Fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., issued mandates for face mask use in public between April 8 and May 15. We identified the effects of state mandates for the use of face masks in public on the daily COVID-19 growth rate, using an event study that examined the effects over different periods.\nThe orders also clearly specify that the face masks are not a replacement for any other social distancing protocols. More information on dates and links to these state orders are in appendix exhibit A1 and appendices D and E.19 Fifteen states had not yet issued community or employee mandates when we performed the study. The main model used publicly available daily county-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from March 25 through May 21.20 The data covered all states plus Washington, D.C., and the analytical sample included 2,930 unique counties plus New York City (five boroughs combined).\nSOURCE Authors’ analysis of US county-level COVID-19 case data between March 31 and May 22, 2020.

Kapenga claimed that Wisconsin had a test of mask effectiveness in May when the state went from masks to no masks, and there was no significant difference in cases. However, PolitiFact rates this claim as false, stating that what was lifted in May was Evers’ stay-at-home order, not the mask requirement.\n\nInformation 2: This information is a study reviewing the evidence on face masks' effectiveness against COVID-19. The study found that masks may have a significant role in source control for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.

On the most basic level, insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness and feelings of fatigue. Sleep disturbances cause reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impair our ability to maintain focus. [These effects can be a matter of life or death when it comes to patient care.] There is an often-cited study where participants were tested on a hand-eye coordination performance task under conditions of sleep deprivation and while consuming progressive amounts of alcohol.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Lack of sleep is harming health care workers – and their patients\nContent:\nMany people often assume that health care providers are healthier than the general population. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has shined a concerning light on the the physical and mental health of health care workers – and their lack of sleep.\nI am an expert in sleep and stress among middle-aged adults in the workplace, and my research has found that work-related stress influences sleep quantity and quality. And not only that – poor sleep may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for both health care workers and their patients.\nHealth care workers face many stressors, and many studies have shown that sleep plays a major role. For example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\nFor example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media.\nA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Sleep disorders, particularly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), affect a significant number of healthcare workers (HCWs). These sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, daytime drowsiness, and sleep deprivation, which can impair work productivity, lead to occupational accidents and errors, and negatively impact patient care. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA, and 40.9% of HCWs reported at least one type of sleep disorder.\n2. A study published in 2021 found that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression, 50% more likely to report psychological distress, and 70% more likely to report anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened sleep patterns and mental health issues among HCWs due to increased stress and workload.\n3. Insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impairments in maintaining focus. These effects can have severe consequences in patient care.\n4. Health care workers face significant work-related stress, which can negatively impact sleep quantity and quality. A 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\n5. A study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that nearly all frontline HCWs reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim \"Sleep Troubles Hit Health Care Workers\" is TRUE.

Given the proper guidance and sources of information, most such people should be able to manage the anxiety, worry, and dysphoria associated with this critical pandemic.\nThen there are those who have preexisting mental conditions related to mood, anxiety, stress, or obsessive tendencies. They are probably going to have an increase in their symptoms, and as such, a corresponding need for adjusting treatment. This may require an increase in their existing medications or the addition of an ad hoc medication, or perhaps more frequent contact with their doctor or therapist.\nSubstance abuse is also a condition vulnerable to the stress effects of this pandemic. This will prompt or tempt those to use substances that they've abused or turned to in the past as a way of self-medicating and assuaging their anxiety and worry.\nFor the worried well and for the clinicians who have understandable fears about exposure, there are several things you can try to manage your anxiety. There are concentric circles of concern that you have to maintain. Think of it like the instructions on an airplane when, if there's a drop in cabin pressure, you're asked to apply your own oxygen mask first before placing one on your child.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Advice for Lessening Your Pandemic Anxiety\nContent:\nAnd we'll get through it too.

It's good to know that before this pandemic ends, some of these treatments will probably be clinically applied, mostly to those who are severely affected and in intensive care.\nWe should be proud of that, as it shows how Americans and people around the world stand up in situations like this. Let's also note that even though everybody is affected and undergoing previously unimaginable levels of anticipated stress and dislocation, it's the healthcare providers who are really on the frontlines. They're under tremendous pressure to continue to perform heroically, at great risk to themselves. They deserve a real debt of gratitude.

The Omicron variant, which is now the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, is highly contagious and spreads faster than the original virus. The CDC reports there is evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted if you get within 6 feet of someone who is infectious for a total of 15 minutes throughout a day. We can work to lower the transmission rate by wearing high-quality face masks when we can't stay 6 feet away from others, washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other people, and getting vaccinated.\nDo this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread.

FULL CLAIM: this coronavirus genome contained sequences of another virus […] the HIV virus (AIDS virus) Numerous articles published in April 2020 report that Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier claimed that “SARS-CoV-2 is a manipulated virus that was accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China” and that “Indian researchers have already tried to publish the results of the analyses that showed that this coronavirus genome contained sequences of another virus […] the HIV virus (AIDS virus).” The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains “HIV insertions” began circulating in January 2020, and was propagated by outlets such as Zero Hedge and Infowars.\nIn summary, genomic analysis of the virus indicates that it does not contain so-called “HIV insertions” and that it was not engineered in a lab.

Another Nobel laureate, Tasuku Honjo, was also rumored to have said that COVID-19 was \"man-made.\" While the scientific community disputed the accuracy of Montagnier's comments, Honjo's alleged comment was dismissed because he simply didn't say it.

Bring your infection with you.” And then she said, “He should have done it earlier” — about me.\nIn May, Trump shifted to references to Pelosi “dancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown.” She didn’t. Pelosi did walk the streets of Chinatown Feb. 24 and urged people to return to its shops and restaurants.\nPresident Donald Trump has upped the ante in his allegations about Nancy Pelosi and Chinatown, falsely charging that the House speaker urged foreign nationals to “bring your infection” to the San Francisco neighborhood. Pelosi never issued such an invitation.\nTrump variously said Pelosi held a “rally” in Chinatown, was having or wanted to have “parties” or a “street party” there and encouraged people to go to a “big parade.” In fact, Pelosi never mentioned parties or rallies, and the “big parade” — the Chinese New Year Parade — took place on Feb. 8, two weeks before Pelosi went there.

Senior U.S. government officials have already started to receive the vaccine, with Vice President Mike Pence, his wife, Karen, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams getting the shot live on national television Friday morning.\nThe vaccine likely won't be available to the general public for months as Pfizer ramps up production of the vaccine.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-19, contains a post with photos of Nancy Pelosi getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-12-20, is a fact-check article debunking claims that Nancy Pelosi did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine because the syringe had an orange cap on it. The article states that photos clearly show the needle going into her arm without a cap. The article also mentions that Pelosi received the first dose of the vaccine on Dec 17.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-12-26, is an article by The Associated Press debunking the claim that Pelosi did not receive the vaccine. The article explains that the orange piece is more likely the needle hub, and Pelosi acknowledged receiving the vaccine.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-12-23, is an article discussing the claim that Pelosi staged the photo of herself getting the vaccine. The article explains that Pelosi received the vaccine on Dec 18 and that the orange cap is part of the needle hub.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-12-19, is an article about Pelosi and McConnell receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The article states that Pelosi received the vaccine on Dec 18.\n\nClaim: Nancy Pelosi faked taking a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is FALSE. All the information published before the claim contradicts it, stating that Nancy Pelosi received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Dec 17 or Dec 18, 2020. The claim was published on Dec 25, 2020, and there is no evidence to support the claim that Pelosi faked taking the vaccine. Instead, there is consistent evidence that she received the vaccine several days before the claim was published.", "response": "FALSE."}

As of June 1, 2022, all anti-covid measures have been abolished in Italy, including the obligation of a green pass to enter or leave the country, as for many other EU countries except for health facilities.\nBetween 2020 and 2022 hundreds of people from all over Italy protested against COVID-19 regulations. The protests ended with the abolishment of the majority of restrictions in June 2022. After the 2022 Italian general election in September, the remaining restrictions were removed completely by the Meloni Cabinet after Giorgia Meloni began serving as Prime Minister in October 2022.\nOn 23 October, hundreds of people protested in Naples in the coastal section of Mergellina, after stricter COVID-19 measures were imposed in the city and the whole region of Campania. The protesters clashed with police, wounding seven officers with smoke bombs, burning trash bins and chanting against the President of the region, Vincenzo De Luca. Some people threw projectiles at police and two people were arrested. Violent protests spread in the following days in several Italian cities, with protesters clashing with the police, smashing windows and looting shops; several enquires pointed out that these protests had been infiltrated by far-right and far-left movements (like Forza Nuova and the social centres), skinhead groups and football hooligans.\nAmong them, some also wore orange vests, and many citizens from different areas of Italy with the slogans \"Traitors. Give us back our freedom\" and \"The coronavirus is all a political, economic and social design because they want to sell us to China\". About two hundred were present, with 70 those identified by the Rome Police Headquarters at the end of the day.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-12-18\nTitle: Protests against responses to the COVID-19 pandemic - Wikipedia\nContent:\nOn 31 July 2021, hundreds of protesters attempted to gather in Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur, calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin over his and the Malaysian government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The protests took place despite Movement Control Order (MCO) restrictions being in place, and Malaysian police blocking access to Merdeka Square itself. The anti-government protests took place following a state of emergency declaration, where parliament and elections were suspended, and amid an ongoing political crisis.\nIn May 2020, a lowered approval of authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko amid his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic led to street protests against his government. Mass protests erupted across Belarus following the August 2020 Belarusian presidential election which was marred by allegations of widespread electoral fraud. On 6 April 2021, anti-governmental protests \"Fight for Life\" were held by a group of citizens and activists in Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital Sarajevo in front of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Federal Government, seeking resignations from Chairman of the Council of Ministers Zoran Tegeltija and Federal Prime Minister Fadil Novalić, due to lack of leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina and late procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for the country.\nA non-violent anti-lockdown protest with approximately 450 people in attendance took place on 6 March in Cork. The event was organised by The People's Convention. Six people were arrested on the day of the protest.

The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.) Some media-watchers argued that Trump was deliberately distracting attention from weightier matters—including the firing of the State Department inspector general—and that the media shouldn’t let him.

The reporters seemed stunned. “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” Trump told them. The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.

The case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2013 that simply isolating a natural product is not enough to warrant a patent. But just because some research centres and companies filed to patent animal coronaviruses and the human SARS virus means absolutely nothing with regards to the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nWe have seen Mike Adams, the Plandemic conspiracy film, and a recent French video viewed by nearly 1.5 million people claim that a trail of patent applications prove that scientists created the COVID-19 coronavirus in a laboratory. They also apparently decided to protect their intellectual property along the way.\nThere are two lessons I want to draw from this on-going patent fear-mongering. The first is that “coronavirus” is not a word that only applies to the agent behind COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a subfamily in the grand classification of viruses. They include our current enemy, SARS-CoV-2, but also a different coronavirus that caused SARS nearly twenty years ago, and the coronavirus that produces the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nA French conspiracy video making the rounds points to a coronavirus patent held by the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Université Paris VII (EP 1 694 829 B1). The video even goes so far as to accuse France of creating the COVID-19 coronavirus and releasing it in Wuhan.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: US20200279585A1 - System and Method for Testing for COVID-19 - ...\nContent:\nA method is provided for acquiring and transmitting biometric data (e.g., vital signs) of a user, where the data is analyzed to determine whether the user is suffering from a viral infection, such as COVID-19.

The site shows that the filing is a \"continuation in part\" (CIP) application for a US patent, i.e. a partial continuation of an existing application.\nThe CIP application was later submitted in May 2020 because the method can be used to “determine whether the user is suffering from a viral infection, such as COVID-19,” as noted in the patent's abstract.  · Rainer Osterwalder, a European Patent Office spokesperson, also said the “the patent application had no reference to COVID-19 before 2020.\"\nBiotech Cancer Coronavirus/COVID-19 Clinical Trials Diabetes Genetics Infectious Disease Neuro Obesity Women?s Health View all Medicine Channels arrow_right_alt Sciencekeyboard_arrow_right\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-27, is a fact-checking article that debunks the claim about Richard Rothschild patenting a COVID-19 test in 2015 and 2017. The article mentions a patent for a \"System and Method for Testing for COVID-19\" (EP 1 694 829 B1) that was found on a Dutch website, but it does not mention COVID-19 and was filed in 2017 as a predecessor to 'US20200279585A1'.

However, differences in underlying health conditions among Black and Asian people, obtained from primary care records, were able to explain only a quarter of the excess deaths from COVID-19.[2]\nCOVID-19 patients who are admitted to critical care or who die in hospital include a disproportionately large number of people from ethnic minorities.[1][2] In the UK, one in three patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 has been from an ethnic minority group, although they make up only one in eight of the UK population.[3] The excess risk of severe COVID-19 to people from ethnic minorities is visible not only in hospital admissions, but also in the community. In a national cohort of 6 million veterans in the USA, Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested and to test positive for COVID-19 than Whites.[4] In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysed all deaths in England and Wales with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nPeople in ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with higher exposure to coronavirus infection, which could result in more cases of COVID-19.[1] On the other hand, ethnic minority populations tend to be younger on average than the UK population, and younger people are less susceptible to severe illness following infection. The total numbers of deaths recorded in hospitals are similar per capita for Black African and White ethnic groups.\nThe difference was particularly large for Black men and women, who were more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 than White men and women.[5] Can these differences be explained in terms of exposure to coronavirus infection, or susceptibility to severe illness and death following infection, or both?\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds are more likely to die ...\nContent:\nAfter adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian backgrounds were 1.49 times more likely to die compared to those from white backgrounds, and patients from black backgrounds were 1.30 times more likely to die.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

They're common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats. Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.\nThe older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness. You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions: ...

Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels. If you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19.\nIf you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19. That said, having schizophrenia is the biggest risk factor for besides age for COVID mortality. Those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are prone to metabolic syndrome, which includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and is associated with systemic inflammation. All of which is exacerbated by COVID. Mood and anxiety disorders were not connected to the higher risk, but people living with mental health conditions may have certain symptoms that can interfere with their ability to care for themselves and be engaged in their health decisions.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-06-07\nTitle: Can COVID Cause You to Develop Asthma?\nContent:\nResearch suggests that asthma isn’t a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 infection. But some research also suggests that people with asthma may be at increased risk of long COVID and may experience worse asthma symptoms.\nThere’s currently no way to predict whether you’ll develop asthma and no way to prevent it. Still, people at greater risk of the disease may wish to avoid manageable risk factors like smoking and exposure to pollutants. Also, you can stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations to reduce your risk of infection and long COVID conditions.\nOne small 2022 study involving children hospitalized for COVID-19 found that about · 41.5% of them developed asthma-like symptoms. But that study also found that the risk of developing asthma was higher in children with a family history. This may be due to the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the airways in your lungs.\nBut some research also suggests that people with asthma may be at increased risk of long COVID and may experience worse asthma symptoms. A 2022 study found that people with asthma were at a higher risk of specific symptoms for up to 180 days, including: ... 2022 study found that, even with mild to moderate COVID symptoms, some people with asthma developed worse symptoms in the long term.

Expression of ACE2, the co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, varies with age [81]. Because Type-2 asthma sufferers tend to be younger than those with other comorbidities, the age factor probably explains why patients with asthma may not be at greater risk.\nHere we aim to review the latest evidence on the links between asthma and COVID-19 and provide reasoned answers to current concerns, such as the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severe COVID-19 stratified by asthmatic patients, the contribution of type-2 vs. non-type-2 asthma and asthma-COPD overlap to the risk of COVID-19 development. We also address the potential role of both standard anti-inflammatory asthma therapies and new biological agents for severe asthma, such as mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes.\nThis wide aspect could be further dissected in several questions that need to be addressed: 1) are asthmatics at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severe COVID-19? 2) could different asthma endotypes (type 2 asthma vs. non-type 2 asthma) carry a different risk profile in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 development, and progression to severe disease outcomes?\nIn conclusion, there is great variability in the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in different countries; in most countries patients with asthma were not reported with higher, but rather similar or lower rates of COVID-19 infection, compared with the general population in the corresponding area, probably due to multiple factors including a low proportion of non-type 2 phenotypes [38]. Indeed, a Korean nationwide cohort showed that patients with non-allergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity than patients with allergic asthma [46].

A person with a condition that is not listed may still be at greater risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 than other people who do not have the condition.\nIt is important that you talk with your healthcare provider about your risk. Having cancer can make you more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Treatments for many types of cancer can weaken your body’s ability to fight off disease. At this time, based on available studies, having a history of cancer may increase your risk.\nIf you or your family member are at high risk for severe illness, wear a mask or respirator with greater protection in public indoor spaces if you are in an area with a high COVID-19 hospital admission level. Talk with your healthcare provider about wearing a mask in a medium COVID-19 hospital admission level. If you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and you are aged 50 years or older OR are at high risk of getting very sick, you may be eligible for treatment.\nIf you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and you are aged 50 years or older OR are at high risk of getting very sick, you may be eligible for treatment.

What international law says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and “are particularly protective of civilian hospitals”, according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.\nArticle 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including “intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected”.\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are “military objectives”. Philip-Gay said that “if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used”, the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.\nOne: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque – those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-02\nTitle: What are the laws of war when a hospital is a war zone? | The Hill\nContent:\nAll wars are an effrontery to health, and the Israel-Hamas war is no exception. Caring for the wounded is a necessary part of waging war and hospitals are protected from the consequence of hostilities. Additionally, all medical personnel are considered non-combatants.\nAccording to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals can never be a military target. That hospitals should not be a military target seems uncontroversial, but a deeper question remains: when is a building a hospital and when is it not?\nHumanitarian law is pragmatic, however, and has an answer when attacks are launched from places assumed to be protected. A building ceases to be a hospital when it is used as a base to launch rockets. Under these circumstances, a building is transformed from “hospital” to “legitimate military target.” The distinctive emblem designating non-combatant status is the red cross, the reverse colors of the Swiss flag; launching only one rocket from the hospital parking lot is enough to change the meaning of a red cross on that building from “hospital” to “bullseye.”\nIf a decision is made to attack a hospital, international humanitarian law requires advanced warning to that hospital. If the hospital fails to heed the warning, the subsequent attack on that hospital must adhere to the principles of precaution and proportionality.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: Can Hospitals Be Military Targets? What International Law Says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva Conventions, adopted in the aftermath of World War II, form the core of international humanitarian law and \"are particularly protective of civilian hospitals\", according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon-3 university in southeast France. \"It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone.\nArticle 8 of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including \"intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected\".\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are \"military objectives\". Philip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target.\nPhilip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. But \"the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians\", she said. Even if the hospital is used for \"acts harmful to the enemy\", Philip-Gay said, the other party \"does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it\", citing the need under international law for the response to be \"proportionate\".\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: The protection of hospitals during armed conflicts: What the law ...\nContent:\nAccording to international humanitarian law (IHL), health establishments and units, including hospitals, should not be attacked. This protection extends to the wounded and sick as well as to medical staff and means of transport. The rule has few exceptions.\nThe protection provided to the wounded and sick would have little meaning if medical personnel, medical units and establishments (such as hospitals), and medical means of transport were subject to attack. Therefore, IHL extends specific protections to them; parties to a conflict must respect them while they are performing an exclusively medical function, and must not unduly interfere with their work so as to allow them to treat the wounded and sick.\nSpecific protection of medical establishments and units (including hospitals) is the general rule under IHL. Therefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\".\nTherefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\". In case of doubt as to whether medical units of establishments are used to commit an \"act harmful to the enemy\", they should be presumed not to be so used.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (no publication date): Customary IHL states that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law unless they lose their protective status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. If there is doubt about a hospital's status, it should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 2 (published 2023-11-17): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, if there is doubt, the hospital should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 3 (published 2023-11-02): Hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be a military target. However, if a hospital is used to launch rockets, it becomes a legitimate military target. Advanced warning must be given before attacking a hospital, and the attack must follow the principles of precaution and proportionality.\n\nInformation 4 (published 2023-11-16): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians, and the response must be proportionate.\n\nInformation 5 (published 2023-11-16): According to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals should not be attacked, and medical personnel, medical units, and means of transport should be respected. The protection of hospitals can only cease if they are used for harmful acts against the enemy, and in case of doubt, hospitals should be presumed not to be used for such acts.\n\nClaim Summary: An official decree was taken by the government stating that the military will have to help in hospitals.\n\nGiven the information available, the claim does not provide enough context to determine if it is true or false. However, the information provided does support the idea that hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be attacked unless they lose their protected status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. Therefore, if the government decree states that the military will be helping in hospitals, it is likely that the hospitals have not lost their protected status and are still considered protected civilian facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

The app was intended to augment traditional contact tracing by automatically tracking encounters between users and later allowing a state or territory health authority to warn a user they have come within 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) with an infected person for 15 minutes or more.\nAdding to the confusion, many news reports used images of Coronavirus Australia in their articles, and the COVIDSafe website linked to the Coronavirus Australia apps for a short time after release. The app launched on 26 April 2020. However, there were early reports that some users had problems with the sign-up. For example, those who entered their phone number during sign-up received the following message: \"Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again.\" Within 24 hours of COVIDSafe's release it had been downloaded by over a million people, and within 48 hours more than two million.\nThese claims are false, as COVIDSafe and ENF are completely incompatible, and ENF is disabled until a compatible app is installed and explicit user consent is given. Even if a third party were to obtain the encounter log of a user, no persons could be identified without also holding the logs of other users the client has encountered. Australia's Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security reported that several of Australia's intelligence and security agencies collected data from COVIDSafe in its first months of operation.\nCOVIDSafe requires an Australia mobile number to register, meaning foreigners in Australia need a local SIM card. Initially, residents of Norfolk Island, an external territory of Australia, were unable to register with the app as they used a different country code to mainland Australia, +672 instead of +61. The Australian government released an update resolving the issue on 18 June 2020.

There is some evidence that Ebola in 2014 impacted the election, but otherwise, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-18\nTitle: Viral Posts Falsely Align Viruses to Election Years - FactCheck.org\nContent:\nThe image, which appears in numerous Facebook posts, shows a handwritten sign that reads, in part, “Every election year has a disease.” It then lists: “SARS-2004 Avian-2008 Swine-2010 MERS-2012 Ebola-2014 Zika-2016 Ebola-2018 Corona-2020” · The list focuses on presidential election and midterm election years. It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year. We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread. The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004.\nViral posts on social media claim COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in \"every election year,\" suggesting that the new coronavirus is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump. But most of the dates cited to defend those conclusions about previous outbreaks are misleading or incorrect.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim that every election year has a disease is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations including Reuters, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org.\n* The claim lists various diseases such as SARS, avian flu, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus, and matches them to election years since 2004.\n* However, most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.\n* Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n* While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n* The claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of some of the diseases.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim that every election year has a disease is false, as shown by multiple fact-checking organizations. Most of the diseases listed were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of some of the diseases. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become a significant issue in the U.S. until 2006. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, before the 2010 midterm election year. MERS was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were reported in 2014 and 2015.\n\nWhile Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics. The claim that there is a trend of disease outbreaks matched to elections is false and misleading.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and evidence, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19.

Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well.\nThe most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon.

For example, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty had stronger associations with AMI in women compared with men, they found. The study was published May 3 in JAMA Network Open. While heart attacks are often associated with older adults, this population-based case-control study examined the relationships among a wide range of AMI-related risk factors involving younger adults.\nThe study found that seven risk factors, many potentially modifiable, collectively accounted for a majority of the total risk of AMI in young women (83.9%) and young men (85.1%). Some of these factors — including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty — have a larger impact on young woman than they do among young men, Lu and her colleagues found. “This study speaks to the importance of specifically studying young women suffering heart attacks, a group that has largely been neglected in many studies and yet is about as large as the number of young women diagnosed with breast cancer,” said Harlan M.\nRaising awareness about the incidence of heart attacks in younger women is a key part of the strategy, she said. The next frontier of cardiovascular disease prevention in young women could be better understanding the role of women-related factors.

With this editorial, we plan to discuss the current understanding of the impact on physician suicide in the context of COVID-19.\nThe increased stressors due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the family unit have led to increasing mental health concerns across the lifespan from parents to their children [7,8]. In addition to the detrimental effect on the general public’s mental health, it has been shown that frontline healthcare workers experienced significant distress during COVID-19 [9]. Noteworthy factors in the development of distress in healthcare workers included feelings of loss of control and vulnerability and difficulty adapting to change [10]. Due to the increased rates of burnout among healthcare workers, vicarious trauma, and increased stress from social isolation, an increase in physician suicides rates is expected. With this editorial, we plan to discuss the current understanding of the impact on physician suicide in the context of COVID-19.\nMore resources should be channeled to help physicians recover from vicarious trauma that they experience to prevent physician suicide. ...

Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.\nNICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.

NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.\nThe fascination with vitamin D supplementation began with the discovery in the early 1920s that vitamin D prevented rickets and was further driven by the recognition of other potential roles of vitamin D in non-skeletal outcomes, including immune function, cardiovascular health, and cancer. However, whereas data on the function of vitamin D in bone growth and maintenance is clear-cut and has informed practical clinical guidelines and public health policies over the years, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in other health and disease processes, in particular in acute respiratory tract infection, remains patchy.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D may not protect against COVID-19, as previously ...\nContent:\nBut there is still not enough evidence that taking supplements can prevent or treat COVID-19 in the general population. “Most vitamin D studies are very difficult to interpret since they cannot adjust for the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as older age or having chronic diseases, which are also predictors of low vitamin D,” says co-author Guillaume Butler-Laporte, a physician and a fellow under the supervision of Professor Brent Richards at McGill University.\nWhile previous research early in the pandemic suggested that vitamin D cuts the risk of contracting COVID-19, a new study from McGill University finds there is no genetic evidence that the vitamin works as a protective measure against the coronavirus. \"Vitamin D supplementation as a public health measure to improve outcomes is not supported by this study. Most importantly, our results suggest that investment in other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be prioritized for COVID-19 randomized clinical trials,\" say the authors.\nFuture studies are needed to explore the relationship with vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes in other populations, say the researchers. “In the past Mendelian randomization has consistently predicted results of large, expensive, and timely vitamin D trials.

It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data.\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.\nAs some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.

Moreover, most of the people who use cannabis also report tobacco use concurrently. This fact may increase the risk of exposure to toxic substances, as certain co-users (for example, blunt users) tend to have higher levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled air and cannabis smoke may have higher levels of some carcinogens than tobacco smoke [7]. Previous studies have indicated that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease [8], metabolic syndromes and changes in the immune system [9].

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can.

Experts say the study is promising, but more research needs to be done. Experts point out that aspirin is not a preventive medicine and can cause side effects such as excessive bleeding. A daily dose of aspirin may help reduce the risk of serious complications from COVID-19.\nThe researchers examined the records of 412 adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospitals across the United States between March and July.

But just as often, they lean toward the eccentric: from beans with magical powers to aspirin dissolved in hot honey.\nLast week, for example, Bolsonaro said he would order the Health Ministry to meet with one of his supporters who claimed raw garlic cures COVID-19.

Two new fair-quality case–control studies (2607 and 2045 cases) from France and Canada each found N95 respirators associated with decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2 versus surgical masks, although estimates were imprecise (adjusted OR, 0.85 [CI, 0.55 to 1.29] [18] and adjusted OR, 0.6 [CI, 0.3 to 1.1] during nonaerosol generating procedures and adjusted OR [CI, 0.2 to 2.0] during aerosol generating procedures, in postvaccination period [19]). On the basis of the new RCT, the strength of evidence was changed from insufficient to low for similar effects of N95 and surgical masks when providing routine patient care in health care settings (Figure 2 and Supplement Table 7).\nThe other study (n = 963) found FFP2 respirator use in Italian HCWs associated with a marked increased risk for PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it only adjusted for sex (adjusted OR, 7.1 [CI, 3.6 to 13.9]) (31). One new RCT (4) and 2 new observational studies (18, 19) compared N95 versus surgical masks in health care settings. The RCT (n = 1009) was done in Canada, Israel, Pakistan, and Egypt and compared instruction to use N95 versus surgical masks in HCWs providing routine patient care (4). Surgical masks were noninferior to N95s for risk for PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR, 1.14 [CI, 0.77 to 1.69]) on the basis of a prespecified noninferiority margin of up to a doubling of risk.\nThe original review, done near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, included only 2 observational studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection that provided insufficient evidence (2). Although evidence on other respiratory illnesses was more robust, applicability to SARS-CoV-2 was uncertain.\nThe purpose of this update is to incorporate this RCT and other new studies. This update focuses on SARS-CoV-2 infection, given increased evidence availability and uncertain applicability of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to a change in conclusions, this report met criteria for a major update (5). The key questions for the initial review were developed with input from staff at the American College of Physicians and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

It shows (what we already knew) that wearing a mask does not protect the person wearing the mask as much as we would like.

Unfortunately, anti-maskers are using this study as \"prof\" that they don't need to wear masks.\nUnfortunately, anti-maskers are using this study as \"prof\" that they don't need to wear masks. This is irresponsible and should be made clear in the title of the study. From the discussion: \"The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nBetween 6 April and 9 May 2020, we found a similar seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 of 1.9% (CI, 0.8% to 2.3%) in Danish blood donors using the Livzon point-of-care test and assessed by laboratory technicians (36). Testing at the end of follow-up, however, may not have captured any infections contracted during the last part of the study period, but this would have been true in both the mask and control groups and was not expected to influence the overall findings. The face masks provided to participants were high-quality surgical masks with a filtration rate of 98% (37).\nHowever, WHO acknowledges that we lack evidence that wearing a mask protects healthy persons from SARS-CoV-2 (prevention) (17). A systematic review of observational studies reported that mask use reduced risk for SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19 by 66% overall, 70% in health care workers, and 44% in the community (12).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-03-09\nTitle: Effectiveness of Mask Wearing to Control Community Spread of ...\nContent:\nThis JAMA Insights CDC review summarizes accumulating evidence <strong>that</strong> <strong>mask</strong> wearing reduces spread of <strong>SARS</strong>-<strong>CoV</strong>-<strong>2</strong> infection and that universal mandatory <strong>mask</strong> wearing policies reduce infections and deaths and emphasizes face <strong>masks</strong> are one component of pandemic control measures, including physical...\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-17, is a Science Feedback article debunking the claim that researchers were forced to withdraw a pro-mask study due to an increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in areas analyzed in the study.

Not even the protective masks can hide the smiles. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus has hospitalized more than 900 county residents and killed more than 165 in a worldwide war that seems months if not years away from ending.

Each discharge celebration is different, tailored to the patient. Some want music and an iPad recording. Others are more private. But the gauntlet of hospital staff doing the standing ovation is a constant. Now the celebration idea has spread to other Scripps hospitals, each adding its own twist.\nShe helped with the celebrations at UC San Diego’s hospitals in La Jolla and Hillcrest by arranging for a custom melody to be written and recorded. The health system already had what it calls “chimes” that sound on certain occasions — one for when a baby is born, another when someone donates an organ. After Meehan saw internet videos of nurses in Washington state celebrating COVID-19 recoveries with a special tune, she wanted to do that here, too.\nBack came a guitar melody that gets played now to mark COVID-19 recoveries and departures, sent via PA speakers throughout the medical centers, so people not directly involved in patient care can hear it, too. Meehan said the tune appears to be boosting staff morale, bringing some hope and triumph in a troubling time. “It’s not even 10 a.m.,” a colleague emailed her one day recently, “and I’ve already heard it three times!” ...

THE FACTS: As the COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out in several countries, false claims have swirled on social media alleging that the injections are staged.\nAlberta’s government also posted a video of Hinshaw receiving the shot on Oct. 19. The video clearly shows that the needle went into her arm. ...

How embarrassing,” the Facebook post falsely states.\n\nThe claim that footage of movie props and flu shot clips were used to falsely claim that world leaders' Covid-19 vaccines were 'staged' can be classified as TRUE based on the provided information.\n\nThe information provided includes a report from AFP Fact Check, dated 2021-01-19, which debunks the claim that world leaders' Covid-19 vaccines were staged using fake needles. The report states that the video used in the claim is a montage of real events, but they are depicted and labeled in misleading ways. One of the video segments shows a flu shot that was administered in 2019, and another shows a staged promotional event. Other parts of the video mischaracterize the type of medical equipment used or mistakes that occurred during vaccinations and were later corrected.\n\nAdditionally, the report states that the first video actually shows prop master Scott Reeder showing how a retractable syringe and other stage props work in a video he posted on September 2, 2020 on TikTok. The clip is then spliced with a clip of a man explaining how a retractable syringe works with shots of people receiving vaccinations. The text overlaid on the video in English and Malaysian reads: “Fake needle used to inject world leaders (global elite)”.\n\nThe information also states that the misleading video has been shared alongside a similar claim on various social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube.\n\nIn summary, the information provided supports the claim that footage of movie props and flu shot clips were used to falsely claim that world leaders' Covid-19 vaccines were 'staged'. The video is a montage of real events, but they are depicted and labeled in misleading ways to suggest that the vaccinations were staged using fake needles.", "response": "FALSE."}

So far, 32 bodies buried in 2020 have been claimed and removed from the graveyard.\nThe week beginning April 6, 138 people were buried there as a result of COVID-19 because morgues were overfilled; at one point, the rate of burials went from roughly 25 a week to around 25 a day. “This trench was supposed to last us the whole year,” Thompson says, looking over the mass grave.\nAt the height of the outbreak last spring, New York’s hospital morgues and mortuaries became overwhelmed, and the mass graves on Hart Island emerged as an expedient option for the city’s fast-rising number of dead. More coffins were stacked aboard the ferry dispatched to the dock here. More trenches were dug. Through the end of October, 2,009 New Yorkers have been buried on Hart Island in 2020, more than double last year’s total of 846. No one knows how many of the people arriving here died of COVID-19.\nAnd to people who oversee the graveyard, burial is a more sensible option than cremation. “What if someone is sent by mistake?” says Captain Martin Thompson, 59, of the city’s DOC, who has overseen operations on Hart Island for 15 years. “You can’t reverse a cremation.” · When Torron arrived, COVID-19 was triggering the biggest shift in operations on the island in a century and a half.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Hart Island: Coronavirus burials in New York remake history - The ...\nContent:\nViral drone video capturing the burial of covid-19 victims on Hart Island in early April 2020 brought the elusive mass grave into the national spotlight.

That’s the reason New York City has never run out of burial space,” Hunt said, adding that even after the 1918 flu epidemic, the city didn’t begin recycling until it ran out of space in 1931. Mass burials on Hart Island often hold a negative association, most likely because of the way burials have evolved throughout history, as private funerals have become the norm.\n“So now we have these people dead of coronavirus that may not have relatives, who don’t have the means to take care of this themselves,” said Laqueur, of Berkeley. “And we have to sort of struggle to create a place that represents they’re remaining part of the community, of the honored rather than the humiliated.” ...

Governor Andrew Cuomo said he took \"solace\" from this fact, as well as the continued decline in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to New York hospitals.\nImages have emerged of coffins being buried in a mass grave in New York City, as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to rise. Workers in hazmat outfits were seen stacking wooden coffins in deep trenches in Hart Island.

The fact-check confirms that the video showing the tanks on a train is real but states that it does not mean troops are moving into towns to impose martial law. The video was taken in Moorpark, California, near the Naval Base Ventura County.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-24, explains that the movement of military equipment, including tanks, by train is a part of normal military operations and is not related to the COVID-19 pandemic or any conspiracy theory. The presence of specific types of vehicles suggests it is part of a U.S. Army armored brigade combat team.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2024-01-07, is a Wikipedia entry for martial law in the United States, describing historical instances of martial law, including the suppression of town meetings and assemblies in Massachusetts during the Boston Tea Party and the imposition of martial law in New Orleans during the War of 1812.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, reports on thousands of American military deployments across towns and cities, with many wondering if martial law is about to be declared in America.\n\nInformation 5, also without a publication date, provides a detailed explanation of martial law, its meaning, history, and instances in the United States. The document mentions the case of Kahanamoku v. United States (1946), where martial law was declared in Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the army controlled every aspect of life in the islands.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-03-25, states that tanks are coming into U.S. towns in advance for martial law. However, the information provided contradicts this claim. Both Information 1 and 2, published before the claim, clarify that the movement of military tanks on a train near Moorpark, California, is not a sign of martial law being imposed in American towns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it is a part of normal military operations.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, as it is not supported by the provided information and seems to be based on misinformation or misunderstanding of the situation.", "response": "FALSE."}

Everyone’s just kinda fucking dying for it right now.” · Accompanying Grohl’s interview with NME was the announcement of a run of U.K. stadium shows, which are set to take place in June and July 2022.\nGrohl went on to say how the Foo Fighters have been doing their best to keep both themselves and their fans safe, following whatever guidelines are in place, from the federal level down to state and local protocols.

Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

There is currently no vaccine or medicine recommended to treat the coronavirus, and there is no evidence that high doses of vitamin C have any effect.\n\nInformation 2, published on January 27, 2020, is from PolitiFact and is a fact-checking article that states the claim that the coronavirus can be slowed or stopped with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C is false.\n\nInformation 3, published on February 12, 2020, is from FactCheck.org and states that there is no evidence that vitamin C can have an impact on COVID-19. The article also mentions that treatments billed as miracle cures have been spreading across the internet since the new coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December.\n\nInformation 4, publication date not specified, is from the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance and discusses the possible application of high-dose vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection. The article states that a high dose of vitamin C may be a proven therapeutic agent that not only ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation during coronavirus infection but also suppresses viral replication and improves antiviral immune defense and adrenal function.\n\nInformation 5, published on March 31, 2020, is from Plant Based News and quotes a British Dietetic Association spokesperson and Registered Dietitian, Claire Fudge, who states that there is no known evidence to support the claim that taking excessive amounts of Vitamin C by way of supplementation will prevent coronavirus.\n\nClaim:\n\nThe claim is that the coronavirus can be slowed or stopped with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus can be slowed or stopped with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C has been fact-checked and found to be false by multiple reputable sources, including PolitiFact and FactCheck.org. There is currently no vaccine or medicine recommended to treat the coronavirus, and there is no evidence that high doses of vitamin C have any effect.\n\nWhile there is some research that suggests high-dose vitamin C may have a therapeutic effect on coronavirus infection, this research is still in the early stages and has not been widely replicated or peer-reviewed. Therefore, it is not yet possible to say with certainty whether high-dose vitamin C is an effective treatment for coronavirus.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that the coronavirus can be slowed or stopped with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C is false. There is currently no evidence to support this claim, and it is not recommended to use high doses of vitamin C as a treatment for coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies. However, the abstract does not provide any details about the study or its findings.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2021, reports on a study conducted by researchers at Kansas State University and the Agricultural Research Service.

But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nCOVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nHome testing kits are available which can help confirm your infection and let you know when it is safe to be around others. Local health officials and their online portals can also advise you where to go for testing and treatment. Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.\nThe FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps: Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Covid-19 Testing | Shoppers Drug Mart®\nContent:\nYou are using an unsupported browser.

Whereas Article 77 of the Constitution provides for the extension of the tenure of parliament for six months in situations of war or an emergency, presidential elections are not mentioned under the same provision of the law.

The most radical opposition figures, such as Mr Besigye, say that Mr Museveni has such a tight grip that an election alone will never unseat him. Instead, they see the polls as the catalyst for a political crisis, or even a popular uprising. The deployment of armed militia to enforce the covid-19 curfew looks to some like a dress rehearsal for suppressing post-election protests.\nThat is as much as the average Ugandan makes in a year. Some opposition leaders want Mr Museveni to declare a state of emergency and postpone elections. The old soldier is disinclined to do so. His regime has built a civilian architecture over the hard foundations of military power.

Don Wanyama, Museveni’s press adviser, told AFP via phone that “the president does not have powers to postpone elections”. “That is silly, obviously.

Recently, a team of investigators affiliated with the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial — called Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment, Investigating Outpatients Nationwide, or ACTION for short — will involve human participants, and the researchers started recruiting on May 26, 2020.\nProctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future. Lastly, standard guidelines for the administration of the antibiotics must be established.\nBeović B, Dousak M, Ferreira-Coimbra J, et al. Antibiotic use in patients with COVID-19: a ‘snapshot’ Infectious Diseases International Research Initiative (ID-IRI) survey. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2020. https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa326.\nCurrently, there are no clear estimates on the incidence of bacterial co-infection in patients with COVID-19 and no clinical trials have been conducted on the use of empiric antibiotics in these patients [9]. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have been analyzed for their potential capacity to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro, blocking replication [19]. Furthermore, beta-lactam antibiotics are being evaluated in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but more clinical trials are necessary in order to properly evaluate results [20]. Some researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Episode #61 - COVID-19 & Antibiotics\nContent:\nSome of them might even be admitted to the intensive care units. But the problem is that with the large number of COVID-19 patients, the use of antibiotics by health care providers becomes more and more and more so there's excessive use of antibiotics when not needed.\nAntibiotics are pharmaceutical agents. They are medications that are useful in treating bacterial infections and not viral infections. And COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2, is a viral infection that can cause mild disease that where patients remain at home in the communities, or it can lead to moderate or severe disease where patients are admitted to the hospital. Some of them might even be admitted to the intensive care units.\nWhen are antibiotics prescribed in the course of COVID-19 treatment? Professor Hanan H.

And with COVID, there's a very large expansion in the number of patients with respiratory disease where patients might feel the urge to take an antibiotic, while in reality COVID is not a bacteria, it's a virus.\nVGS Thank you, Hanan.

There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

But experts are clear that this is a hoax and that petrol pumps have not been found to be a source of contagion in any case. The hoax seems to have started in England, where Public Health officials have slammed it as fake.\n“ACAPMA encourages all members to share the clear and simple advice from the Department of Health that all people should, after touching any hard surface, avoid touching their face and wash their hands as soon as possible.

Claims coronavirus is spreading through petrol pumps have been rubbished by health professionals today. It was feared Covid-19 was moving “rapidly” down the pumps and infecting drivers across the country. WhatsApp messages and posts on social media suggested a senior NHS nurse had advised people to wear gloves at petrol garages.\nBut a Public Health England spokesperson offered some clarity on this saying the pumps offer no more exposure than any other surface. \"Petrol pumps are no worse than other surfaces, although we do recommend people use gloves and wash their hands after using them,” they said today.\nOne such message read: \"A senior nurse at the Queen Elizabeth believes the virus is spreading rapidly through people using petrol pumps. \"She asks that if you need to fill your car up use gloves or a paper towel and then bin them. Please pass this on.\" More than 5,000 cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in the UK. This figure includes the 233 deaths of patients who were tested positive. But the majority of those had underlying health conditions, such as severe respiratory problems.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-27, is an AFP fact-checking article that discusses a claim about Australia's Department of Health issuing a warning that using petrol pumps can spread COVID-19. The claim is false, and no such warning has been issued by Australian health authorities.

That is, the first patient in Sub-Saharan Africa was diagnosed after contracting the semi-deadly illness.\nYou see, over on Black Twitter, folks are boasting that Black people are naturally safe from infection because we have melanin… and also ginger ale. somebody on FB asked how many black people got the coronavirus and this nigga gon comment and say “I been drinking ginger ale since they said that shit came over here” I am in tears 😭😭😭 · — Princess 👑 (@prennycombs3) February 26, 2020 · So let me get this straight.

They discuss a false claim that originated from a Facebook post stating \"people of color may be immune to the coronavirus because of melanin.\" The claim is fact-checked and debunked by PolitiFact. Melanin is a natural pigment that gives color to skin and eyes, but it does not offer increased protection against the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3 is from Johns Hopkins Medicine, published on 2022-02-17. It states that people of color are getting sick and dying of COVID-19 more than whites, providing evidence that contradicts the claim of immunity due to melanin.\n\nInformation 4 consists of articles from CityScrollz and the Zambian Observer, both published in February 2020. They discuss the narrative circulating on Black Twitter that Black people are naturally immune to coronavirus due to melanin. This information does not provide evidence to support or debunk the claim but shows that the claim was being spread on social media.\n\nInformation 5 is about Black Men Travels, a travel-related website. There is no content related to the claim or fact-checking.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that people of color may be immune to the coronavirus because of melanin is false. Multiple sources, including PolitiFact and Johns Hopkins Medicine, have debunked this claim. Melanin is a natural pigment that gives color to skin and eyes, but it does not offer increased protection against the coronavirus. In fact, people of color are getting sick and dying of COVID-19 more than whites.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was first published on Facebook on 2020-02-22, and it was quickly debunked by PolitiFact on the same day. Johns Hopkins Medicine published an article on 2022-02-17, providing evidence that people of color are getting sick and dying of COVID-19 more than whites.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nYes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: ...

Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe. This comprehensive search led to the identification of 13 regions of the human genome that appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection or severity.\nThe new study, published in the journal Nature, includes data collected through the initiative as of January 2021, and represents nearly 50,000 COVID-19 patients and another 2 million uninfected controls [1].

How does the immune system remember and recognize viral invaders it has encountered in the past? A trio of newly published studies of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated against the virus or both, are providing tantalizing new clues about the factors that influence the speed and magnitude of the immune system’s response to subsequent infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe three studies, published in Science Immunology and led by investigators at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, provide intriguing answers about how long COVID-19 immunity lasts and the nature of immune recall after infection, vaccination, or both.\nThe team analyzed the immune system’s response after infection, vaccination, and boosting by studying blood samples from individuals with different medical trajectories — those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but were not vaccinated, those who recovered from infection and were then vaccinated against COVID-19, or those who were never infected but had been vaccinated and boosted.\nIn addition, the researchers found evidence suggesting that memory of prior infection with common cold coronavirusesmild viruses that circulated before SARS-CoV-2—might be responsible for the robust, sustained immune response in a small subset of unvaccinated individuals who recover from COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity - PubMed\nContent:\nTherefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

In this paper, we explored vaccination narratives and challenges experienced and observed by Filipinos during the early vaccination period.\nIn this paper, we explored vaccination narratives and challenges experienced and observed by Filipinos during the early vaccination period. We interviewed 35 individuals from a subsample of 1,599 survey respondents 18 years and older in the Philippines. The interviews were conducted in Filipino, Cebuano, and/or English via online platforms such as Zoom or via phone call. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated, and analysed using inductive content analysis. To highlight the complex reasons for delaying and/or refusing COVID-19 vaccines, we embedded our findings within the social ecological model.\nAs early as the first phase of the pandemic, critical care capacity was overwhelmed with the influx of patients in hospitals [10, 11]. As of 16 September 2021, the Philippines ranks third among countries with the highest number of newly confirmed cases per one million population [1, 20]. Globally, 42.9% of the world population have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with much lower rates in LMICs like the Philippines [20, 21]. Only 55% of Filipinos have expressed willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and as of 16 September 2021, only 30% of the population have been fully vaccinated[21, 22].\nRecognising the multiple dimensions in which behaviours and decisions occur, theories and models have been proposed to explain how individuals make decisions on their health based on factors that change over time and context [25, 26]. The social ecological model provides a useful framework for investigating health behaviours and decisions by recognising that a multiplicity of factors interacts to influence health of individuals [26]. These include individual factors representing biological or behavioural characteristics, interpersonal factors representing networks and social capital operating within a defined boundary, and structural factors that include health systems and are mediated through laws and policies [26]. Published studies on vaccination that utilised this model reported that vaccine intentions and attitudes operate along multiple dimensions, with a series of events influencing decisions related to vaccination [17, 27, 28].

The continued controversy surrounding Denvgaxia during the COVID‐19 pandemic is likely further eroding vaccine confidence, as lingering governance issues continue to erode trust in the government.\nUnsurprisingly, a nationally representative survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS), a private non‐profit polling body, conducted in September 2020 revealed that about one‐third of Filipinos demonstrate vaccine hesitancy when asked about Dengvaxia. 22 Another survey by SWS from April to May 2021, showed that a similar share of Filipinos demonstrates hesitancy against any COVID‐19 vaccine.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on April 28 that the group behind the Fabunan vaccine has not applied for registration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so the vaccine cannot be used.\nThe drug remains to be unregistered at the FDA as of April 28.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-07-07\nTitle: Pinoy scientists must work double-time to develop Covid-19 vax ...\nContent:\nMeanwhile, Duterte said he would continue to pray for the success of ongoing efforts for the local production of Covid-19 vaccines. “I am also praying at the same time that they can come up with good results of their studies and make some vaccines that are really, truly Filipino,” he said.\nMANILA – Filipino scientists should work double-time to develop their own Covid-19 vaccines so the country would no longer have to rely on supplies from abroad, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday. Duterte encouraged Filipino scientists to do everything to develop their own vaccines especially since new Covid-19 variants are starting to emerge in more countries.\nDuterte encouraged Filipino scientists to do everything to develop their own vaccines especially since new Covid-19 variants are starting to emerge in more countries. “Our scientists must work double the time…Mag-isip talaga kayo. If you have to pour your, ano, matutunaw yung utak ninyo (You really have to think. If you have to pour your, your brain will melt). You must come up with something to help the Filipino,” he said in a pre-recorded meeting with Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) executives and other government officials at Malago Clubhouse in Malacañang, Manila on Monday night.\nHe said he believes the Filipino scientists have the capability to be Covid-19 vaccine self-reliant, noting that the government has allotted enough funds for the purpose.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides context about the COVID-19 vaccination situation in the Philippines as of September 16, 2021. The country ranks third in the highest number of newly confirmed cases per one million population. Only 55% of Filipinos have expressed willingness to be vaccinated, and only 30% of the population have been fully vaccinated. The social ecological model is used to understand the factors influencing health behaviors and decisions, including individual, interpersonal, and structural factors.\n\nInformation 2 highlights the importance of proper communication through trusted sources to enforce the value of the COVID-19 vaccine. Local health workers, the WHO, and scientists are the most trusted sources for Filipinos regarding COVID-19 news and information. A nationally representative survey in September 2020 revealed that about one-third of Filipinos demonstrate vaccine hesitancy, and a similar share shows hesitancy against any COVID-19 vaccine in April-May 2021. Only around 32% of Filipinos are willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 3 discusses a Filipino-born Dominican microbiologist's claim about a possible Covid-19 vaccine due to the positive impacts of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating patients in France. An HCQ-based vaccine would be beneficial for Filipinos due to its low cost and availability.\n\nInformation 4 is a fact-check that disproves a story claiming a Filipino scientist, Willie Fabunan, has discovered a cure for COVID-19. The so-called \"Fabunan vaccine\" has not been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of April 28, 2020.\n\nInformation 5 emphasizes the need for Filipino scientists to develop their own Covid-19 vaccines to reduce reliance on foreign supplies. President Rodrigo Duterte encourages scientists to work double-time, especially since new COVID-19 variants are emerging. Duterte believes Filipino scientists have the capability to be self-reliant in COVID-19 vaccine production, with enough funds allocated for the purpose.\n\nCLAIM Analysis:\n\nThe claim that \"A Filipino scientist has produced a vaccine for COVID-19\" is false based on the available information. Information 4 explicitly states that the story about Willie Fabunan's discovery of a COVID-19 cure and the so-called \"Fabunan vaccine\" is false. Additionally, Information 3 discusses a different Filipino scientist's claim about a possible vaccine based on HCQ, but this has not been proven or registered as a vaccine.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]].

Remarkably, the cGAS-STING pathway has been recently reported as a critical driver of aberrant type-I IFN responses in severe cases of COVID-19, a disease caused by an RNA virus, not a DNA virus [112]. Given that strict compartmentalization of cellular DNA in the nucleus and mitochondria is necessary to avoid sensing self-DNA, the source of cytosolic immunostimulatory DNA following SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown but could be explained by LINE-1 driven reverse transcription fo\nThese findings should not be overlooked in light of the growing number of cases of acute myocarditis and myopericarditis reported in mRNA vaccine recipients, particularly in young males following the second dose [120], [121], [122], which led the FDA to issue a warning on the increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following the second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.3 Considering that the human TREX1 gene exhibits mutations and that TREX1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been related to severe outcome of infectious disease [123] and autoimmune conditions [124] in humans, it is possible that polymorphisms in TREX1 and in other genes that encode proteins that directly or indirectly regulate cytosolic DNA sensors, may determine susceptibility to nms-mRNA vaccines, influence response to immunization, and influence susceptibility to severe inflammatory disorders, including myocarditis, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Our hypothesis must be tested experimentally usi\nIn addition, the pro-inflammatory status and the activation of intracellular RNA and DNA sensors would unsilence endogenous retroelements. These molecular events would increase the risk of genomic, chromosomal, and cellular instability, and carcinogenesis. Although mouse models of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [127], SARS-CoV [128], and influenza [129] show vigorous induction of type-I and -III IFNs, the involvement of these cytokines in COVID-19 patients is contentious.\nHence, individuals with particular genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode DNA sensors, such as TREX1, that are exposed to cellular stress and inflammatory stimuli related to the nms-mRNA and to the accumulation of DNA following up-regulation of TEs, may be at more risk of developing severe inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and carcinogenesis. If this is so, then the ‘one size fits all’ approach of mass vaccination using nms-mRNA technology would not be a safe public health measure for humanity. If our hypothesis were to be confirmed, the implications for public health would be staggering and appalling in the context of the mass-scale COVID-19 vaccination already taking place, particularly if the nms-mRNA enters brain [82], bone marrow [84], and – if already present in the vaccinee – cancerous or pre-cancerous cells [143], or if the vaccine is administered to females early in their pregnancy and the nms-mRNA transfects embryonic cells [77].

The mRNA from the vaccine is broken down quickly and cannot affect or combine with DNA in any way.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is from UNICEF, stating that the COVID-19 vaccine does not change human DNA. The genetic material in the vaccine does not penetrate the nucleus, where DNA is kept, and cannot harm the body or change the structure of the DNA chain.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-09-27, is from the CDC, addressing myths and facts about COVID-19 vaccines. It confirms that vaccines do not change or interact with DNA, and currently, there is no evidence that vaccines cause fertility problems.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a hypothesis paper discussing potential health risks of mRNA-based vaccine therapy. It suggests that genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode proteins regulating cytosolic DNA sensors may determine susceptibility to mRNA vaccines and influence response to immunization, potentially leading to severe inflammatory disorders and carcinogenesis.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that \"COVID-19 does not kill anyone. The vaccine can alter your DNA and cause loss of fertility and homosexuality\" is false.\n\nScientific evidence from reliable sources, such as government health departments and the CDC, confirms that COVID-19 vaccines do not alter DNA or cause fertility problems. The mRNA from the vaccine is broken down quickly and cannot affect or combine with DNA in any way. The claim about homosexuality is not supported by any scientific evidence and is considered to be a false assertion.", "response": "FALSE."}

The claim originated from a YouTube video by Dr. Anacleto Belleza Millendez, who advised drinking clean semen or using it as a hand sanitizer to prevent COVID-19 infection. The video also cites a 2016 study by the Pasteur Institute, which actually investigated the effects of spermine and spermidine (found in human semen) on Zika and Chikungunya viruses, not COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-21, is a record in the #CoronavirusFacts database, confirming that there is no official or authorized cure for COVID-19, and the study cited by Millendez did not mention COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, discusses a study about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and the potential for sexual transmission. The study found that SARS-CoV-2 is undetectable in the semen of recovering patients with COVID-19 after one month of diagnosis, indicating that sexual transmission is not possible from convalescent patients.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-05-07, is a cohort study examining the clinical characteristics of men with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) whose semen tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that clean semen is a cure for COVID-19 is false, as confirmed by multiple fact-checks (Information 1 and 4) and the absence of any scientific evidence supporting this claim. Additionally, the study cited by Millendez does not support his claim, as it focused on the effects of spermine and spermidine on Zika and Chikungunya viruses, not COVID-19 (Information 1 and 2). Furthermore, there is no official or authorized cure for COVID-19 (Information 2). Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 is undetectable in the semen of recovering patients with COVID-19 after one month of diagnosis, indicating that sexual transmission is not possible from convalescent patients (Information 3).", "response": "FALSE."}

Second, the duration of each study phase was 10 minutes, which was chosen to provide adequate time to observe physiologic changes but not require people to volunteer more than 90 minutes of their time. Though the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.\nThough the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.

Various scientific studies (we’ll get to those in a moment) have shown zinc lozenges to be effective in shortening the misery phase of common colds. So in the face of a coronavirus pandemic, here’s a big question many are asking: can zinc shorten the duration of – or even diminish the symptom load and thereby lessen the impact – of COVID-19?\nI expect COVID-19 will be inhibited similarly, but I have no direct experimental support for this claim.

Higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes coincide with populations with chronic diseases and elderly who are at risk of zinc deficiency. Through several mechanisms zinc may prevent, reduce severity and duration of symptoms.\nThe proposed protective mechanisms of zinc in Covid-19. From “Zinc and respiratory tract infections: Perspectives for COVID‑19 (Review)” by Skalny, A.V., Rink, L., Ajsuvakova O. et al. 2020 in the International Journal of Molecular Medicine; Volume 46, Issue 1, page 21.\nThe effectiveness of zinc in preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infections is yet to be systematically evaluated and, along with other nutritional supplements, was not mentioned in a recent narrative review of TCIM for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [55]. The findings of systematic reviews of related populations are promising; however, the reviews are limited by population, intervention, or are out of date [56], [57], [58].\nA 2016 Cochrane review of six RCTs concluded zinc supplementation was effective for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months [57]. Unlike an earlier review in 2000 of seven RCTs with adult participants and one RCT with children [59], an updated 2011 systematic review of 13 RCTs found a dose-dependent effect of zinc lozenges compared to placebo controls for reduced duration of common colds in adults [60]. Daily dosages less than 75 mg of zinc had no significant effect on duration of colds, however, daily dosage over 75 mg reduced the duration of colds by 42 % (95 % CI: 35 %–48 %). In a subsequent 2017 systematic review of seven RCTs of zinc lozenges with a daily dose >75 mg, a smaller reduction of 33 % (95 % CI 21 %–45 %) in the duration of common colds was found [61]. No differences in duration were found for daily doses of 192−207 mg compared to doses of 80−92 mg.

A plane carrying 117,000 Pfizer/BioNTech doses landed at Bogota’s El Dorado Airport Monday, arriving as many in the region grow impatient over the slow pace of the COVAX vaccine rollout. “Today marks a very important milestone,” Colombian President Iván Duque said.\nColombia reached an agreement in October to purchase 20 million doses through the COVAX initiative, enough to vaccinate 10 million people, or about one-fifth of the country’s population. But like many in Latin America, the Andean nation has scrambled to obtain more doses as the COVAX rollout drags on.\nWith more than 50 million confirmed cases and 1.2 million deaths, countries in the Americas are among the hardest hit by COVID-19, and the WHO estimates the region will have to vaccinate nearly 700 million people in order to contain the pandemic — a feat that at the current rate would be many months away. Still, health officials were praising Monday’s shipment as an important first step. “The arrival of these first doses in Colombia through the COVAX Facility is an encouraging step in the fight against this virus in the Americas,” said Carissa F.\nBesides Colombia, Peru, El Salvador and Bolivia are expected to receive doses as part of the first vaccine deployment.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\nPeople can become infected if they have close contact with an infected animal or its body fluids (such as saliva or urine)—this initial spread from an animal to a person is known as a spillover event. Once it spreads to people, person-to-person spread of NiV can also occur.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India.

The study found that 8% of participants consumed chlorine dioxide as prevention and 16% as treatment. Certain factors were associated with chlorine dioxide consumption, such as being male, having a health sciences student in the family, using medical information as the main source of COVID-19 information, having comorbidities for COVID-19, considering COVID-19 dangerous and deadly, using medications and plants to prevent COVID-19, considering chlorine dioxide ineffective, and being uninformed of its efficacy.\n\nInformation 2 is a warning from the FDA and FTC about a company selling chlorine dioxide products as a treatment or prevention for COVID-19. The FDA has previously warned consumers not to purchase or consume chlorine dioxide, which is a powerful bleaching agent when mixed with citric acid. The FDA and FTC requested that the company respond in 48 hours describing the specific steps it has taken to correct the violations.\n\nInformation 3 is a fact-check from Poynter, published on July 8, 2020, stating that consuming chlorine dioxide does not cure the coronavirus. The chemical compound is harmful and has been promoted for commercial purposes since the 1990s. The World Health Organization (WHO) has not shown any medicine to prevent or cure the disease.\n\nInformation 4 is an article from an unknown date, stating that chlorine dioxide kits are sold online under various names and are often referred to as MMS. The FDA has warned consumers not to purchase or consume chlorine dioxide, which is a powerful bleaching agent when mixed with citric acid.\n\nInformation 5 is an article from March 31, 2020, discussing the possibility of chlorine dioxide preventing the spreading of coronavirus or other viruses. The article states that chlorine dioxide will certainly inactivate the virus, but it does not mention anything about consuming chlorine dioxide as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that consuming chlorine dioxide cures the coronavirus is false. Information 3, which is a fact-check from Poynter, published on July 8, 2020, states that consuming chlorine dioxide does not cure the coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has not shown any medicine to prevent or cure the disease. Additionally, Information 2, which is a warning from the FDA and FTC, states that chlorine dioxide is a powerful bleaching agent when mixed with citric acid and can have adverse reactions, especially in children. Therefore, it is not recommended to consume chlorine dioxide as a treatment for COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

How it moved from bats to humans in the fall of 2019 has not yet been determined, but scientists suspect an intermediary animal that humans handled as part of market-driven consumption of wild meat products.12 Similarly, in the fall of 1910, humans encountered the bacillus that causes plague, Yersinia pestis, when markets spurred exploitation of animals on another Asian borderland, a part of northeastern China on t\nAs we find today in US public opinion about government responses to COVID-19, in 1911 there were strong differences of opinion in China about the policies used to control the plague. Some Chinese observers reacted with shock at the violence of “Western medicine” and saw its methods as nothing more than a foreign assault on the bodies of Chinese people. Some claimed that thousands died not from the plague but as a result of the plague control measures themselves.24 By stark contrast, other Chinese observers embraced plague control policies as the new scientific standard for modern government and praised the Qing court for aggressively adopting even the most horrifying of foreign techniques.\nGiven China’s apparent success in controlling the spread of the virus, it is not surprising that some Chinese observers suggest that the global tables are turning. China was known as the “Sick Man of Asia” in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but elements in China today are now portraying the United States as the “Sick Man of the West.” In April, an essay in the PRC state-backed Global Times attacked the hypocrisy of using the “Sick Man” label to describe China’s response to the coronavirus, stating that instead “incompetence will be the one word other countries pin on the US, the Trump administration in particular.”33 PRC Web sites proclaim that “America is the real sick man of the western world” and warn that the world “should be wary of the American virus.”34 Bloggers single out Trump as “the genuine Sick Man of America.”35 Chinese social media even boasts a hashtag, “#Meiguo bingfu” (American Sick Man), that has received millions of views.36\nReading the essay today reveals a deep, sad irony: in February 2020, the Wall Street Journal and most observers in the West were highly critical of China’s handling of the virus but absolutely failed to consider that the United States would fare much worse. The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths (as contentious as those numbers might be for some) show how different our reality is today: as of the writing of this article, the PRC (with a population of 1.4 billion) has reported 90 509 cases and 4739 deaths, whereas the United States (with a population of 330 million) has reported 7 156 562 cases and 205 268 deaths.32\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-10\nTitle: Trump's False Claim on Tijuana Coronavirus Cases - FactCheck.org\nContent:\nTrump, May 28: Mexico is having a very, very hard time, as you know, with COVID, especially along the border … with Tijuana and various places along the border.

It mentions the zoonotic origin of both diseases and the differences in public opinion regarding government responses to the plague in China. The article also highlights the current situation of COVID-19 in the US and China, with the US having a higher number of cases and deaths compared to China.\n\nInformation 2 focuses on Trump's false claims about Tijuana's coronavirus cases and the construction of the border wall. It provides data from Johns Hopkins University as of June 10, 2020, which shows that Mexico had 124,301 cases and 14,649 deaths, while the US had 1,973,230 cases and 111,694 deaths.\n\nInformation 3 is about the US's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mistakes made by the government. It highlights the fact that the virus had been circulating in China since November and had already reached several US states before the first official case was detected.\n\nInformation 4 mentions that Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador expressed concern about a \"virus spreading\" in Mexico, but he was not referring to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5 discusses the impact of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare workers in Mexico City and Tijuana.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim states that the COVID-19 pandemic has been tough on Mexico, and the border wall has helped prevent the spread of the virus in the US.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nThe claim is partially correct and partially exaggerated. According to Information 2, Trump's claim about Tijuana's coronavirus cases was false, and the US has more cases and deaths than Mexico. However, Information 2 also states that Mexico has been hit hard by COVID-19, which supports the claim. Regarding the border wall, Information 2 states that the wall has been completed in some areas, but it is unclear whether it has prevented the spread of the virus. Therefore, the claim that the wall has helped prevent the spread of the virus is exaggerated and lacks sufficient evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is partially true and partially exaggerated. The COVID-19 pandemic has indeed been tough on Mexico, but the claim that the border wall has helped prevent the spread of the virus is exaggerated and lacks sufficient evidence.", "response": "FALSE."}

How BAME women navigate maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a vigilant review of their needs on an individual basis. This is particularly relevant for hard-to-reach women, such as recent immigrants and asylum seekers, who may encounter difficulties accessing or engaging with maternity services. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess and highlight the challenges faced by pregnant BAME women during the pandemic.\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women in the UK have increased maternal mortality rates compared to other groups of women. Unfortunately, according to preliminary findings, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to mortality rates for BAME women, raising concerns that pregnant BAME women are facing greater health disparities during the pandemic.

The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nYou might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.\nIn January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: Scientists find COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly\nContent:\nBy clicking \"Allow All\" you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage and support us in providing free open access scientific content.

Previous findings indicate that antibodies to those viruses last at least a year and often longer, they said. In combination with certain previous findings on COVID-19 antibodies, the researchers concluded that their results \"might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 'immunity passports' and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups and widespread testing.\"\nAmid Omicron, relative to participants without long COVID, those with long COVID at 2 years had significantly higher rates of reinfection and pneumonia. ...

The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nIn the recent study published in Science, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a database of immune responses from 30,000 New Yorkers who tested positive for the coronavirus between March and October and monitored 121 volunteers over time.\nIn the U.K. study, scientists at Imperial College London found that antibody prevalence in the British participants fell from 6 percent at roughly the end of June to 4.4 percent in September. And using at-home tests that were distributed to more than 365,000 people, the researchers observed a more than 26 percent decline in antibody levels over three months.\nBut despite the seemingly divergent results from the two studies, they can both be true, according to Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the molecular microbiology and immunology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not unreasonable — or particularly alarming — if antibody levels decline rapidly after a person recovers and then persist for some time at a much lower level, he said.\nBelgian student Lili Deneve, who has recovered from Covid-19, donates plasma at the Belgian Red Cross blood collection center in Brussels on Oct. 27, 2020.Francois Lenoir / Reuters ...

Could it be possible that SARS-CoV-2 is the big exception to the rule? To date, there is no strong evidence (i.e., evidence based on causal research) that smokers are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nIn France, researchers first suggested that nicotine may play a role in protecting smokers9, triggering a run on nicotine products among the general public. Interestingly, the lead author of this research has been funded by the tobacco industry in the past, and also other researchers who have made similar claims can be linked with the tobacco industry, indicating a possible conflict of interest. According to the Global Center for Good Governance in Tobacco Control, the tobacco industry was actively involved in downplaying the role of smoking in COVID-19 by spreading claims that smoking or vaping protects against COVID-1910.\nA number of recent studies have found low percentages of smokers among COVID-19 patients, causing scientists to conclude that smokers may be protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm. Conclusions: There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking.\nMaterial and methods: The latest available scientific publications were reviewed until November 14, 2020, from the PubMed platform. Results: Nicotine is a cholinergic agonist and pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibitor. Some authors present that smoking and nicotine reduce the amount of the ACE2 receptors which are used by the novel coronavirus to enter cells, while others claim that ACE2 receptors are upregulated in smokers.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its ...\nContent:\nBackground There is a lot of debate about the effects of <strong>smoking</strong> on COVID-19.

It mentions that there is no strong evidence supporting the claim that smokers are protected against the virus. Some studies have found low percentages of smokers among COVID-19 patients, but there is a possibility of conflict of interest as some researchers promoting this idea have ties with the tobacco industry.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the potential role of nicotine in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection. While nicotine has properties that could potentially mitigate the cytokine storm, researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic. The review of scientific publications found conflicting evidence regarding the impact of smoking on ACE2 receptors.\n\nInformation 3 mentions a fixed-effects meta-analysis that found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients. However, other studies have reported an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients.\n\nInformation 4 is a scientific paper published in April 2021 that identified several biases in a study claiming that smokers are less likely to acquire Covid-19, suggesting that smoking is not protective against the virus.\n\nInformation 5 is a study record manager for NCBI and does not contain relevant information to the claim.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that smoking protects against coronavirus is not accurate.

The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China. The article states that there is no explanation for this claim and suggests that it is not accurate to compare Macedonia to China in this way.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-02-26, reports that North Macedonia has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-22, is an article debunking the claim that North Macedonia has not received medical help from the European Union.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-04, reports that North Macedonia has experienced a new spike in coronavirus cases, with 101 new cases reported on Wednesday.\n\nInformation 5 is a social briefing about the gambling industry in North Macedonia, with no specific publication date. It discusses the rise of the gambling industry in the country and the impact it has had on the local population.\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China is likely false. Information 1, which was published on the same day as the claim, states that there is no evidence to support this claim and suggests that it is not accurate to compare Macedonia to China in this way. Additionally, the other information provided does not support the claim, as it focuses on the coronavirus situation in North Macedonia and the gambling industry in the country.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to classify the claim as FALSE based on the available information and the lack of evidence to support it.", "response": "FALSE."}

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %). Countries with high values in spring 2020 recorded high excess mortality rates again in November 2020: Belgium (58.8 %), Italy (51.6 %), Austria (47.3 %), Malta (40.2 %), France (31.3 %) and Spain (24.4 %).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A ...\nContent:\nFrance’s deaths began around mid-March but the rate was slower than for Italy and Spain.

In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown. In Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.\nIn Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.

In an absence of an abundant supply of masks — which, by the way, also need to be worn properly to provide protection — both the WHO and CDC stressed how important social distancing was. “COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact with one another,” the CDC said in a statement.\nThrough their data collection, the team found that about 75% of people who were initially classified as “asymptomatic” went on to develop symptoms, she said. This matches up with the CDC’s findings at the nursing facility in Washington. Of the 13 positive patients who initially reported no symptoms during testing,10 later developed symptoms. But ultimately, the only way to really find out how many asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are out there would be to conduct blood tests across large swaths of the population to look for antibodies, which are a type of protein that provide evidence that a person’s immune system did battle with the coronavirus.\nShould we start wearing masks to the grocery store? At the same time, my colleagues were scrutinizing guidelines at various workplaces and agencies we cover: The New York City Fire Department told workers on March 19 they were to come to work, so long as they had no symptoms, even if they had had “close contact with someone who is a known positive COVID-19 patient,” according to a document obtained by ProPublica.

Their immune systems had fought off the coronavirus, whether they'd known they were infected or not – and many apparently didn't.\nBlood tests that check for exposure to the coronavirus are starting to come online, and preliminary findings suggest that many people have been infected without knowing it. Even people who do eventually experience the common symptoms of COVID-19 don't start coughing and spiking fevers the moment they're infected. William Petri is a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Virginia who specializes in infectious diseases. Here, he runs through what's known and what isn't about asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\nHere, he runs through what's known and what isn't about asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. In general, having an infection without any symptoms is common. Perhaps the most infamous example was Typhoid Mary, who spread typhoid fever to other people without having any symptoms herself in the early 1900s. My colleagues and I have found that many infections are fought off by the body without the person even knowing it.\nIt takes a little time for the immune system to rally that defense, so some cases are more aptly considered presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic.

In young people, it has been suggested that their strong immune status protects against COVID-19 severity.\nIn young people, it has been suggested that their strong immune status protects against COVID-19 severity. We hypothesise that asymptomatic carriers, either children or adults, should be vigilant as they are capable of transmitting COVID-19 during the incubation period without showing any signs or symptoms.\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis supports the notion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and person-to-person transmission and suggests that this is dependent on the varying viral incubation period among individuals.

Some hospitals that do not provide adequate PPE still restrict the providers from using PPE they own and bring to the hospital.\nAlthough some providers have lived apart from their families, it is recommended that providers continue to stay at home with their families [33-35]. This preserves everyone’s mental health. Providers should carefully follow standard precautions including utilization of appropriate PPE at work and washing hands as indicated. On arriving home they may change clothes. They should avoid sharing utensils and items of personal use.\nAccording to unpublished accounts, as of 23rd April 2020, more than 21,800 U.S. providers had contracted COVID-19 and 71 had died. This very high risk causes psychological distress among the providers [5]. It is especially so among younger and more junior workers and those with dependent children [5]. Risk factors for providers contracting COVID-19 include inadequate handwashing, inadequate or improper use of PPE, and prolonged work hours and exposure [6]. Infected providers are vectors for infection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-20\nTitle: COVID-19 and PPE: Some of Us Will Die\nContent:\nBut the new fear is the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The analogy of a coming storm is apt. It's as if we can now feel the winds and see the dark clouds. But even as we begin to see patients with COVID-19, and some hospitals in hot spots feel the surge, we won't be fully protected against the contagious virus.\nBut even as we begin to see patients with COVID-19, and some hospitals in hot spots feel the surge, we won't be fully protected against the contagious virus. Numerous colleagues have direct messaged (DM) me on Twitter that their hospital is rationing PPE and supplies are running short. C. Michael Gibson, MD, tweeted that he has received 10 DMs about shortages of masks.\nA storm is coming, and the new fear is the shortage of personal protective equipment, warns John Mandrola, MD, of the COVID19 pandemic as some hospitals bar physicians from complaining.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Critical Supply Shortages — The Need for Ventilators and Personal ...\nContent:\nCurrent estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.2 No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months. Equally worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death3 partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.4\nThe situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million.1 The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilator\n\nInformation 1, published around May-July 2020, discusses the factors contributing to the PPE shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights issues such as the reliance on markets for PPE distribution, the profit motive, and the lack of government capacity to maintain and distribute stockpiles. The text also cites data about healthcare workers who have been infected or died due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, with an unknown publication date, mentions the shortage of PPE and its consequences for healthcare professionals, who are at risk of infection due to the shortage. The text also mentions hospital administrators trying to downplay the issue.\n\nInformation 3, published around April 2020, discusses the PPE shortage in detail, mentioning the inadequate supply of PPE, especially N95 respirators, and the high costs. The text also highlights the disputes between healthcare providers and hospitals regarding appropriate PPE usage and reuse.\n\nInformation 4, published on March 20, 2020, focuses on the shortage of personal protective equipment and its consequences for healthcare professionals.

The information presented in all the sources indicates that there was a severe shortage of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic, putting healthcare professionals at risk of infection and death. The shortage was due to various factors, including the reliance on markets for distribution, the lack of government capacity to maintain and distribute stockpiles, and the high demand for PPE due to the pandemic.", "response": "TRUE."}
