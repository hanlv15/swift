Lessons from Covid-19 and OMAG position paper ...\nContent:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), on 30 January 2020, announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of 30 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 199 countries and territories. In the earlier part of the epidemic, the most cases were reported from China or among individuals with travel history to China.[5] However by the end of March 2020, the number of cases in China declined while the number of cases from Europe and the USA has increased and overtaken the total numbers reported by China.\nEpidemics will raise shortages as in current case, a shortage of masks, sanitizers etc., Industry should be prepared to respond to the challenge by escalating the production of all the protective measures required. Mission-critical enterprises need practical plans to continue to operate and respond to the needs of the public during epidemics.\nCT imaging was rolled out in China as a frontline diagnostic tool. In a study of 1014 patients with both CT chest and PCR, the sensitivity of CT was 97% relative to positive RT-PCR and its introduction led to a surge in diagnosed cases in Hubei, China. It led to rapid diagnosis as RT-PCR results had a delay (24-48 hours).[11]\nThis is equally important as happened during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemics in West Africa; more people died because of disruptions of day-to-day healthcare than died from Ebola.[9] Technology needs to become much more accessible, and with strengthened primary care patients with chronic conditions can be managed in primary care settings in case there are disruptions at tertiary care level.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Toward better pandemic preparedness\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made the economic case for investing in health abundantly clear. Going forward, we must view health security as an investment rather than a cost; consider that by 2025, COVID-19 will have a global economic burden of $16–$35 trillion, according to estimates from McKinsey & Company and an independent G20 panel. If better preparedness reduced this cost even modestly, the return on investment, in absolute terms, would be substantial (Chart 2).\nInvesting in health care and strengthening delivery systems will ensure we are better prepared to respond to the next global health challenge. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index ranked the United States as the country best prepared to manage an infectious disease outbreak and the United Kingdom as the next best prepared. Two years after the pandemic erupted, the United States has endured the highest global death toll from COVID-19, with more than 700,000 deaths, while the United Kingdom has recorded seven times more deaths than the 20,000 that its government chief scientific adviser suggested in March 2020 would be a “good outcome.” The Global Health Security rankings, based on more than one hundred questions about dozens of indicators and sub-indicators, were no match for the novel coronavirus.\nBenjamin Franklin once famously said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” He also warned, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” The importance of prevention has been all too evident in the catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic: so many lives lost, livelihoods disrupted, and economies shuttered. The pandemic has been painful, and it has been humbling, shattering expectations of which countries were best prepared for such a public health emergency.\nSuccesses and failures in the COVID-19 pandemic have shown us what we must do to be better prepared for the next pandemic. And, as Benjamin Franklin warned, if we fail to prepare for that event, we must be prepared to fail again—and to suffer the consequences.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-03\nTitle: Covid in the U.S.: Latest Maps, Case and Death Counts - The New ...\nContent:\nConfirmed cases and deaths, which are widely considered to be an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test.

Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology, noted that not much has been done to protect the most frail individuals living in nursing homes in North America. “I think that it’s kind of crazy that we [hadn’t] previously developed ways to robustly rapidly test people who work in nursing homes, to prevent them bringing in respiratory viruses,” he said.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-02, is an article discussing the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

In a 100 people case study, NO levels were found to be lower in pregnant women [53]. Gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes are also a common occurrence in pregnant women, with a higher chance of co-occurring, and both can increase the severity of COVID-19 [54]. A recent study has found that red blood cells from women with preeclampsia cause endothelial dysfunction ex vivo due to a deficiency in NO that can be reversed by treatment of the cells with sodium nitrite solution [55]. NOS2/iNOS was originally described as an enzyme that is expressed in activated macrophages and that generates nitric oxide (NO) from the amino acid L-arginine, thereby contributing to the control of replication or killing of intracellular microbial pathogens.\n[91] found that NO synthesis inhibition by intraperitoneal L-NAME administration increases airway resistance in rats, resulting in increased work of breathing (the amount of energy needed by the respiratory muscles to produce enough ventilation and respiration to meet the metabolic demands of the body).In vitro, L-NAME treatment of human whole blood resulted in increased clotting and fibrinogenesis, a result consistent with the inhibitory effects of NO on platelet function and of the platelet-aggregating properties of NOS inhibitors [92]. Angelis et al. found that prolonged administration of L-NAME to rats through drinking water causes impairment in cardiac output, as well as drops in venous oxygen saturation during exercise versus untreated animals [93]. Nasal NO levels have been shown to have a connection with olfactory senses, as an airborne messenger and as an anti-infectious agent in the nose and sinuses, and to contribute to the mucociliary clearance [94].

Having successfully developed a nutritional formulation intervention based on nitrate, a nitric oxide precursor, the authors hypothesis is that both the comorbidities associated with negative clinical patient outcomes and symptoms associated with COVID-19 sickness are linked to the depletion of a simple molecule: nitric oxide.\nHowever, while it is well known that correlation does not necessarily equal causation, and that just this one link could be overlooked as a mere coincidence, it is the correlation with all the other major COVID-19 comorbidities and low levels of nitric oxide that may establish a more than coincidental link.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule that is vital to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and immunological systems.

In 1948, there was rising agitation in East Bengal against the omission of Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz Khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of repression while charging protesters.\nOn 23 June 1949, Bengali nationalists from East Bengal broke away from the Muslim League, Pakistan's dominant political party, and established the All Pakistan Awami Muslim League. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Shamsul Huq were elected the first president and general secretary of the party respectively, Ataur Rahman Khan was elected the vice-president, Yar Mohammad Khan was elected as the treasurer, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and A. K. Rafiqul Hussain were elected the party's first joint secretaries. The party was formed to champion the rights of the masses in Pakistan against the powerful feudal establishment led by the Muslim League.\nVeteran student leader and language movement stalwart Khaleque Nawaz Khan defeated incumbent prime minister of the then East Bengal Mr. Nurul Amin in a landslide margin. Mr. Nurul Amin was defeated in his home Nandail constituency. Khaleque Nawaz Khan created history at age 27 by defeating sitting prime minister and Muslim League was wiped out from political landscape of the then East Pakistan. A. K. Fazlul Huq assumed the office of Chief Minister of East Bengal and drew up a cabinet containing many of the prominent student activists that were leading movements against the Pakistani state.\nInspiring from Soviet and Indian economic models, Awami League under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman implemented an economic system based on strict protectionism, state intervention and economic regulation under a planned economy and limited market activities, which was characterized as \"neither capitalist nor socialist\" in nature. Since Sheikh Hasina became the leader of Awami League in 1981, the party begun espousing more economically liberal positions, and has moved closer to the centre of the political spectrum. In 1991, AL president and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina noted that socialism was a failed system.\nThe Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ আওয়ামী লীগ, romanized: Bānglādēsh Awāmī Līg, lit.

War ensued and East Pakistan became Peoples Republic of Bangladesh on 26 March 1971. After 1971 in Pakistan (West) the PPP led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took power. 1977 Bhutto was removed by General Ziaul Haq through a coup. 1988, after the death of Pakistan's military ruler and later civilian President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a new Muslim League was formed under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, but it had no connection with the original Muslim League.\nThe Muslim League was the original successor of the All-India Muslim League that led the Pakistan Movement to achieve an independent nation. Five of the country's Prime Ministers have been affiliated with this party, namely Liaquat Ali Khan, Khwaja Nazimuddin, M. A. Bogra, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, and I. I. Chundrigar. The Muslim League was defeated in the 1955 elections to the Constituent Assembly by a political alliance known as the United Front.\nThe All-India Muslim League was disbanded in December 1947 and succeeded by two organisations, the Muslim League and the Indian Union Muslim League, the first being its original successor in Pakistan. Jinnah resigned as the president of the Muslim League on 17 December and the two Muslim Leagues respectively elected Ch. Khaliquzzaman as President of the Muslim League (Pakistan) and Muhammad Ismail as the president for Indian Union Muslim League.\nThe party was dissolved in 1958 after the declaration of Martial Law by General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the Commander-in-Chief of Pakistan Army. ...

The BPML leader Abul Hashim considered the resolution at the Delhi Convention of the Muslim Legislators for 'a Muslim state' as a 'betrayal' to their interests. Within two years of achieving Independence, the League began to lose popular support. In the mean time maulana abdul hamid khan bhasani and other prominent Muslim Leaguers formed the Awami Muslim League in Dhaka in 1949.\nThe League performance in other Muslim dominated provinces of India was equally enthusiastic besides the North West Frontier Province which was still under the Congress influence. The performance of the League in the elections of 1946 made its leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah the undisputed leader of the Indian Muslims.\nThe performance of the League in the elections of 1946 made its leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah the undisputed leader of the Indian Muslims. So far as the Muslim community was concerned, Jinnah was now inevitably to be consulted with in all negotiations and agreements concerning the transfer of power by the British. Six years after the Lahore Resolution, HS Suhrahardy moved the resolution for 'a Muslim state' at the Delhi Convention of the Muslim Legislators. The Muslim League became the organisation for almost every Indian Muslim when the independence came on 14 August 1947.\nNawab Salimullah was elected its president while Nawab Ali Chaudhury and Zahid Suhrawardy were elected secretaries. Barrister abdur rasul was elected as the treasurer and abul kashem as the joint secretary.

Notably, this only requires less than one percent of administered vaccines to be laced.\nThis is a deliberate \"squeeze\" to force the sheeple into mass vaccine suicide by making sure they cannot function in society (or receive government benefits) unless they go along with the vaccine mandates, which are of course a global extermination program disguised as a public health program. The mass extermination via vaccines consists of two strategies:\nThe next strain to be released via the vaccines will be COVID-21, and the COVID-21 strain could be rightly considered the second half of a binary weapon system that will achieve extremely high kill rates for human beings across the globe. Importantly, the mass die-offs will further justify government lockdowns, quarantines and medical authoritarianism that grants governments the power to forcefully inject people, kidnap people, imprison people and even exterminate people at will.\nThis, in turn, results in higher numbers of vaccine injections, which spread more weaponized viral strains, resulting in another wave of hysteria and so on. It's the perfect scam of tyranny and depopulation: The very governments who are building the bioweapons are using them to exterminate the masses while using the infections to justify their own power to administer the extermination weapons (i.e. vaccines).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-12-08\nTitle: How do vaccines work?\nContent:\nIn the 1980s, a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began. Over many years and several decades, polio vaccination, using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns, has taken place in all continents. Millions of people, mostly children, have been vaccinated and in August 2020, the African continent was certified wild poliovirus free, joining all other parts of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan, where polio has not yet been eradicated.\nThis article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series.\nVaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.\nSome vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Recombinant vaccines and the development of new vaccine strategies ...\nContent:\n<strong>Vaccines</strong> were initially developed on an empirical basis, relying mostly on attenuation or inactivation of pathogens.

It also mentions the release of COVID-21 via vaccines and its potential effects.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-12-08, explains how vaccines work, using polio vaccination as an example.

It did not go smoothly. - POLITICO\nContent:\nIt was April 2009 and the 3-month-old Obama administration was desperately grappling with the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression when homeland security adviser John Brennan arrived at the Oval Office to warn the president and Vice President Joe Biden of a new crisis: H1N1, the swine flu virus, was showing signs of rapid spread in Mexico, while cases were popping up in California and Texas. Brennan pointed out that the Spanish flu — the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history — was an H1N1 strain. “It made their eyebrows go up,” Brennan says now, recalling Biden’s reaction in particular.\nFrom that point forward, he basically took over on the swine flu deal.” · Biden laid out the potential dangers ahead, stressing the need to quickly ramp up on vaccine development, according to an aide in the room at the time. Democrats were receptive. Republican opposition had played a role in blocking the administration’s request for pandemic funding in the stimulus bill, before H1N1 even appeared. Now, with children vulnerable to infection, that opposition melted away.\nBut the day after his initial tweet, Trump amplified the claims, stating again on Twitter: “Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis.\nOur response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!” · Fact-checkers disputed Trump’s assertions, noting that the two polls measuring public approval of the Obama team’s response to H1N1 had averaged a fairly robust 67 percent.

Information 2 focuses on Vice President Biden's comments on the swine flu that drew criticism from the travel industry. Information 3, published during the 2020 presidential campaign, highlights President Trump's criticism of Joe Biden's handling of the H1N1 swine flu and compares it to his administration's response to COVID-19.

Information 5 is a PolitiFact article clarifying the number of deaths caused by H1N1 and correcting a misleading social media post.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that \"Biden did have a big problem with H1N1, which he says in reverse\" is misleading. While it is true that Joe Biden was Vice President during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, the claim implies that Biden either caused the problem or mishandled the response. However, the information provided does not support this claim. Instead, it suggests that the Trump administration has criticized the Obama administration's response to H1N1, but does not provide evidence that Biden himself was responsible for any mismanagement.\n\nMoreover, the claim that \"they didn't have the pandemic\" is also incorrect. The H1N1 swine flu was indeed a pandemic, as acknowledged by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2009. The WHO defines a pandemic as \"the worldwide spread of a new disease,\" which was certainly the case with H1N1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly false, as it misrepresents the role of Joe Biden during the H1N1 pandemic and incorrectly states that the H1N1 outbreak was not a pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

But researchers are also hard at work trying to understand, treat, and prevent the new coronavirus. We take a look at some of their results. ... Emerging evidence may offer a glimmer of hope with regards to the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, but we must interpret the results with caution.\nDoctors may be able to use an age-old method called “passive antibody therapy” to treat COVID-19, suggests research featuring in The Journal of Clinical Investigation. The researchers who authored the paper say, “Deployment of this option requires no research or development,” as the method has been around since the 1930s. The method involves collecting blood from a person who has had the virus and recovered from it. Using the serum — the part that contains infection-fighting antibodies — researchers hope to be able to inject another person, thus either preventing an infection or helping to fight it off.\nThe numbers are encouraging: In the first 6 weeks since the start of the outbreak, 413 healthcare workers dealt with 42 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of these employees, 11 had unprotected exposure to the new coronavirus.\nIn the trial, 45 healthy volunteers will receive a vaccine that contains a segment of genetic code copied from SARS-CoV-2. As the vaccine does not contain the actual SARS-CoV-2, the participants will not develop COVID-19.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Covid: Five reasons to be (cautiously) hopeful\nContent:\nThe past few months have been incredibly tough.

A study led by Dr. Leopoldo Segal found that patients with advanced-stage lung cancer had greater amounts of oral bacteria in their lungs compared to early-stage patients. This was associated with decreased survival, poor prognosis, and tumor progression. However, the study did not mention or allude to the impact of long-term mask-wearing or its relationship with lung cancer.\n2. An article from BlackListed News claimed that long-term mask use may contribute to advanced-stage lung cancer due to the inhalation of harmful microbes cultivated through prolonged mask-wearing. This article is from an independent news platform known to publish pseudoscience and conspiracy-related content.\n3. Several fact-checking articles, published between February 8 and February 17, 2021, debunk the claim that a study found long-term mask use may contribute to advanced-stage lung cancer. These articles confirm that masks are safe to wear and help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that long-term mask-wearing may cause advanced-stage lung cancer is false. Multiple fact-checking articles, published between February 8 and February 17, 2021, confirm that there is no evidence supporting this claim. The study in question did not involve mask-wearing and found no relationship between mask use and lung cancer. The claim originated from a known source of pseudoscience and conspiracy-related content.", "response": "FALSE."}

The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies by country.\nDifferences in the population size between countries are often large, and the COVID-19 death count in more populous countries tends to be higher. Because of this it can be insightful to know how the number of confirmed deaths in a country compares to the number of people who live there, especially when comparing across countries.\nIn this document, the many linked charts, our COVID-19 Data Explorer, and the Complete COVID-19 dataset, we report and visualize the data on confirmed cases and deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Despite all the news articles and reports, we know very little about the incidence or prevalence of this new disease. And as is always the case, ignorance breeds fear. In my hometown of New York City and elsewhere, one fear is on just about everyone’s mind: death rates here appear to be considerably higher than rates reported elsewhere.\nOr are they? Using patient data from China, public health officials initially estimated that 80% of COVID-19 cases are either asymptomatic or have mild disease. Given that hospital beds, health workers, and test kits are in short supply, only highly symptomatic people are advised to go to the hospital.\nShe calls her family doctor who makes a clinical diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 based on her symptoms, not a test.

By 31 December 2020, this figure stood at 1 813 188. Yet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nCountries also use different processes to test and report COVID-19 deaths, making comparisons difficult. To overcome these challenges, many countries have turned to excess mortality as a more accurate measure of the true impact of the pandemic.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-10-25\nTitle: The pandemic’s true death toll\nContent:\nIt accounts neither for variation between countries in the propensity of members of particular demographic groups to get infected, nor for differences in the prevalence of underlying medical conditions that increase vulnerability to covid-19. Because good medical treatment is harder to come by in poor countries, it overestimates the number of cases in such places.\nHow many people have died because of the covid-19 pandemic? The answer depends both on the data available, and on how you define “because”. Many people who die while infected with SARS-CoV-2 are never tested for it, and do not enter the official totals. Conversely, some people whose deaths have been attributed to covid-19 had other ailments that might have ended their lives on a similar timeframe anyway.\nConversely, some people whose deaths have been attributed to covid-19 had other ailments that might have ended their lives on a similar timeframe anyway.

Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus.\nResearchers aren't sure what caused it, and investigations as to its origin are ongoing. There's more than one type of coronavirus. They're common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS.\nThere are many factors, including the public's efforts to slow the spread, researchers' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines. ... The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.\nSome people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries. ...

Further, while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report, our internal guidelines emphasized early intubation and standard lung-protective ventilation strategies. Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual patient risk factors, clinical interventions and treatments, and health system factors that can improve mortality in the face of this global pandemic.\nThese data indicate that a majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can have good clinical outcomes and support the ongoing use of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure. In some of the earliest reports of COVID-19 from Wuhan, mortality rates among those admitted to ICUs ranged from 52–62%, and increased to 86–97% among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.5,6,15,16 In more recent data from the United Kingdom, 67% of those who had received mechanical ventilation died, as compared to 22% of patients intubated with viral pneumonia in the preceding three years.3 Early reports of smaller cohorts from Seattle, where some of the first COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in the United States, indicated that 50–67% of patients admitted to the ICU and 71–75% of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation died.1,2 A recently published report from New York also found high mortality of 88.1% among those who required mechanical ventilation.4\nDespite multiple reports of mortality rates exceeding 50% among critically ill adults with COVID-19, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, our early experience indicates that many patients survive their critical illness. COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is estimated that 15–20% of cases require hospitalization and 3–5% require critical care. While experience with COVID-19 continues to grow, reported mortality rates range from 50–97% in those requiring mechanical ventilation.1-6 These are significantly higher than the published mortality rates ranging from 35–46% for patients intubated with H1N1 influenza pneumonia and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).7-10\nThese high mortality rates have raised concerns as to whether invasive mechanical ventilation should be avoided in the context of COVID-19.11-14 To help address the growing concern that critical illness, and specifically mechanical ventilation, are associated with a high risk of death, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 across our academic health system. This is an observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to six COVID-designated intensive care units (ICUs) at three Emory Healthcare acute-care hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia from March 6, 2020 through April 17, 2020.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care (ICU) - Our World ...\nContent:\nAn interactive visualization from Our World in Data.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: ICU outcomes and survival in patients with severe COVID-19 in the ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 7 million of people around the world since December 2019 and in the United States has resulted so far in more than 100,000 deaths [1].

Since then, he has continued to insist the pandemic doesn’t exist in the country, Foreign Policy magazine reported.\nThe day before Magufuli’s January 27 remarks, leaders of the Catholic Church in Tanzania broke their silence and issued an alert about a surge in suspected COVID-19 cases. The secretary of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference told the BBC that there has been a rise in the number of funeral services in urban areas.\nBut in Tanzania, the president not only opposes vaccination, he denies the country has had COVID-19 cases. On January 27, President John Magufuli said, without evidence, that “vaccinations are dangerous.” He added that “if white people were able to come up with vaccinations, a vaccination for AIDS would have been found, a vaccination for tuberculosis could have eliminated it by now; a Malaria vaccine would have been found; a vaccination for cancer would have been found by now.”\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1:\n\n* A graphic on Facebook claims that Tanzanian president John Magufuli questioned the need for Covid-19 vaccines in Africa, as China had recovered from the pandemic without them.\n* Africa News reported that Tanzania had no plans to import Covid-19 vaccines and was conducting clinical trials on local herbs as a potential treatment.\n* However, there is no evidence that Magufuli publicly questioned the need for vaccines or claimed that China had recovered without them.\n* China is rolling out Covid-19 vaccines, with over 1 million vaccines administered by December 2020.\n\nInformation 2:\n\n* Tanzania recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 25, 2020, and formed a COVID-19 task force in response.\n* President Magufuli called for three days of national prayer and encouraged Tanzanians to rely on herbal remedies and steam inhalation to treat COVID-19 symptoms.\n* He declared Tanzania \"coronavirus free\" on June 8, 2020, and ceased all COVID-19 response programs.\n* Magufuli was skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and questioned their safety without evidence.\n* After Magufuli's passing, Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan took over and has implemented preventive measures and advocated for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nInformation 3:\n\n* Former Tanzanian president John Magufuli was declared dead on March 17, 2021.\n* Magufuli was controversial for denying the existence of Covid-19 in Tanzania.\n* A widely shared Facebook post claims that Magufuli would have known that there is no conclusive proof that Covid-19 exists.\n* Africa Check could not find evidence that Magufuli himself claimed that Koch's postulates had not been met for Covid-19.\n\nInformation 4:\n\n* Magufuli claimed that COVID-19 vaccines are \"dangerous\" and questioned their efficacy.\n* He urged Tanzanians to use domestic measures such as steam inhalation to treat COVID-19 symptoms.\n* Magufuli also raised doubts about the global push for developing COVID-19 vaccines.\n* The World Health Organization called on Tanzanian authorities to ramp up public health measures, such as wearing masks, to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5:\n\n* Magufuli insisted that Tanzania has been COVID-19 free and that vaccines are dangerous.\n* He dismissed the head of Tanzania's national laboratory and continued to deny the existence of COVID-19 cases in the country.\n* Leaders of the Catholic Church in Tanzania issued an alert about a surge in suspected COVID-19 cases.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that China didn't recover from Covid-19 without vaccines is true.

On the same day the Vatican confirmed four positive cases, Vatican employees in three different offices expressed alarm Tuesday that superiors had adopted different work-at-home policies that forced some to continue showing up. Concern about exposure risk has been heightened because many Vatican employees live in priests' residences or religious communities and eat together in communal dining rooms.\nFigures released by an Italian research institute yesterday showed that some 5,760 health workers had been infected with coronavirus. Nino Cartabellotta, the head of the Gimbe foundation which collected the data, urged that this 'phenomemon' must be 'curbed to safeguard those who take care of us'.

Additionally, a larger percentage of multi-racial and non-Hispanic adults of other races and ethnicities reported stress and worry about stigma or discrimination associated with being blamed for spreading COVID-19 in comparison to White adults. The CDC data, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, also noted that stigma, including harassment and discrimination, and social or structural determinants of health (e.g., inadequate access to safe housing, healthy food, transportation and health care) can increase the risk of chronic stress among people in racial and ethnic minority groups.\nThe CDC data, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, also noted that stigma, including harassment and discrimination, and social or structural determinants of health (e.g., inadequate access to safe housing, healthy food, transportation and health care) can increase the risk of chronic stress among people in racial and ethnic minority groups. In 2019, Black Americans reported not having enough food three times as frequently, and Hispanic Americans twice as frequently, as White Americans. COVID-19 has affected us all, but consequences of the pandemic have been distributed unevenly across demographic groups, highlighting existing, glaring inequities in our healthcare systems.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted us in a variety of ways – everything from our social lives to our mental health has been affected in one way or another. Reports of civil unrest have also been more prevalent in the media, and these images can be extremely stressful. The pandemic, coupled with the increase in civil unrest, can feel overwhelming for everyone, but it’s important to understand how communities of color are uniquely affected by these current events. Before we dive into the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in people of color, we want to paint a picture of where we are.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19: The Mental Health Impact on People of Color and Minority ...\nContent:\nRacial and ethnic minorities may be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal data suggest people from diverse backgrounds are more likely to be considered “essential workers,” which places them at higher risk for virus exposure. Reduced access to health care in this population may prevent them from getting the help they need, while higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder may raise their risk of mental health issues. Other factors that may impact the well-being of racial and ethnic minorities include discrimination, socioeconomic inequality, and language barriers.\nListening to the needs of minority populations and providing them with culturally competent mental health care is critical, said Margarita Alegría, chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital Disparities Research Unit. She recommended communities set up local crisis services and train community health workers to offer mental health and substance abuse treatment to people in their native language.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Emerging findings on the impact of COVID-19 on black and minority ...\nContent:\nBlack and minority ethnic groups tend to have poorer socioeconomic circumstances which lead to poorer health outcomes. In addition, the stress associated with being discriminated against based on race/ethnicity directly affects mental and physical health through physiological pathways. Studies of COVID-19 so far have suggested that people from black and minority ethnic communities are more likely to be exposed to the virus because they tend to live in more densely populated urban areas where the virus has spread fastest, and are more likely to be key workers, especially in London (Figure 2).\nThis article sets out some of the key points emerging from recent research on COVID-19 and health inequalities. It reviews the evidence that black and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk of catching and dying from the virus. It also considers the reasons why these groups are at greater risk.\nThere is clear evidence that black and minority ethnic groups are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than the rest of the population though that risk may not be the same for all ethnic groups. Data from the ONS published on 7 May show that, after adjusting for age, men and women of black ethnicity were at highest risk.\nA number of other studies have been done on COVID-19-related deaths occurring in hospital (eg Aldridge et al, the IFS, the OpenSAFELY Collaborative). These too have consistently found increased risk for some ethnic minority groups, particularly for people of black ethnicity and of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origins. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre also showed that 34% of COVID-19-related admissions to intensive care were for ethnic minority people, while they only account for 13% of the population of England and Wales.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BIPOC Communities and COVID-19 | Mental Health America\nContent:\nBlack Americans who are not essential workers are more likely to have lost their jobs because of COVID-19 than white people and other racial minorities. Economists call this a “first fired, last hired” phenomenon – Black people tend to lose work early on, and their unemployment rate continues to rise despite the employment market recovering for white workers[xi]. Nearly half (49 percent) of the Latinx population say they or someone in their household had to take a pay cut or lost their job (or both) due to COVID-19, compared to 33 percent of all US adults[xii].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color in America. Racial and ethnic disparities in health care are known factors contributing to the higher morbidity and mortality among people of color, as compared to white Americans. These disparities have a dual impact – not only are they resulting in differences in the actual care and treatment that COVID-19 patients receive, but they also put people in BIPOC communities at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 in the first place:\nThese disparities have a dual impact – not only are they resulting in differences in the actual care and treatment that COVID-19 patients receive, but they also put people in BIPOC communities at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 in the first place: Implicit Bias Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. While we all have biases, the impact of those on others depends on our social and professional roles in society. Biases held by health care workers when treating COVID-19 patients can determine things like who gets admitted into the hospital versus getting sent home to rest, who gets rushed into testing versus sitting around in the waiting room, and who is put on the next available ventilator.\nBiases held by health care workers when treating COVID-19 patients can determine things like who gets admitted into the hospital versus getting sent home to rest, who gets rushed into testing versus sitting around in the waiting room, and who is put on the next available ventilator.

However, in late 2019 and in the 2 years since, the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (referred to here as COVID-19) has seen millions of deaths globally, and with it many restrictions on visitors to those who are very ill in both hospitals and in aged care facilities (Burrell & Selman, 2020; Parks & Howard, 2021).\nThemes included the positives and negatives of virtual funeral attendance (e.g. opportunity to have a way to participate when travel barriers existed, versus a sense of impersonal voyeurism); and the challenges related to the inability to physically comfort the bereaved due to physical distancing requirements.

Then, on June 17, the Supreme Court stayed the high court’s order after the state government challenged it. As a result, the bodies of deceased patients who had shown symptoms of COVID-19 continue to go untested, the students at Osmania Hospital said.\nThe state’s director of medical education, Ramesh Reddy, wrote a letter in April to hospital medical superintendents admonishing them for testing dead bodies for the virus. Subsequently, on May 26, the Telangana high court reprimanded the state for trying to hide COVID-19 deaths and ordered the government to test all dead bodies.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: Telangana | Osmania General Hospital denies COVID-19 death rumours ...\nContent:\nDr. B.

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective. Figures from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland show that people admitted with covid-19 after 1 September were about 10 per cent less likely to die than those admitted before then. 16% Estimated coronavirus infection fatality rate for people over 90\nThe best way to work out how many people have been infected is to test the blood of thousands of people to see how many have antibodies to the coronavirus, and then extrapolate the results to entire countries.

A post claiming to be shared from a “whistleblower” says that residents of a care home died or became sick after receiving a heightened dose of the flu vaccine.\nThe copied message makes two claims: that multiple residents in a care home became sick or died within 48 hours of receiving a flu vaccine, and that the “dosage and potency” of the vaccine had been increased for elderly people. The post says: “I work in an elderly care home, and most of the 25 residents were vaccinated on Tuesday.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* A claim circulating on social media states that nearly 100 residents of a care home in Madrid died after getting a flu vaccine (Information 1).\n* Reuters fact-checking team has debunked this claim, stating that there is no evidence of 97 deaths in a Madrid care home in September and that the flu vaccination program only began in October (Information 1).\n* The flu vaccination campaign in Madrid starts in mid-October and targets the elderly and healthcare personnel first (Information 3).\n* Serious allergic reactions to the flu vaccine are very rare, and death is not listed as a potential adverse reaction (Information 5).\n* A similar claim was made in Spain in September and has been proven false (Information 5).\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that residents of a Madrid care home died due to a flu vaccine is false. The claim has been debunked by a reputable fact-checking team, and there is no evidence to support it. Furthermore, the flu vaccination campaign in Madrid starts in mid-October, and serious allergic reactions to the vaccine are very rare. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the flu vaccine caused any deaths in a Madrid care home in September.", "response": "FALSE."}

Tamaki responded by taking back his statement and expressed that he was misunderstood. Following a COVID-19 outbreak in the prefecture's US bases in 2020, Tamaki criticized the American military, expressing deep regret and doubt concerning the bases' ability to stop the spread of the virus, which at the time had already infected over 61 personnel. He cited possible sources of the outbreak, including off-base military parties on July 4, which had high risks of community spread.\nIn 2009, Tamaki called for a sharp reduction in American troop strength on Okinawa, stating that \"it's about time the Japanese government let Okinawa go back to its original self\" and \"we need to wean our economy from its dependence on the bases.\" This position was the major focus of his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, in which he argued against the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to another location on Okinawa, a position consistent with his late predecessor Onaga.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-06-28\nTitle: EDITORIAL | Why is Okinawa Governor Tamaki Against Protecting His ...\nContent:\nIn remembrance: Okinawa memorial day.

It is well-suited to developing tools to assist with the use of chest CT to diagnose COVID-19 (103). Advanced AI-based algorithms can learn the typical CT image signs, such as bilateral and subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGO), vascular thickening, spider web, and even crazy-paving patterns (104).\nDetails of the study selection process are shown in Figure 1.

In this scenario, São Paulo has the highest number of Brazilian cases (17 826), followed by Rio de Janeiro, which also has the highest mortality rate (9.1%), and Ceará third in the country in the number of cases [3, 4].\nThus, 131 deaths by COVID-19 were analysed in 24 854 people-days at risk. When evaluating the Kaplan–Meier survival function, 99.9% of survival probability in the 1st day, 95.1% in the 10th and 89.7% in the 20th was observed. From the 24th day of the disease course, the survival rate has been around 87.7% (Fig. 1).\nIRR, incidence rate ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. R2 = 34.09. ... Regarding survival analysis, it was considered the time since the beginning of symptoms until death/end of the survey (T2) as the study time variable. However, only 1363 out of 2070 confirmed cases had this record. Thus, 131 deaths by COVID-19 were analysed in 24 854 people-days at risk. When evaluating the Kaplan–Meier survival function, 99.9% of survival probability in the 1st day, 95.1% in the 10th and 89.7% in the 20th was observed.\nMortality was analysed by robust Poisson regression, and survival by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression. From the 2070 people that tested positive to COVID-19, 131 (6.3%) died and 1939 (93.7%) survived, the overall survival probability was 87.7% from the 24th day of infection.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-08-08, is an article by Poynter that discusses an Instagram post claiming the COVID-19 survival rate is over 99% for most age groups. The post is flagged as misinformation because it misuses CDC statistics for modeling pandemic scenarios instead of calculating the survival rate. The survival rate cannot be determined by looking at national statistics, as it doesn't account for individual risks and undercounted COVID-19 deaths.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-05-06, is a fact-check by USA Today that addresses a claim stating COVID-19 has a 98.5% survival rate. The claim is partially false, as the overall rate may be 1% or lower when factoring in undetected cases. However, definitive statements about the mortality rate are misleading, as individual risks vary.\n\nInformation 3 is a copy of Information 1, and Information 4, published without a date, is an AP News article discussing the misrepresentation of COVID-19 survival rates. The article clarifies that the survival rate for known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. is 98.2%, but the actual survival rate of all COVID-19 infections is higher due to undetected cases.\n\nInformation 5, published without a date, is a study on mortality and survival of COVID-19 in Brazil. The Kaplan-Meier survival function shows a 99.9% survival probability on the 1st day, 95.1% in the 10th day, 89.7% in the 20th day, and an overall survival probability of 87.7% from the 24th day of infection.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that the COVID-19 survival rate is over 99% is incorrect. The survival rate for known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. is around 98.2%, and the actual survival rate of all COVID-19 infections is higher due to undetected cases. The Kaplan-Meier survival function from the Brazilian study shows a 99.9% survival probability on the 1st day, 95.1% in the 10th day, 89.7% in the 20th day, and an overall survival probability of 87.7% from the 24th day of infection.

Eventually taken down by YouTube, but also republished through other video sharing sites, the video reached some 224 spaces with at least 2.8 million followers; Icke also released a further video, repeating claims that COVID-19 itself did not exist and that 5G was instead preventing human bodies from absorbing oxygen, thus causing COVID-like symptoms.\nSuch stories – which might be classified as state-sanctioned counter-propaganda – cover the use of 5G technology for telemedicine in Chinese hospitals, report on the deployment of 5G-controlled robots and drones to support doctors and patients and control the lockdown, or reaffirm the country’s commitment to the rollout of 5G technology in spite of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Our focus on Facebook and our search terms in Latin characters for this study necessarily mean that we are unlikely to capture any Chinese media content designed for domestic consumption in China – but from the data we do have it is clear that Chinese state media did embark on a concerted effort to present the benefits of 5G to a world audience, not least in countries where 5G conspiracy theories circulated widely.\nAlthough small themselves (with fewer than 500 followers in each case), they may have served as an entry point for this more violent aggression against 5G technology into the United Kingdom. A lengthy video, published on YouTube on 2 April by the notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke, claims that COVID-19 itself is a scam and is instead caused by 5G technology.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nFacebook says it’s significantly expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus. The company once simply flagged these posts as having been fact-checked, using third-party partners like Lead Stories and Full Fact. Now posts that include false claims about 5G and Covid-19 are being taken down, along with other false coronavirus-related content.\nA spokesperson told Recode that the platform is prioritizing taking down posts that include “a call to action that could potentially cause harm.” The company says that since March 18, it’s taken down more than 2,200 tweets violating its rules around Covid-19 content. There’s a chance this struggle to contain a dangerous conspiracy theory will endure. Part of what drove the 5G coronavirus conspiracy to the mainstream was a lack of good information about how the virus spreads and how it works, questions that scientists are still working to answer.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak.\nOthers float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis ...\nContent:\nIn the first week of January, some social media users pointed to 5G as being the cause of COVID-19 or accelerating its spread. The issue became a trending topic and appeared visible to all users on Twitter within the United Kingdom. Since then, multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking the two together. The conspiracy has been of such a serious nature that, in Birmingham and Merseyside, United Kingdom, 5G masts were torched over concerns associating this technology and the spread of the disease according to the British Broadcasting Corporation [9]. More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10]. This is unwelcome damage especially at a time when hospitals are required to operate with maximum efficiency.\nThe majority of influential users tweeting about 5G and COVID-19 consisted of members of the public sharing their views and opinions or news articles and videos supporting their cause. A key feature of the accounts was that they were actively engaged in sharing conspiracy theories; their bios included words such as “uncover” and “truth.”\nInterestingly, results show that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account (created on January 24, 2012), whose sole purpose was to raise awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G, and the account was named “5gcoronavirus19.” This account was in the group labeled “activism account” in Figure 1. The account creation date appears to be 2012, which suggests that a previously created account was converted, as Twitter allows users to change their user handle and username. The account has since been removed; however, the account bio description was “5G causes our immune system to lower and we become more susceptible to viruses.\nKeywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, twitter, misinformation, fake news, 5G, social network analysis, social media, public health, pandemic · The coronavirus strains have been known since 1960 and usually cause up to 15% of common colds in humans each year, mainly in mild forms.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Viral video claiming 5G caused pandemic easily debunked | CBC News\nContent:\nCowan claims that Wuhan, the location where the COVID-19 outbreak began, was the first city to be covered by 5G. He insists that this is proof that these two things are linked. However, cities in South Korea and the U.S. had 5G networks ... Also of note, Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network, alongside other countries like Japan and Malaysia, also hit hard by the pandemic.\nKindrachuk also said he has seen variations of the theory that 5G causes illness emerge long before the COVID-19 outbreak. \"It's actually been something that the anti-vax community has used fairly frequently as part of their argument against vaccination. So I'm not surprised.\nAccording to a review of public health records, the journal found that \"a combination of fresh air, sunlight, scrupulous standards of hygiene and reusable face masks appears to have substantially reduced deaths among some patients and infections among medical staff.\" ... Cowan claims that Wuhan, the location where the COVID-19 outbreak began, was the first city to be covered by 5G.\nAs proof that the cause of the global pandemic is not debris, Kindracuk points to various scientific investigations into the coronavirus, including the fact researchers have been able to take it apart physically and put the virus sequence back together and use it to infect primates. Prepare to see COVID-19 cases rising.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19, 5G conspiracies and infrastructural futures - PMC\nContent:\nThe main motivation for the protest was that 5G installation went ahead against council opposition, even though the installation was legal and did not require council authority (Bibby, 2020). Protesters blocked access to the site and had to be cleared by police (Bibby, 2020). Unlike celebrities’ social media posts mentioned earlier, no clear links were made to COVID-19. Indeed, ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020b, 2020c) criticised the media for making the link, arguing that ‘we were around long before CV!!’ However, the willingness to breach regulations and hold a large-scale gathering during a pandemic implied that they regarded the risks caused by 5G as of greater significance than coronavirus.\nWhile many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors. Perhaps surprisingly, Australia became something of a global hotspot for these actions, many of which appear to be coordinated (or at least actively supported) by ‘We say no to 5G in Australia’ (2020a) and other associated groups (e.g.\nThere are two types of conspiracy associated with 5G-COVID-19. One version suggests that radiation from 5G lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to the virus (Shultz, 2020). The idea that some exposure may weaken your general immunity would appear to share some similarities with the earlier claim that sustained exposure to EMF could cause cancer.\nThe second and more prominent conspiracy moves well away from these historical concerns with EMF exposure. Instead, it argues that 5G directly causes COVID-19. There are a number of variations around this conspiracy theory. Among the more notable of them are the erroneous claims that (a) COVID-19 is a made up pandemic to cover up the deleterious effects of 5G radiation (Asher Hamilton, 2020a) and (b) that COVID-19 emerged from Wuhan because it had ‘been the guinea-pig city for 5G’ (Adams, 2020).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides context for the claim by discussing the popularity of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology. The notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke is mentioned as having published a video claiming that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology, which reached millions of followers. Chinese state media is also mentioned as having embarked on a concerted effort to present the benefits of 5G technology to a world audience.\n\nInformation 2 discusses Facebook's efforts to combat conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, including the claim that 5G causes the virus. The article mentions that Facebook has expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus, including those that claim 5G and COVID-19 are related.\n\nInformation 3 provides a social network analysis of the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter. The analysis shows that the conspiracy theory became a trending topic in the UK and that multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking 5G and COVID-19. The analysis also shows that the fifth most influential account was a dedicated propaganda account named \"5gcoronavirus19,\" which was created in 2012 and had the sole purpose of raising awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G.\n\nInformation 4 debunks the claim that 5G caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The article mentions that cities in South Korea and the US had 5G networks before Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began. The article also mentions that Iran, one of the worst hotspots for COVID-19, does not have a 5G network.\n\nInformation 5 discusses the COVID-19, 5G conspiracies and infrastructural futures. The article mentions that while many activists questioned claims that 5G could spread COVID-19, there appeared to be a general disdain about the risks caused by the virus given that regular protests were held during a time when most countries were enforcing social distancing and telling people to stay indoors.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a video says COVID-19 is caused by 5G is true. Information 1 and 3 mention that David Icke, a notorious conspiracy theorist, published a video claiming that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology. Information 3 also mentions that a dedicated propaganda account named \"5gcoronavirus19\" was created in 2012 and had the sole purpose of raising awareness of the link between COVID-19 and 5G.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G technology.

Those challenging it include political parties, civil society and Muslim groups. But the protest was also criticised and most recently it was the target of a vitriolic state election campaign by the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Small amounts of aluminum are added to some vaccines to help the body build stronger immunity against the germ in the vaccine.\nOn July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in people 18 years and older as a primary 2-dose series vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. Novavax is available under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization. MF59 MF59 is the adjuvant contained in Fluad quadrivalent (an influenza vaccine licensed and recommended for adults aged 65 or older).\nAdjuvanted vaccines can cause more local reactions (such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and more systemic reactions (such as fever, chills and body aches) than non-adjuvanted vaccines. Aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum potassium sulfate have been used safely in vaccines for more than 70 years. Aluminum salts were initially used in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines after it was found they strengthened the body’s immune response to these vaccines.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: An Overview of Vaccine Adjuvants: Current Evidence and Future ...\nContent:\nAlthough studies have reported some potential side effects of vaccine adjuvants such as the recently recognised ASIA syndrome, the huge worth of vaccines remains unquestionable. Indeed, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccines, especially in regard to managing future potential pandemics.\nIndeed, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccines, especially in regard to managing future potential pandemics. In this field, research into adjuvants could play a leading role in the production of increasingly effective vaccines.\nIn fact, licensed RNA vaccines against COVID-19 have intrinsic adjuvant properties linked to the liposomal components used as carriers of codifying RNA. However, the newest licensed COVID-19 vaccine is based on a classical platform containing the spike protein and is adjuvanted with the addition of a new adjuvant named Matrix-M that contains fraction-A and fraction-C of Quillaja saponaria Molina extract [13].\nThe importance of vaccinations has been well-highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and further progress must be made by vaccine research in preparation for future pandemics. The efficacy of vaccines is based on the essential properties and contribution of adjuvants.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adjuvants for Coronavirus Vaccines - PMC\nContent:\nVaccine development utilizing various platforms is one of the strategies that has been proposed to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Adjuvants are critical components of both subunit and certain inactivated vaccines because they induce specific immune responses that are more robust and long-lasting.\nIn previously reported exploratory and pre-clinical CoV vaccine studies, adjuvants such as aluminum salts, emulsions, and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, have been used in vaccine formulations for studies with various animal models ( Table 1 ). The adjuvants AS03, MF59, and CpG 1018 have already been used in licensed vaccines (28) and have been committed by GlaxoSmithKline, Seqirus, and Dynavax to be available for COVID-19 vaccine development (29). When combined with subunit and specific inactivated antigens (30, 31), adjuvants with various characteristics elicit distinctive immunological profiles with regard to the direction, duration, and strength of immune responses. Thus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32).\nThus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32). Among these adjuvants, alum have been formulated with S protein or RBD to induce neutralizing antibody production (17, 18), which has suggested to be associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 (15, 16, 24).\nOther adjuvants, e.g., emulsion adjuvants and TLR agonists, which have been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses could be more favorable. However, no phase III clinical trial results of COVID-19 vaccines are published so far, thus, there is no direct evidence to indicate which type of immune response induced by vaccine plays a more critical protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How a new vaccine adjuvant might help to shorten race to COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nDifferent adjuvants also trigger different sensing pathways in our immune system.

Does that not solve the problem for vaccines against the novel coronavirus?\nBecause if you have an existing vaccine that already has an adjuvant that may be active, but perhaps weak, if you combine it with a bisphosphonate, you would expect to see synergistic activity. In fact, we tried bisphosphonate in combination with readily available vaccines, and we saw, indeed, that there was an amplification of the antibody immune response to those vaccines. What we are now trying to explore in animal models is, could we basically use bisphosphonate to turbocharge whatever COVID-19 vaccines may come online, hopefully within a year or so.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adjuvants for COVID-19 Vaccines - PMC\nContent:\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination focused on mRNA-type and viral vector vaccines. However, during the years 2022 and 2023, the first protein-based vaccines began to be approved.

However, none of the provided information supports this claim. The information about Ebola and COVID-19 vaccines does not mention any cases where a vaccinated individual contracted Ebola or experienced Ebola-like symptoms.\n\nGiven the lack of supporting evidence and the absence of any connection between the provided information and the claim, it is highly unlikely that the claim is true. Additionally, Ebola and COVID-19 are caused by different viruses, and there is no evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of contracting Ebola. Therefore, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Very recently, some African countries have reportedly claimed that the anecdotal use of an extract of A. annua is efficacious for COVID-19 management, albeit with no scientific evidence demonstrated. In ethnobotanical practice, the whole plant is commonly used for treating malaria, cough, and cold (Nigam et al.\nScientific articles and reports on Artemisia and Artemisia-based products for the management of SARS-CoV-2 were carefully accessed from online databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Researchgate COVID-19, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Web of Science and other scientific databases on COVID-19 such as WHO situation reports on COVID, US National Library of Medicine and Chinese clinical trial registry were also accessed using the keywords; Artemisia, Artemi, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.\nHerbal medicine is predominantly utilized in countries like China, India, Egypt and many others on the African continent for the treatment of several (mild and severe) ailments and infectious diseases, including coronavirus infections (Jin et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiological agent of COVID-19 (WHO 2020c).\nThese permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The search for a potent anti-coronavirus therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains an overwhelming task since the outbreak of COVID-19. It is more evident that most of the existing antiviral and immune-boosting drugs are non-promising and ineffective for the treatment of coronavirus infected patients while the safety of a few drugs/vaccines that have demonstrated high potential remains unclear.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Artemisia Extracts and Artemisinin-Based Antimalarials for COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nIn South Africa, teas of Artemisia afra were used without in vitro or clinical data [96]. A. afra, in contrast to A. annua, does not contain artemisinin. Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19 [97], the WHO recently called for investigations into the efficacy of plant-based traditional medicines [98]. Human clinical trials will be required to answer the question whether the traditional medicines may indeed have an effect in either preventing or treating COVID-19 infections.\nThe Artemisia species, such as A. annua and A. afra, in particular, exhibit positive effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 related symptoms. A. annua is a source of artemisinin, which is active against malaria, and also exhibits potential for other diseases. This has increased interest in artemisinin’s potential for drug repurposing. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, so-called ACTs, have already been recognized as first-line treatments against malaria. Artemisia extract, as well as ACTs, have demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.\nArtemisinin-based combination therapies, so-called ACTs, have already been recognized as first-line treatments against malaria. Artemisia extract, as well as ACTs, have demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Artemisinin and its derivatives have also shown anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a key role in the development of severe COVID-19.\nDespite vaccine developments, COVID-19 treatment still remains largely supportive with an urgent need to identify effective anticoronavirals. An attractive approach is repurposing drugs already licensed for other diseases. In this respect, several studies have been undertaken to test whether antimalarial drugs could treat COVID-19. Teas of Artemisia annua L. plants have been employed to treat malaria [14,15,16] in many African countries.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-09\nTitle: Coronavirus: What do we know about the artemisia plant?\nContent:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is to test a malaria drug on Covid patients, which is derived from the artemisia plant used in Madagascar. The African island nation attracted a lot of attention last year when it announced it was promoting a drink containing artemisia plant extracts to combat coronavirus. There's no evidence so far that this plant can combat Covid-19.\nAnd scientists in South Africa have been doing laboratory tests on artemisia annua and another variety of the plant - artemisia afra - for effectiveness against Covid-19. The active ingredient found in the dried leaves of artemisia annua is called artemisinin, and it does work against malaria. Chinese scientists pioneered the discovery of its properties when they were searching for a cure for malaria in the 1970s. Chinese scientists on the search for a malaria cure · Artemisinin-based combination therapies - known for short as ACTs - are recommended by the WHO against malaria, especially those types now resistant to chloroquine, which is one of the main drug treatments for the disease.\nIt's a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant, used for decades to treat malaria. The drug will be part of an on-going trial involving researchers in hospitals around the world, looking at treatments for the most seriously ill Covid patients. Four other drugs that were part of an earlier phase of this trial were found to have little or no effect on hospitalised patients. The WHO says there is currently no evidence that artemisia-derived products are effective in treating Covid-19.\nThere's no evidence so far that this plant can combat Covid-19. Artesunate is one of three new drugs to be tested on hospitalised Covid patients. It's a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant, used for decades to treat malaria.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: In vitro efficacy of Artemisia extracts against SARS-CoV-2 | Virology ...\nContent:\nThe clinical benefits of Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug approved for treatment of COVID-19, are being discussed controversially [7], such that COVID-19 treatment remains largely supportive. Repurposing of drugs already licensed for other diseases is a comparatively fast method to meet the urgent need for effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Artesunate 2 and other synthetic derivatives of the sesquiterpene lactone natural product artemisinin 1 (Fig. 1) that is isolated from Artemisia annua plants, are the key active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of WHO-recommended anti-malaria combination therapies, used in millions of patients every year with few side effects [8]. Teas made from the leaves of A. annua plants are recommended in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat malaria [9] and teas from Artemisia plants are widely used in many African countries to treat malaria patients, albeit contrary to WHO recommendations [10].\nIn South Africa, teas of A. afra that—in contrast to A. annua—do not contain artemisinin 1, were used widely without in vitro or clinical data [19]. In Madagascar, Covid-Organics, a drink containing mainly A. annua extract and/or plant material, was announced by the President of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina as a “miracle cure” in April 2020, subsequently used in the country and exported to several African nations in hope to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections [20]. Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19, the WHO issued a warning against the use of traditional medicines [21]. More recently, the WHO modified its recommendation and called for an investigation into the potential efficacy of plant-based treatments [22]. To date, no in vitro data concerning anti-viral effects of A. afra plant extracts or Covid-Organics has been disclosed.\nHuman phase 2 clinical trials are currently ongoing to test the efficacy of these substances in treating COVID-19 [18]. Other groups reported similar findings concerning pure synthetic artemisinin derivatives [25] and whole A. annua plant material [17]. Reports that teas made from A. annua and A. afra plants [19], as well as Covid-Organics, a drink made from A. annua leaves and Ravensara aromatica in Madagascar [20], have been used throughout Africa.\nBackground Traditional medicines based on herbal extracts have been proposed as affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Teas and drinks containing extracts of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra have been widely used in Africa in efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and fight COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 16, 2020, states that WHO did not officially recognize artemisia as a treatment for COVID-19, but acknowledged Madagascar's promotion of artemisia-based drinks as a treatment. However, WHO made it clear that scientific evidence is needed for it to be deemed a reliable cure.\n\nInformation 2, although the publication date is not specified, provides a comprehensive review of scientific articles and reports on Artemisia and Artemisia-based products for the management of SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the potential of Artemisia and its derivatives as a potential therapeutic drug for COVID-19, but also notes the lack of scientific evidence to support the anecdotal use of Artemisia extract for COVID-19 management in African countries.\n\nInformation 3, also without a specific publication date, discusses the positive effects of Artemisia species, such as A. annua and A. afra, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related symptoms. It also highlights the potential of artemisinin and its derivatives for drug repurposing and their anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a key role in the development of severe COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 9, 2020, states that the WHO is to test a malaria drug derived from the artemisia plant on COVID-19 patients. The drug, artesunate, is a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant and has been used for decades to treat malaria. However, the WHO emphasizes that there is currently no evidence that artemisia-derived products are effective in treating COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, without a specific publication date, provides in vitro data on the efficacy of Artemisia extracts against SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the potential of artemisinin derivatives as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn summary, while there is ongoing research and some evidence to suggest the potential of Artemisia and its derivatives as a treatment for COVID-19, there is currently no official recognition by WHO of artemisia as a treatment for COVID-19.

However, the results have been inconsistent and so the connection between COVID-19 and different blood types still isn't clear. One study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April of 2021, reviewed nearly 108,000 COVID-19 cases. Researchers found no link between blood type and COVID-19 risk, adding that more research was needed on the topic.\nRegardless of if a specific blood type is associated with a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe disease, keep in mind that many other factors, such as age or existing health conditions, are likely to play a larger, dominant role in determining personal risk from COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists risk factors that have been identified for developing severe COVID-19, and blood type does not appear.\nQuite a bit of research has been published about blood type and COVID-19 risk.

That’s because blood type is one of many factors that influences the risk of COVID-19 infection, as well as the risk of developing severe complications. While some studies have documented that type A is linked to a 48% increased risk of dying from COVID-19, not everyone with type A blood has the same amount of A group antigens among their cells.\nWhile some studies have documented that type A is linked to a 48% increased risk of dying from COVID-19, not everyone with type A blood has the same amount of A group antigens among their cells. People also have varying levels of ACE2 receptors on their cells, so even those with type A blood may not necessarily be at higher risk of getting infected compared to people with type O blood.\nType O is essentially a clean slate when it comes to blood type proteins, so it can serve as a universal donor and be transfused to people with type A, B or AB and not trigger an immune response. Types A, B and AB, however, each contain different groups of proteins, or antigens, which, as Stowell learned, makes them interact differently with the COVID-19 virus. ... In the studies, type A was linked to anywhere from a 25% to 50% increased risk of infection, depending on the particular variant involved.\nThe connection is important because the virus uses those projections, or proteins, as the entryway to bind to and then infect human cells. If the virus recognizes the blood group proteins, then that might mean certain blood groups could enhance the viruses’ ability to infect cells. That would provide an explanation for how blood type might play a role in COVID-19 risk.\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies investigating risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The review found that four out of five studies showed significant associations with Rh-negative blood grouping, with Rh-negative subjects at lower risk of viral infection, severe illness, and mortality after infection. However, the impact on COVID-19-related illness or mortality was not found.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2023, discusses new research explaining the link between type A blood and a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While public health measures over the last decade have led to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in the USA from ~20 to ~14%, a new and similarly detrimental risk factor has emerged during this same time-period, namely electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes or vaping.\nA recent study demonstrated a strong association between vaping and an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection [93]. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is expressed on respiratory epithelium has been shown to be an effective site for host entry of the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus that causes COVID-19 infection [94]. ACE2 expression has been shown to be elevated among individuals who smoke and is similarly hypothesized to be elevated those who use nicotine-containing e-cigarettes [95]. High concentrations of ACE2 receptors are found on the lung epithelium, resulting in increased absorption of COVID-19 particles within the small airways. In addition, like smoking, vaping triggers oxidative stress and decreases the body’s ability to initiate disease inflammatory responses in the lungs, increasing the risk of bacterial and viral infections.\nSpecial consideration needs to be paid to the association between youth who smoke or use e-cigarettes and COVID-19. A recently reported national population-based on-line survey of adolescents and young adults (n=4,351) 13-24 years of age demonstrated significant public health concerns indicating vaping is a risk factor of COVID-19 infection [93]. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between COVID 19-symptoms, testing, diagnosis, cigarette use, e-cigarette use, and dual cigarette use, socioeconomic factors and compliance with sheltering in place.\nIn addition, like smoking, vaping triggers oxidative stress and decreases the body’s ability to initiate disease inflammatory responses in the lungs, increasing the risk of bacterial and viral infections. Oxidative stress damages the epithelial membrane increasing cell permeability resulting in decreased ability to clear secretions, thus increasing susceptibility to respiratory compromise [96]. Special consideration needs to be paid to the association between youth who smoke or use e-cigarettes and COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Smoking, vaping linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nHowever, the robust and significant increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 seen in our study, independent of medical history and medication use and particularly among young individuals, underscores the urgent need for extensive public health interventions such as anti-smoking campaigns and increased access to cessation therapy, especially in the age of COVID,” said the study’s senior author, Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. “These findings provide the clearest evidence to date that people who smoke or vape have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and dying as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”\nDALLAS, July 26, 2022 — People who reported smoking or vaping prior to their hospitalization for COVID-19 were more likely than their counterparts who did not smoke or vape to experience severe complications, including death, from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings are from a new study based on data from the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 CVD Registry and published in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed, open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science.\n“In general, people who smoke or vape tend to have a higher prevalence of other health conditions and risk factors that could play a role in how they are impacted by COVID-19. However, the robust and significant increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 seen in our study, independent of medical history and medication use and particularly among young individuals, underscores the urgent need for extensive public health interventions such as anti-smoking campaigns and increased access to cessation therapy, especially in the age of COVID,” said the study’s senior author, Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.\nThe study findings indicate smoking or vaping are associated with more severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, race or medical history: People who reported smoking were 45% more likely to die and 39% more likely to receive mechanical ventilation when compared with those who did not smoke. Although the excessive risk due to smoking was independent of medical history and medication use, smoking was a stronger risk factor for death in people between 18-59 years of age and those who were white or had obesity.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-04-21\nTitle: Smoking, vaping linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nHowever, the robust and significant increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 seen in our study, independent of medical history and medication use and particularly among young individuals, underscores the urgent need for extensive public health interventions such as anti-smoking campaigns and increased access to cessation therapy, especially in the age of COVID,\" said the study's senior author, Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. \"These findings provide the clearest evidence to date that people who smoke or vape have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and dying as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\"\nStrokes, Rose Marie Robertson, Aruni Bhatnagar.

However, heterogeneity was still high. Referring to combined combustible cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use, we performed subgroup analysis of total ORs. Compared to neither e-cigarette nor combustible cigarette users, pooled OR of stroke occurrence in current e-cigarette only users was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99–1.29) (I2=45.9%, p=0.116). Compared to combustible cigarette only smokers, pooled OR of stroke occurrence in dual e-cigarette and combustible cigarette users was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.19–1.64) (I2=5.6%, p=0.303).\nCompared to combustible cigarette only smokers, pooled OR of stroke occurrence in dual e-cigarette and combustible cigarette users was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.19–1.64) (I2=5.6%, p=0.303). In addition, pooled OR in currently e-cigarette only users who were formerly combustible cigarette only smokers was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.22–2.07) (I2=0.0%, p=0.989). Compared to neither e-cigarette nor combustible cigarette users, pooled OR of stroke occurrence in e-cigarette users who did not clearly distinguish the use of combustible cigarettes was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.79–1.13) and pooled OR in both e-cigarette and combustible cigarette users was 1.95 (95% CI: 1.06–3.61) with a heterogeneity of I2=87.1% (p<0.001) and I2=98.1% (p<0.001) (Figure 4).\n\nInformation 1, published on July 24, 2020, discusses the increased stroke risk for COVID-19 patients who smoke or vape. It explains how vaping can harm blood vessels in the brain and affect the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, long-term vaping may increase the risk of stroke, and vaping may make individuals more vulnerable to COVID-19 by increasing ACE2 receptors. The combination of COVID-19 and smoking or vaping increases the risk of stroke due to increased blood clotting factors.\n\nInformation 2, although it does not have a specific publication date, provides further context on the relationship between stroke, smoking, and vaping. It highlights that cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for stroke, and electronic cigarettes have emerged as a similarly detrimental risk factor. Vaping triggers oxidative stress and decreases the body's ability to initiate disease inflammatory responses in the lungs, increasing the risk of bacterial and viral infections.\n\nInformation 3, also without a specific publication date, supports the claim by discussing a study that found people who smoke or vape prior to their hospitalization for COVID-19 were more likely to experience severe complications, including death, from the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nInformation 4, published on April 21, 2023, refers to the same study as Information 3, emphasizing the increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death for people who smoke or vape.\n\nInformation 5 does not have a specific publication date, but it discusses a systematic review of electronic cigarette use as a risk factor for stroke. The pooled OR of stroke occurrence in current e-cigarette only users is 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99--1.29), indicating a slightly increased risk. Compared to combustible cigarette only smokers, pooled OR of stroke occurrence in dual e-cigarette and combustible cigarette users is 1.39 (95% CI: 1.19--1.64), suggesting a higher risk for dual users.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that stroke risk is higher for COVID-19 patients who smoke or vape is supported by multiple sources. The increased risk is due to the effects of smoking and vaping on blood vessels, the blood-brain barrier, and the body's inflammatory responses. Additionally, the combination of COVID-19 and smoking or vaping further increases the risk of stroke.", "response": "TRUE."}

Many of the projects are part of or aligned with the COVID Human Genetic Effort (COVID HGE), an international consortium of scientists in more than 150 countries who are conducting myriad projects to look for genetic factors for immunity to infection, as well as the absence of symptoms after infection. The consortium has drawn applications from more than 15,000 people, and reports more than 700 enrolled so far.\nThat points to a conundrum facing the studies of genetics and COVID-19: Many confounding factors can contribute to the absence of disease symptoms in people who were significantly exposed. These include their overall health, how much of the virus was shed by COVID-stricken people around them, and the strength of their immune systems.\nIf genetic variations can make people immune or resistant to COVID-19, it remains to be seen how that knowledge can be used to create population-level protection. After all, while the discovery nearly three decades ago that some people have genetic immunity to HIV helped scientists develop post-infection treatments, there is still no vaccine to prevent infection.\nSuch an approach, however, would probably be used only for people at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, such as people with cancer or immune disorders. Sanjana points out that genes exist to serve critical functions, and disabling any of those functions creates risks for unintended harmful consequences. The more likely route, he and other researchers say, is using genetic findings to develop treatments for people after they’re infected, as happened with AIDS. “Genetics can enable us to dichotomize the population into who’s more likely [to develop a severe case of COVID-19] and who’s not,” says Beckmann at ISMMS.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: One Size Doesn’t Fit All: COVID-19 Vaccines and Immunocompromised ...\nContent:\nFor many immunocompromised patients, the regular two-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen—and in some cases, even a third dose—didn't provide sufficient immune protection.

When researchers reviewed 16 studies of people who stayed physically active during the pandemic, they found that working out was associated with a lower risk of infection as well as a lower likelihood of severe Covid-19.\nWidespread inflammation can be extremely damaging, even turning your own immune cells against your body. It is a known risk factor for Covid-19, Dr. Nieman said. Therefore, it makes sense that reducing inflammation could improve your chances of fighting off infection, he said. Research also shows that exercise may amplify the benefits of some vaccines. People who worked out right after getting their Covid-19 vaccine, for example, seemed to produce more antibodies.\nThis folk wisdom has been around for ages, but until recently, researchers did not have much data to support the idea.

Early data from very small numbers of COVID-19 patients in China show some promise.\nSo doctors, scientists, blood banks, and government agencies have begun mobilizing to collect, distribute, and study plasma from COVID-19 survivors. The advantage of plasma is that you don’t need to develop a vaccine or treatment from scratch.

This can make it difficult for kids with food allergies to enjoy holiday meals.\nThis can make it difficult for kids with food allergies to enjoy holiday meals. Even a trace amount of an allergen could cause a child to go into anaphylaxis – a potentially life-threatening reaction. That is why it is important for parents of children with food allergies to be extra cautious around the holidays.\nFor children with EoE that are following an elimination diet, avoiding their allergens can be just as important as those who are at risk for anaphylaxis. Sticking to strict elimination and not taking chances on meals and treats that may contain their allergen is an important step in following their care plan for the treatment of EoE.\nYour child's teacher may be willing to provide a special menu or dish for the class party.

When I was working in the emergency department, I was told [anaphylaxis] was higher on Halloween,\" said study co-author Dr. Moshe Ben-Shoshan, an associate professor of allergy and immunology at Montreal Children's Hospital and McGill University in Canada. \"With this study, we wanted to establish whether there actually was an increased risk of anaphylaxis on holidays compared to the rest of the year.\"\nAnd the risk is similar on Easter -- when kids are hopping around collecting chocolate eggs and other candy. Compared to other times, anaphylaxis from unknown nut exposure spiked 70% at Easter and there was a 60% increase in peanut-triggered anaphylaxis. Fortunately, other holidays -- including Christmas, Chinese New Year, Diwali and Eid al-Adha -- didn't seem to lead to an increase in serious reactions in kids with food allergies.\nWhile Halloween and Easter may look different this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ben-Shoshan said parents need to stay extra vigilant on these holidays to make sure their kids with allergies stay safe. ... The researchers can't know for sure from the study data, but these tend to be holidays where children are given candy. And, in the case of Halloween, it often comes from people who don't know them (or about their allergies) at all. \"Vigilance is important. Have the epinephrine pen nearby and supervise your child. The risk was higher in kids 6 years and above -- don't think that an 8-year-old will always be responsible.\nThere should always be an epinephrine pen nearby.\" Both experts mentioned that on Halloween kids with food allergies can look for homes with teal-colored pumpkins on their doorstep.

This involved walking downhill towards Martin Luther King Avenue and then back uphill again to the top of a ridge in the Madrona neighborhood. I was rewarded with lovely views of Lake Washington. It was another gorgeous spring day and a few people were out but it was easy to maintain a generous social distance. In total I walked 1.8 miles with 173 feet of elevation gain.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Something Wicked This Way Comes: A Novel by Ray Bradbury, Paperback ...\nContent:\nOne of Ray Bradbury’s best-known and most popular novels, <strong>Something</strong> <strong>Wicked</strong> <strong>This</strong> <strong>Way</strong> <strong>Comes</strong>, now featuring a new introduction and material about its longstanding influence on culture and genre.For those who still dream and remember, for those yet to experience the...\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: COMMENTARY: COVID-Positive: A Physician's Diary - WebMD\nContent:\nStrokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19.

[5, 6] On February 11, 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses issued a statement announcing an official designation for the novel virus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nAdhikari and colleagues published a cohort study evaluating 252 pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Texas. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 95% of them, and 3% developed severe or critical illness. Compared with COVID negative pregnancies, there was no difference in the composite primary outcome of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate. Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in six of 188 tested infants,(3%) primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mothers.\nA study by Chambers and colleagues found human milk is unlikely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 from infected mothers to infants. The study included 64 milk samples provided by 18 mothers infected with COVID-19. Samples were collected before and after COVID-19 diagnosis. No replication-competent virus was detectable in any of their milk samples compared with samples of human milk that were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nThe CDC surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants includes US COVID-19 cases caused by variants. The site also includes which mutations are associated with particular variants. The CDC has launched a genomic surveillance dashboard and a website tracking US COVID-19 case trends caused by variants. Researchers are studying how variants may or may not alter the extent of protection by available vaccines.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: The most important research questions - PMC\nContent:\nAlthough diarrhea was rarely seen in studies with large cohorts [6, 7], the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via sewage, waste, contaminated water, air condition system and aerosols cannot be underestimated, particularly in cases such as the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 people, among whom at least 742 have been confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 plausibly as the result of a superspreading event. Further investigations are required to determine the role of fecal–oral transmission in these cases and within the representative residential areas selected for detailed epidemiological studies in Wuhan as discussed earlier. The fifth question concerns how COVID-19 should be diagnosed and what diagnostic reagents should be made available. RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples provides the only specific diagnostic test at the initial phase of the outbreak.\nA pioneering study conducted in the city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong by a group of clinicians and scientists from the University of Hong Kong has provided the first concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [1]. This is an excellent example of how a high-quality clinical study can make a major difference in policy setting.

Preliminary results showed that chloroquine phosphate had apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 73. However, caution must be taken during clinical use of chloroquine as its overdose is highly fatal without known antidote 74.

He also highlighted the fact that vaccines they tested in the 2012 study did not use mRNA technology like some of the Covid-19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and were in fact “very different vaccine platforms”.\nAgain, this vaccine was not created to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is not based on the mRNA technology that underpins vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\nThere is no evidence for this.. The claim is based on a 2012 study looking at different vaccines. The animals, in this case mice, were euthanized as is standard procedure in this sort of trial. They did not die “months later” as claimed.\nThe study this particular claim is based on was about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and published in 2012. It did not focus on Covid-19 vaccines, or even use the same technology that underpins the vaccines currently being used against Covid-19. And even in this study, the animals were euthanized—they did not die in the ways described in the post.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology | Nature Reviews Drug ...\nContent:\nRecent technological advances have now largely overcome these issues, and multiple mRNA vaccine platforms against infectious diseases and several types of cancer have demonstrated encouraging results in both animal models and humans. This Review provides a detailed overview of mRNA vaccines and considers future directions and challenges in advancing this promising vaccine platform to widespread therapeutic use. ... Vaccines prevent many millions of illnesses and save numerous lives every year1. As a result of widespread vaccine use, the smallpox virus has been completely eradicated and the incidence of polio, measles and other childhood diseases has been drastically reduced around the world2.\nIn this case, the antigen is expressed from a naked, unmodified, sequence-optimized mRNA, while the adjuvant activity is provided by co-delivered RNA complexed with protamine (a polycationic peptide), which acts via TLR7 signalling52,54. This vaccine format has elicited favourable immune responses in multiple preclinical animal studies for vaccination against cancer and infectious diseases18,36,55,56.\nPreclinical studies have created hope that mRNA vaccines will fulfil many aspects of an ideal clinical vaccine: they have shown a favourable safety profile in animals, are versatile and rapid to design for emerging infectious diseases, and are amenable to scalable good manufacturing practice (GMP) production (already under way by several companies). Unlike protein immunization, several formats of mRNA vaccines induce strong CD8+ T cell responses, likely owing to the efficient presentation of endogenously produced antigens on MHC class I molecules, in addition to potent CD4+ T cell responses56,87,88.\nAs a result, mRNA vaccines have elicited protective immunity against a variety of infectious agents in animal models19,20,22,56,89,90 and have therefore generated substantial optimism. However, recently published results from two clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases were somewhat modest, leading to more cautious expectations about the translation of preclinical success to the clinic22,91 (discussed further below).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman ...\nContent:\nNonhuman primates received 10 or 100 μg of mRNA-1273, a vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, or no vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens.\nThe mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-μg dose group and 3481 in the 100-μg dose group. Vaccination induced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)–biased CD4 T-cell responses and low or undetectable Th2 or CD8 T-cell responses.\nVaccination of nonhuman primates with mRNA-1273 induced robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, rapid protection in the upper and lower airways, and no pathologic changes in the lung. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)\nThe use of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a promising approach for Covid-19 vaccination, since it combines rapid manufacturing and expeditious modification of the encoded immunogen, both of which accelerate vaccine development.14 RNA vaccines encoding viral antigens have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in several clinical trials,5,15 including in a recent phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1273, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.16 Data from a mouse model showing that a low dose of mRNA-1273 induced a robust neutralizing antibody response and high-level protection against SARS-CoV-26 raised the possibility that vaccination with mRNA-1273 could prevent or limit both upper- and lower-airway infection in nonhuman primates.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-05-20\nTitle: Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine makers did not halt animal tests, ...\nContent:\nAlison Fennell, May 19, email exchange with USA TODAY · New England Journal of Medicine, Oct. 15, 2020, Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates\nPfizer, Sept. 9, 2020, PFIZER AND BIONTECH ANNOUNCE DATA FROM PRECLINICAL STUDIES OF MRNA-BASED VACCINE CANDIDATE AGAINST COVID-19\nModerna, May 18, Moderna Announces Positive Interim Phase 1 Data for its mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1273) Against Novel Coronavirus\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-02, is a fact-check article by Reuters stating that a 2012 study did not use mRNA vaccines and the animals did not die from disease when exposed to a live virus.

How BAME women navigate maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a vigilant review of their needs on an individual basis. This is particularly relevant for hard-to-reach women, such as recent immigrants and asylum seekers, who may encounter difficulties accessing or engaging with maternity services. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess and highlight the challenges faced by pregnant BAME women during the pandemic.\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women in the UK have increased maternal mortality rates compared to other groups of women. Unfortunately, according to preliminary findings, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to mortality rates for BAME women, raising concerns that pregnant BAME women are facing greater health disparities during the pandemic. A review of 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital in the UK with confirmed COVID-19 infection found that over half (56%) were from black or other ethnic minority groups.\nAbuelgasim E, Saw LJ, Shirke M, Zeinah M, Harky A.

Long standing inequities in the social determinants of health, such as occupation and housing circumstances that make physical distancing challenging, have put some racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk for COVID-19–associated illness and death (4,5). Better understanding of the circumstances under which Hispanic and Black women of reproductive age are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 could inform prevention strategies.\nLong standing inequities in the social determinants of health, such as occupation and housing circumstances that make physical distancing challenging, have put some racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk for COVID-19–associated illness and death (4,5). Better understanding of the circumstances under which Hispanic and Black women of reproductive age are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 could inform prevention strategies. Most pregnant women with COVID-19 in this study were asymptomatic, similar to findings in settings where universal SARS-CoV-2 testing is conducted upon admission to labor and delivery units (6).\nDuring March 1–August 22, 2020, COVID-NET identified 7,895 hospitalized women aged 15–49 years with COVID-19; discharge disposition was determined, and chart review was completed for 2,318 (29.4%) (Figure 1). Among 2,255 (97.3%) women with information about pregnancy status, 598 (26.5%) were pregnant, with median age 29 years. Among 577 (96.5%) pregnant women with reported race and ethnicity, 42.5% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and 26.5% were non-Hispanic Black (Black) (Table). Among 596 women with COVID-19 whose pregnancy trimester was known, 14 (2.3%), 61 (10.2%), and 521 (87.4%) were hospitalized during the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-06-09, is a preprint study from the University of Oxford and multiple other institutions in the UK. The study analyzed data from 427 pregnant women admitted to hospitals after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and April 14, 2020.

Aleisha FettersMay 1, 2023 · Just one daily serving of drinks like soda, sweet tea, and fruit juice may raise the risk of early death for people with type 2 diabetes.By Becky UphamApril 25, 2023\nFor people with type 2 diabetes, the motto “everything in moderation” may not be the best advice, at least when it comes to drinking alcohol. A study published on September 9 in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that drinking only eight alcoholic beverages per week was associated with a 60 percent higher increased risk of high blood pressure, or hypertension, in people with type 2 diabetes.\nA study published on September 9 in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that drinking only eight alcoholic beverages per week was associated with a 60 percent higher increased risk of high blood pressure, or hypertension, in people with type 2 diabetes. The risk and the severity of the high blood pressure grew for those who drank significantly more. The findings suggest that a daily drinking habit could put an already vulnerable group for heart disease at an even higher risk. Two out of three people with diabetes report having high blood pressure or taking medication to lower blood pressure, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA).\nA study published on September 9 in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that drinking only eight alcoholic beverages per week was associated with a 60 percent higher increased risk of high blood pressure, or hypertension, in people with type 2 diabetes. The risk and the severity of the high blood pressure grew for those who drank significantly more. The findings suggest that a daily drinking habit could put an already vulnerable group for heart disease at an even higher risk.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2023, explains the connection between diabetes and high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. It states that high blood pressure is twice as likely to affect people with diabetes and significantly increases the risk of heart disease. Two-thirds of adults with diabetes have high blood pressure or use medication for hypertension.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2003, discusses the effects of stress on blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It mentions that stress can raise blood sugar levels and make individuals less sensitive to insulin. Additionally, it mentions that guided imagery, biofeedback, meditation, hypnotherapy, and yoga can help reduce stress hormones and potentially stabilize blood sugar levels.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2019, discusses the connection between diabetes and hypertension, noting that people with diabetes have higher rates of hypertension compared to the general population. It also mentions that the DASH diet can help manage blood pressure and overall well-being, and that alcohol consumption should be limited to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2019, explains the relationship between alcohol consumption and blood pressure. It states that heavy drinking can raise blood pressure and that moderate drinkers are twice as likely to develop hypertension. People with diabetes who drink heavily are three times as likely to develop high blood pressure.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, but it discusses a study that found an association between moderate alcohol consumption and an increased risk of high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that drinking only eight alcoholic beverages per week was associated with a 60 percent higher increased risk of high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nClaim: Drinking Raises Blood Pressure Risk With Diabetes (Publication date: 2020-09-09)\n\nThe claim is consistent with Information 5, which states that a study found an association between moderate alcohol consumption and an increased risk of high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that drinking only eight alcoholic beverages per week was associated with a 60 percent higher increased risk of high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. This information supports the claim that drinking raises the risk of high blood pressure in people with diabetes.\n\nReasoning:\nThe claim is consistent with Information 5, which was published after the claim. The information in Information 5 supports the claim, and there is no evidence to suggest that the claim was made before the information was available. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is true based on the available information.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\n* Information 5, a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, found an association between moderate alcohol consumption and an increased risk of high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes.\n* The study's findings support the claim that drinking raises the risk of high blood pressure in people with diabetes.\n* The claim was published after the study was conducted, so it is reasonable to assume that the claim is based on the study's findings.", "response": "TRUE."}

We will also continue to engage with Note Circulation Scheme members and ATM operators to get an up-to-date view on customer demand for banknotes. We will continue to hold interviews with a range of large retailers to learn more about their cash holdings, the cash trends they are seeing and their attitudes to cash acceptance.\n2022 also saw travel disruptions, often due to staff shortages in the travel industry, which may be discouraging people from taking holidays overseas. Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

Early in the pandemic, it announced a policy to promote posts with accurate coronavirus information, to put warning labels on misinformation and to push it lower in people's feeds. At that point, the platform said it would remove false information “that could lead to imminent physical harm.” (Disclosure: News and information related to the pandemic published by AARP appears in Facebook's Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center.)\n9. “Did you know COVID-19 was actually patented (or predicted) many years ago?” Facebook will delete any posts that say COVID-19 has been patented or that it was predicted, including during the “Event 201” pandemic simulation hosted by Johns Hopkins University in 2019.\n“Did you know COVID-19 was actually patented (or predicted) many years ago?” Facebook will delete any posts that say COVID-19 has been patented or that it was predicted, including during the “Event 201” pandemic simulation hosted by Johns Hopkins University in 2019. 10. “The COVID-19 vaccine causes infertility.” Facebook forbids anything that says the COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people.\nIn an email, Facebook declined to say how many posts, pages and groups it has taken down under its newest rules, but it noted that it removed over a million pieces of content with harmful COVID-19 misinformation from Facebook and Instagram in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-12-18\nTitle: Keeping People Safe and Informed About the Coronavirus | Meta\nContent:\nGiven the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, we want people to be able to safely promote information about these vaccines on Facebook. We will now allow ads that highlight the ability of a COVID-19 vaccine to prevent someone from contracting the virus, as well as ads promoting ways to safely access a COVID-19 vaccine. We’ll continue to prohibit content that tries to exploit the pandemic for commercial gain.\nIn response to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic – particularly the challenges facing minority and women-owned businesses – we recently launched The Facebook Receivables Financing Program to support US-based suppliers.

AFWA confirms that posting a disclaimer on Facebook does not override the platform's terms and conditions.\n\nInformation 4 is from AARP, published in January 2022, discussing new Facebook rules targeting COVID-19 misinformation. The rules include deleting posts claiming COVID-19 was patented or predicted and forbidding content stating that COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people. Facebook reported removing over a million pieces of harmful COVID-19 misinformation in Q4 2020.\n\nInformation 5 is from Facebook's newsroom, published in December 2020. It highlights Facebook's efforts to keep people safe and informed about the coronavirus, allowing ads promoting COVID-19 vaccines and providing tools to manage time on Facebook. Facebook also joined other companies in signing the Open COVID Patent Pledge to help make patents freely available in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nGiven the information available, the claim that \"Facebook is using your pictures and posts in lawsuits against it amid the COVID-19 pandemic\" is false. The claim has been fact-checked and debunked by multiple sources, including Vishvas News and India Today AFWA. Furthermore, Information 4, published in January 2022, states that Facebook has been removing harmful COVID-19 misinformation, which contradicts the claim.

This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nThis cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially. Even though the Chinese government discredited the possibility of a lab origin based on genetic studies, the distance of the epicenter from the bat caves raises questions. Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThus, it is crucial to discover its origin to prevent another viral outbreak [1]. The main theories regarding the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) are that it arose naturally, as a zoonotic infection, that it was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon [2, 3], or that it has accidentally leaked out from a bio lab in China by researchers that were studying a virus related to the SARS coronavirus.\nWhile study results proposed and supported the theory of COVID-19 as a resultant of a naturally-occurring event, there is another suggestive theory stating SARS-COV-2 is an intentionally engineered virus that was unintentionally released from a bio lab in Wuhan, China. The origins of the epidemic and the “probable” bat source have raised skepticism. The Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Did coronavirus come from a lab? | New Scientist\nContent:\n<strong>The</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> <strong>is</strong> not a bioweapon and most likely originated in animals.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years.\nThe estimates presented may be an early indication of excess mortality related to COVID-19, but should be interpreted with caution, until confirmed by other data sources such as state or local health departments. It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data.\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.\nAs some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.

While the FDA has cautioned against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing COVID-19 due to their lack of effectiveness and potential side effects, these drugs are still being investigated in clinical trials. However, the claim is misleading as it implies that chloroquine is no longer being used to treat COVID-19, which is not the case.

The issue became a trending topic and appeared visible to all users on Twitter within the United Kingdom. Since then, multiple videos and news articles have been shared across social media linking the two together. The conspiracy has been of such a serious nature that, in Birmingham and Merseyside, United Kingdom, 5G masts were torched over concerns associating this technology and the spread of the disease according to the British Broadcasting Corporation [9]. More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10].

More concerningly, Nightingale hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom had its phone mast set on fire [10]. This is unwelcome damage especially at a time when hospitals are required to operate with maximum efficiency. The independent fact-checking website Full Fact noted that the conspiracy was not true and concluded that the theories given to support the 5G claims were flawed [11]. The National Health Service Director, Stephen Powis, noted in a press conference that the 5G infrastructure is vital for the wider general population who are being asked to remain at home.\nLivingston E, Bucher K.

Next generation 5G wireless networks: a comprehensive survey. IEEE Commun Surv Tutorials.\nAmongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The conspiracy of Covid-19 and 5G: Spatial analysis fallacies in ...\nContent:\nOthers have argued that 5G was first tested in Wuhan, China, the city linked to the first cases of COVID-19, which proves it is the cause of the virus. Still others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020).\nStill others claim that COVID-19 is only the latest iteration of mobile towers causing disease; before this, 3G caused SARS, and 4G Swine flu (Reuters, 2020). In all iterations, 5G is depicted as either “Satan's strategy” to advance the apocalypse, or the work of a techno-capitalist government cabal that seeks to reduce the population, profit from a vaccine, or embed micro-chips into the vaccine for the purposes of surveillance or control (Wu, 2020).\nWith education and trust shown to be predictors of both conspiracy theory beliefs and public health compliance/confidence, it is ever more essential that the evidence base of such narratives is interrogated (Tomeny et al., 2017; van Prooijen, 2016). Postings asserting the correlation between COVID-19 cases and 5G share some common features (see Appendix 1). They typically contain point data in the form of 5G-carrier tower locations, some with added coverage radii, and choropleth data on COVID-19 (mainly confirmed case and death counts, or case and death rates).\nThey typically contain point data in the form of 5G-carrier tower locations, some with added coverage radii, and choropleth data on COVID-19 (mainly confirmed case and death counts, or case and death rates). The correlation is typically depicted using overlays of point distribution and regional rate data, with COVID data aggregation varying from national (country) to sub-national (i.e. U.S. States). There is little discussion of aggregation issues, or of the comparability between point data (that identify items in location or specific places) and ecological data (that identify some characteristic of a larger area such as a county, local authority area, or electoral division).\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: ‘Corona? 5G? or both?’: the dynamics of COVID-19/5G conspiracy ...\nContent:\nWe hope, however, that the present analysis contributes substantially to that aim by tracing in detail the developments around the nonsensical belief that 5G technology could cause or exacerbate the symptoms of a severe viral infection. 1.Similarly, it has been argued that the myriad conspiracies regarding the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 are so enticing because the official version of events forces us to face the uncomfortable truth that such death and destruction could be caused by 19 men wielding only box-cutters.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic that has spread from its origins in Wuhan, China, around the globe since late 2019 has been accompanied by a similarly global ‘infodemic’, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out (Ghebreyesus, in United Nations, 2020b). This is unsurprising: the outbreak of the mystery disease now generally labelled COVID-19 and its gradual spread through the population necessarily resulted in many uncertainties about the severity and mode of transmission of the virus, about effective protection mechanisms and remedies, about government initiatives to detect the virus and slow its spread and about the longer-term personal, social and economic impacts of the social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures put in place.\nFocussing in detail on one key component of the infodemic surrounding COVID-19, this article traces the dissemination dynamics of rumours that the pandemic outbreak was somehow related to the rollout of 5G mobile telephony technology in Wuhan and around the world. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our analysis shows the dissemination of the rumour on Facebook from its obscure origins in pre-existing conspiracist groups through greater uptake in more diverse communities to substantial amplification by celebrities, sports stars and media outlets.\nThe rumour also builds upon a series of related narratives regarding the possible health and environmental impacts of 5G technology, and arguably flourished in large part thanks to the pre-existing networks and misinformation surrounding it. These rumours fit very strongly into the category of ‘conspiracy theory’, which itself arguably forms a separate subset of the mis- and disinformation categories noted above.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-09\nTitle: Here’s where those 5G and coronavirus conspiracy theories came ...\nContent:\nWhen hundreds of starlings were found dead in a road in North Wales in December 2019, those vocal in the anti-5G community made the same accusations. In reality, mass deaths of birds aren’t uncommon (and predate 5G technology) and the UK government monitors them to check for disease outbreaks. It wasn’t just birds.\nIn reality, mass deaths of birds aren’t uncommon (and predate 5G technology) and the UK government monitors them to check for disease outbreaks. It wasn’t just birds. The claims that 5G was dangerous to human health was also backed up by supposed examples of harm to trees.\nBut one thing that it’s important to realise is that there isn’t one single “5G conspiracy theory”. Instead, there are multiple theories, which sometimes overlap, but can also contradict each other. Look at some of the larger anti-5G groups on Facebook, and you can find these claims sitting alongside each other: that the virus is the real cause of the disease, but 5G is making it worse, that the virus is not the cause of the disease and all the symptoms are actually caused by 5G, and that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown.\nFor this faction, 5G wasn’t causing Covid-19 symptoms, it was now being used by the government as a distraction, so 5G could be installed across the country without delay. Some claim the virus was made in a laboratory, or that it was a completely different disease, or that there was in fact no outbreak at all.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nZignal Labs, an impact intelligence platform that studies online discourse, identified a Twitter account that on January 19 tweeted, “Wuhan has 5,000+ #5G base stations now and 50,000 by 2021 — is it a disease or 5G?” while retweeting a Russia Today article about a new, flu-like virus in China. Although the post got little engagement, it’s a sign that the theory had already been spreading to some degree.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak. Three months later, conspiracy theorists making similar claims were setting cellphone towers on fire in Europe. Gregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread.\nGregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread. Two days after the French blog post, a Belgian newspaper called Het Laatste Nieuws published an interview with a local doctor, who floated the unfounded claim that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to 5G cellphone towers installed near Wuhan in 2019.\nOthers float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n1. In early January 2020, social media users started linking 5G and COVID-19, claiming that 5G either causes or accelerates the spread of the virus. This conspiracy theory has been debunked by fact-checkers and health officials.\n2. Some people claim that 5G was first tested in Wuhan, China, where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported, suggesting a connection between the two. Others claim that previous mobile network technologies (3G and 4G) caused SARS and Swine flu.\n3. Social media posts claiming a correlation between 5G and COVID-19 typically contain point data for 5G tower locations and choropleth data for COVID-19 cases or death rates. These posts often lack discussion of data aggregation issues and the differences between point and ecological data.\n4. The conspiracy theory has spread globally, with anti-5G groups and individuals claiming that 5G is causing or exacerbating COVID-19 symptoms, or that the virus is a hoax to enable 5G installation.\n5. The conspiracy theory has been linked to a French conspiracy website and a Belgian newspaper, which published unfounded claims about a connection between 5G and COVID-19.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that 5G is causing disease and deaths is FALSE. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by health officials and fact-checkers. The theory has spread on social media, with various claims about a connection between 5G and COVID-19, but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.

In Nairobi, for example, accused persons prefer to be arraigned before the Makadara courts, which, in contrast to the Milimani courts, are perceived to be more lenient in granting bail.\nFor example, it is not unusual that a person accused of obtaining Ksh. 8,000 will be required to pay a cash bail of Ksh. 50,000. In addition, where two or more persons are accused of the same offence, the courts tend to set uniform bail terms for all of them, without distinguishing their circumstances.54 Further, there is no uniformity in how courts approach bail.\nIn Nairobi, for example, accused persons prefer to be arraigned before the Makadara courts, which, in contrast to the Milimani courts, are perceived to be more lenient in granting bail. To enhance uniformity in bail decision-making, some courts have tried to standardize their approaches. In Kitale, for example, the courts have a policy of giving cash bail of at least Ksh. 300,000 in defilement cases and Ksh.\nEven more disturbing, some police officers have detained persons accused of committing offences that are not known to law, contrary to section 50(n) of the Constitution, which gives an accused person the right not to be convicted for an act or omission that was not an offence under the law at the time of the commission or omission. A typical example is the offence of “city planning” in respect of which several persons have been arrested and detained at the Kamukunji Police Station in Nairobi.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: the penal code - chapter 63\nContent:\nPolice Hot Lines - 999 / 112 / 911 · We are here <strong>to</strong> serve <strong>you</strong> during the following business hours: At your service 24/7 Contact Us Today\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: What happens in the Kenya process when you give out cash bail in ...\nContent:\nAnswer: The Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) empowers an officer in charge of a police station or a court to admit a person accused of an offence – other than murder, treason, robbery with violence, attempted robbery with violence and any related offence – to bail or release on executing a bond with...\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by AfricaCheck on April 24, 2020, states that the claim about a KSh6,000 cash bail for not wearing a mask in downtown Nairobi is false. The information was confirmed by Nairobi county's communications and protocol officer, Lydia Gatheru. Kenya's minister of health has issued a directive making it an offense not to wear face masks in public places, with a maximum penalty of KSh20,000. This rule applies across the country, not only in the capital.\n\nInformation 2, published without a specific date, supports Information 1.

Cash bail is determined by the facts and circumstances of each case, not set at a specific amount.\n\nInformation 3, published without a specific date, explains the bail process in Kenya. Cash bail varies depending on the offence and the court. For example, a person accused of obtaining Ksh. 8,000 might be required to pay a cash bail of Ksh. 50,000. However, this information does not support the claim about a KSh6,000 cash bail for not wearing a mask.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 are not relevant to the claim, as they do not provide any information about cash bail for not wearing a mask.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that you have to pay a cash bail of KSh6,000 if you're caught without a mask in downtown Nairobi, Kenya is false. This was confirmed by Lydia Gatheru, Nairobi county’s communications and protocol officer, and the claim originated from WhatsApp and Facebook. The Kenyan minister of health has issued a directive making it an offense not to wear face masks in public places, with a maximum penalty of KSh20,000.

But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nCOVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nHome testing kits are available which can help confirm your infection and let you know when it is safe to be around others. Local health officials and their online portals can also advise you where to go for testing and treatment. Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.\nThe FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps: Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick.

Science, abg6296, this issue p. 1439 · Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is still under debate.\nAirborne transmission is one of the main pathways for the transmission of respiratory viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Wearing face masks has been widely advocated to mitigate transmission. Masks are thought to protect people in two ways: (i) source control, reducing the emission and spread of respiratory viruses through airborne droplets and aerosols, and (ii) wearer protection, reducing the inhalation of airborne respiratory viruses.\nIn this work, we develop a quantitative model of airborne virus exposure that can explain these contrasting results and provide a basis for quantifying the efficacy of face masks. We show that mask efficacy strongly depends on airborne virus abundance. On the basis of direct measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples and population-level infection probabilities, we find that the virus abundance in most environments is sufficiently low for masks to be effective in reducing airborne transmission.\nUnder this assumption, wearing a mask would have the same effect on the transmission of a virus disease at any level of infection probability. Our analysis, however, shows that the efficacy of face masks depends strongly on the level of infection probability and virus abundance: Masks reduce the infection probability by as much as their filter efficiency for respiratory particles in the virus-limited regime but much less in the virus-rich regime (Fig.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2013-08-06, provides recommendations on preventing the transmission of COVID-19, including wearing high-quality face masks, washing hands, keeping surfaces clean, and getting vaccinated.

The more conservative style that covers the face is called the burqa, and it covers the entire face and body, with mesh in front of the eyes (“A Brief History of the Veil in Islam”). The burqa is used mostly in Afghanistan, where it has been enforced by the Taliban and certain colors are seen in specific regions (Lundt). There is also another type of face covering that is now seen extremely rarely. It is a mask called a battoulah worn around the Persian Gulf (Lundt).\nFace coverings in the Middle East are most commonly associated with Islam. Muslim women usually cover their hair, and sometimes wear an additional veil that covers all or part of their face. However, the use of the veil and face coverings predates Islam in the Middle East, and Islam is not the only religion that sees meaning in veils (“A Brief History of the Veil in Islam”). Before being adopted by Islam, the veil was already being used in the Middle East, especially by Jewish and Christian women, for whom it was representative of their high status, or a “retreat from public life” (“Muslim Veiling”). Also most commonly associated with women, face coverings are worn by men in some parts of the Middle East as well.\nIslam adopted the practice of veiling from local Middle Eastern cultures, and then kept the practice as Islam spread throughout the world (“A Brief History of the Veil in Islam”). Within Islam, the veil or covering the face is most closely associated with modesty, which is an extremely important value for both Muslim women and men (“A Brief History of the Veil in Islam”). Islamic texts like the Qur’an and the Hadith mention the use of the veil or headscarf for women to preserve their modesty, especially around men, but they are somewhat unclear on whether it is actually a requirement for Muslim women (Lundt).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-08-25\nTitle: Battoulah - Wikipedia\nContent:\nBattoulah (Arabic: البطولة, romanized: al-baṭṭūlah), also called Gulf Burqa (Arabic: البرقع الخليجي), is a metallic-looking fashion mask traditionally worn by Muslim Arab women. The mask is mainly worn in the Persian Gulf region, including Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iraq and Qatar, as well as in southern Iran.\nThe mask is mainly worn in the Persian Gulf region, including Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iraq and Qatar, as well as in southern Iran. The mask usually indicates that the wearer is married. Historically, it was also used to fool enemies into thinking that the women they spied from a distance were actually men.\nThe variant worn in Sharjah resembles the Zabeel cut, but is shaped so the top of the mask is inclined forwards. The Al Ain design features both a narrow top and bottom. The Bahraini and Qatari burqa is square. In Oman and Fujairah it is very large and broader at the top with a tip that goes beyond the forehead. In neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the niqab is worn instead.\nIn neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the niqab is worn instead. In southern provinces of Iran, Shia women wear red rectangular masks, while those of Sunni women are black or indigo with gold, similar to the mask worn in the Arabian peninsula. In Qeshm, the masks were designed to fool invaders, so they would mistake women for male soldiers.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-12-31\nTitle: Niqāb - Wikipedia\nContent:\nCulturally, in the modern world, the face veil has been considered by some to be \"a custom imported from Najd, the Saudi region and the power base of its Salafi fundamentalist form of Islam.\" The Sydney Morning Herald added, \"Within Muslim countries it is very contested and considered fringe.\" In parts of the Muslim world outside of the Arabian Peninsula, where the niqab is less extensively worn, it is regarded warily by Sunni and non-Sunni Muslims \"as a symbol of encroaching fundamentalism.\"\nThis phenomenon was encouraged by the rise of \"Petro-Islam\" by the monarchy of Saudi Arabia in response to the consolidation of the revolution, which funded many mosques to adopt neo-Wahhabi, Salafist ideologies worldwide, resulting in the rise of the niqab becoming a noticeable consequence of the Islamic revival in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, and of Saudi Arabia's newfound cultural dominance over the Arab world. Since the 2000s the niqab has attracted significant controversy in the Western world, being perceived as a visible sign of growing Salafist extremism and a rejection of Western society. Culturally, in the modern world, the face veil has been considered by some to be \"a custom imported from Najd, the Saudi region and the power base of its Salafi fundamentalist form of Islam.\"\nPartial ban – government bans full-face veils in some locations · In 2016, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Bulgarian parliament. In autumn 2017, the Danish parliament (Danish: Folketinget) agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear \"attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability\".\nThe original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a \"justified cause\", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others – including local governments – disagree and claim religion is not a \"justified cause\" in this context. In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Austrian parliament.\nA niqāb or niqaab (/nɪˈkɑːb/; Arabic: نِقاب niqāb, \"[face] veil\"), also called a ruband, (Persian: روبند) is a garment, usually black, that covers the face but not the eyes, worn by some Muslim women as a part of an interpretation of hijab.

Around 40,000 people, including Tablighi Jamaat attendees and their contacts, were quarantined across the country.\nSenior BJP leaders like Shivraj Singh Chouhan attributed Tablighi Jamaat congregation for a spike in cases of COVID-19 in the country, a claim which was disputed by experts from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College in Indore saying that they have no data to link the spread of the pandemic to the congregation.

The syndrome occurs when immune cells are activated and release large amounts of cytokines into the body.\nThe syndrome occurs when immune cells are activated and release large amounts of cytokines into the body. Cytokines are small proteins that act as cell messengers to help direct the body’s immune response. However, high levels of cytokines may cause increased inflammation throughout the body.\nAt-risk patients will be monitored for about a month after an immunotherapy infusion. Patients who develop symptoms usually improve within 1-2 weeks. Most patients do not have long-term problems from cytokine release syndrome.\nChimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T-cell therapy, is one treatment associated with cytokine release syndrome. CAR T-cell therapy doctors return modified T cells to patients to recognize and attack cancer cells. Management of CRS includes monitoring and laboratory tests, treating specific symptoms, and medicines to lower the immune response.

Yet, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters, such as age, sex, and health conditions, are not clearly driving the superspreading phenomenon.\nDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is marked by cluster transmission phenotypes in which 80% of new infections are driven by <20% of infected individuals [1., 2., 3., 4.]. In contrast, influenza virus transmission is likely less cluster driven, with a more uniform transmission trajectory. Detailed contact tracing of influenza infections is not routinely conducted, complicating similar analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.\nRelease of virus-laden aerosols in a large-size range contributes to both close-up and long-range transmission [11,58]. At close contact all modes of transmission are possible and transmission is highly efficient. Close-contact transmission likely accounts for linear secondary transmission events (Figure 1, gray circles), although not all infections will result in a secondary infection.

Bourdeaux and Cameron are health policy experts. Professor Zittrain teaches law and computer science. As Covid-19 cases surge to their highest levels in dozens of states, the nation’s testing effort is on the brink of paralysis because of widespread delays in getting back results. And that is very bad news, because even if testing is robust, the pandemic cannot be controlled without rapid results.\nDelays averaging a week or longer for all but top-priority hospital patients and symptomatic health care workers are disastrous for efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Without rapid results, it is impossible to isolate new infections quickly enough to douse flare-ups before they grow. Slow diagnosis incapacitates contact tracing, which entails not only isolating those who test positive but also alerting the infected person’s contacts quickly so they can quarantine, too, and avoid exposing others to the virus unwittingly.\nAmong those who waited an absurdly long time for her results was the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms. “We FINALLY received our test results taken 8 days before,” she tweeted last week. “One person in my house was positive then.

Scientists may have identified a specific order for COVID-19 symptoms.\nAdditionally, although these diseases’ symptoms overlap with COVID-19, what distinguishes the novel coronavirus from them is the timing and symptoms in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. “The upper GI tract (i.e., nausea/vomiting) seems to be affected before the lower GI tract (i.e., diarrhea) in COVID-19, which is the opposite from MERS and SARS,” the researchers wrote. In all diseases, the scientists observed that fever and coughing occur before nausea, vomiting, or both, and diarrhea.\nThe scientists recommend that personnel should test people for fever before they are allowed entry to facilities. Furthermore, as public spaces start to reopen after the outbreak of the virus, they suggest physicians and other healthcare professionals should record the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases as part of good clinical practice.\nIn all diseases, the scientists observed that fever and coughing occur before nausea, vomiting, or both, and diarrhea. “This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,” emphasizes senior author, Peter Kuhn, Professor of Biological Sciences and Professor of Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, and Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering at USC Dornsife.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2022-04-19\nTitle: COVID-19 symptoms appear in a specific order, study finds - Big Think\nContent:\nNow researchers from the Kuhn Lab as University of Southern California have discovered something that may be useful for anyone questioning whether they’ve been infected with COVID-19.

Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur.

Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion.

So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak.

There are many things, like taking warm baths, getting plenty of rest, or eating and drinking honey, lemon, tea, ginger, and other foods that may help people feel better when they are sick. However, there is no clear evidence that these foods/drinks are reliable home remedies to cure an illness or infection.\nHealth experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that tea will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\nHot Khaada (or kadha or karha): Khaada is a drink often made with a combination of herbs, spices, and other additives that may include cloves, black pepper, ginger, basil, cardamom, fennel seeds, honey, ghee, amongst others. It is commonly used to “boost immunity” when people are sick. To date, there are no studies that evaluate Khaada as a therapy for COVID-19, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that Khaada will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organization has a specific statement on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that lemon prevents or treats COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that lemon can successfully prevent or cure COVID-19 whether consumed as a drink, inhaled as steam, or when placed in the nose.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Taming the pandemic? The importance of homemade plant-based foods ...\nContent:\nFor the prevention of COVID-19, the Ministry for “traditional” medicine has widely promoted in the media the consumption of herbal teas or the inhalation of steam from preparations of introduced species like chamomile, cypress (Cupressus sargentii Jeps.), lemongrass, and eucalyptus. Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.\nFinally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system. Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well.\nThe most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon. Our preliminary inventory of food medicines serves as a baseline for future systematic ethnobotanical studies and aims to inspire in-depth research on how use patterns of plant-based foods and beverages, both “traditional” and “new”, are changing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020), a botánica (shop selling Caribbean remedies for health and wellbeing) in the Bronx reported selling much greater volumes online of eucalyptus, chamomile, and anamú (Petiveria alliacea L.), to treat COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, fever, and trouble breathing, together with other plants that allegedly ease anxiety. In an 8-min home video shared on Facebook, a Jamaican-American woman demonstrated how to make “Corona-shots” by blending common Caribbean kitchen ingredients (turmeric, lemon, ginger, onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, and honey).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Africa: Acclaimed home remedies ...\nContent:\nLiterature was compiled from google, social media, Radio and Television commentaries and news with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The standard dose is three Paxlovid pills twice daily for five days for a full course that adds up to 30 pills.\nPaxlovid, the pill that has become the go-to treatment for COVID-19 treatment, was granted full approval in May by the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults at high risk for severe disease, including hospitalization and death. The drug also remains available to everyone 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who has mild-to-moderate disease and is at high risk for severe disease under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Paxlovid is an oral antiviral pill that can be taken at home to help keep high-risk patients from getting so sick that they need to be hospitalized.\nIt’s cheaper than many other COVID-19 drugs (at this time, U.S. residents eligible for Paxlovid will continue to receive the medicine at no charge), and, perhaps most reassuring, it is expected to work against the latest Omicron subvariants. “It's really our first efficacious oral antiviral pill for this virus,” says Scott Roberts, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist.\nThe FDA also granted an EUA in December to a pill from Merck called molnupiravir (Lagevrio), but some studies suggest that molnupiravir has only a 30% reduction in the risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19. We asked Yale Medicine infectious diseases experts common questions about Paxlovid. Below are their responses. Paxlovid is an antiviral therapy that consists of two separate medications packaged together. When you take your three-pill dose, two of those pills will be nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a key enzyme that the COVID virus requires in order to make functional virus particles.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Fujifilm's flu drug Avigan improves COVID-19 recovery time, setting ...\nContent:\nRELATED: Fujifilm speeds production of potential COVID-19 therapy Avigan · Avigan is already approved in Japan to treat new or reemerging infleunza; early in the coronavirus pandemic, researchers highlighted the antiviral's potential against the novel coronavirus.\nJapan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, previously said the drug could be approved in COVID-19 by May. In the U.S., the Trump administration eyed Avigan as a potential coronavirus treatment early in the pandemic, according to a Politico report. The FDA hasn't issued an emergency use authorization for the drug in COVID-19, and U.S. officials have never approved it in influenza.\nAside from Avigan, a few other medicines have demonstrated efficacy in COVID-19. Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir, Eli Lilly’s Olumiant in combination with remdesivir, Roche's Actemra and older steroids such as dexamethasone, have posted positive data so far. Meanwhile, drugmakers are advancing novel antibodies and vaccines, with some already in late-stage testing.\nThe FDA hasn't issued an emergency use authorization for the drug in COVID-19, and U.S. officials have never approved it in influenza.

He was also a member of the CDU–CSU–SPD coalition working group, which brought about the 2007 health reform.\nAfter the 2013 federal elections, Spahn criticized the coalition pact between CDU/CSU and the SPD for making too many concessions to the SPD on lowering the retirement age from 67 to 63 for some workers. In November 2018, Spahn called for Childless Tax where Childless people should be paying much more towards care and pension insurance than those who have started a family. As part of coalition negotiations, Spahn and others succeeded in bringing \"core demands for a black and yellow health policy\" against the opinion of some like Rolf Koschorrek, in the form of a rearrangement of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG).\nJens Georg Spahn (born 16 May 1980) is a German politician who served as Federal Minister of Health in the fourth cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2018 to 2021. A member of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he has been the member of the lower house of the federal parliament, the Bundestag (German: Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages, MdB), for Steinfurt I – Borken I since 2002.\nAt the time of his election in 2002, Spahn – at age 22 – was the youngest member of the CDU in the German parliament. He has since then served in the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and currently in the 20th Bundestags and is one of the main sponsors of pension reform in Germany.

As a young, openly gay man who has built up credibility on serious policy areas such as finance and health, the 35-year-old Spahn has the potential to rejuvenate the aging party and broaden its appeal — while keeping its conservative core satisfied.\nConvinced after Merkel’s reelection victory that he would be named health minister, Spahn was left to stew in the position he had already had for four years, as the conservatives’ spokesman on health policy in the Bundestag. He bounced back in spectacular style: By the CDU national convention in December 2014, he had built enough backing to bid for a seat on the executive committee, the decision-making inner circle of the CDU. His speech began like those of the other candidates, reeling off conservative clichés about “the party of hard-working people,” and the applause was suitably tepid.

This virus appears to have originated within Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17,18,19. In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705).

The video accompanying the following tweet claims that the new Bank of England £20 note happens to include pictures of a coronavirus and a 5G tower: Let’s try to follow the logic here. The claim is that someone, let’s say the British government, is going through all of this elaborate effort to conceal the supposed link between 5G and COVID-19 but then would turn around and print a picture of a coronavirus and a 5G tower on money for everyone to see.\nWell, it looks like the “timing” evidence behind this Timber-link is as strong as the “evidence” provided for the claimed radiowaves, 3G, 4G, 5G link.

Well as this NBC2 News segment shows, some have tried to use the map argument:\nThe claim here is that since more COVID-19 cases are appearing in locations where more 5G towers are present, the two must be linked. After all, doesn’t correlation automatically mean causation? The answer is absolutely not. Correlation alone does not mean causation. For example, if you were to map out the number of times people laugh and fart at the same time, which incidentally is called “larting,” you’d probably see a similar geographic distribution. Why?

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a significant correlation between PTSD and BOS, and that the pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma, increasing PTSD among HCWs.\n\nInformation 3, published on March 2, 2022, discusses a study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration that explores the connection between nurses' practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The study aims to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions for nursing staff members.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of preventing PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients.

Lockdowns and school closures had a serious impact on children’s development. Keeping children indoors kept them safe from COVID-19. But it also robbed them of critical experiences that help them develop. As children navigate life beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, parents should watch out for a few possible scenarios:\nIf they are having trouble thinking clearly, they should have an evaluation more focused on neurology. In most cases, children recover from long COVID within a few months. But for some children, it can take a long time to feel better. During this time, it’s important that parents keep an eye on their child’s mental health.\nCountless children in South Asia have lost loved ones and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. And if children have never been exposed to death before, facing loss for the first time can be as confusing as it is upsetting. There is no ‘correct’ way to grieve, and no specific stages in which different emotions or behaviours should appear.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-07-31\nTitle: The Big Read in short: Covid-19 fallout spells trouble for ...\nContent:\nThe mental health of students is in the spotlight following an alleged murder at River Valley High School which shook the nation · The Covid-19 pandemic and reduced interactions in school have exacerbated perennial stress factors · Some teachers and parents say they’ve noticed children becoming more subdued and withdrawn, and counsellors warn of a prolonged impact on students’ mental health\nApart from coping with perennial stressors of the educational system and growing up in the social-media age, students in the past 17 months and counting have had to deal with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Statistics provided by Mr Chan, in a written parliamentary response separate from his ministerial statement, showed that the incidence of suicide among young people aged 10 to 19 rose last year, compared with 2019, as part of an overall increase in people here taking their own lives during the pandemic.\nCounsellors said that the restricted interactions with others due to Covid-19 safe distancing measures have exacerbated mental health issues faced by children here. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to TODAY’s queries that the number of students who have seen or have been referred to their school counsellors for social, emotional or mental health issues has remained “largely stable” over the last few years. Since the pandemic started early last year, students have gone through several periods of home-based learning (HBL), and have to abide by strict safe distancing measures in schools, such as sitting individually and apart in classrooms.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-05-22\nTitle: Lessons learned from COVID-19: how did the pandemic affect ...\nContent:\nCountries can continue to encourage healthy choices through laws that make fruits and vegetables more affordable, and by imposing taxes on sugary drinks and creating health promotion campaigns.  · “Not only is home-cooked food often healthier, it can also be less expensive, which is important for families in the current environment, when many people need to find ways to cut costs in their household expenses,” added Dr Wickramasinghe. Unfortunately, the pandemic also presented new challenges for children.\nThirty per cent of children became less physically active during this period, missing out on the health benefits of activities such as cycling, playing football or running around in the park.  · In addition, during the lockdown period over 35% of children spent more time watching television, playing video games or using social media, increasing their sedentary time, thus putting themselves at greater risk of becoming overweight and obese, and increasing their exposure to marketing of unhealthy products via digital media.\nThese data provide invaluable insights into the consequences – both good and bad – of the pandemic and the effects it had on children. This is one of the largest studies of its kind, and the lessons learned can help countries to plan for future emergencies and pandemics. “The lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of implementing effective policies to improve food environments, encourage physical activity, and protect the health and well-being of families.\nLockdowns, restrictions, and emergency policies have changed our diets, physical activity patterns and many other daily habits that are tightly connected to our well-being.

The first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to quantitively and reproducibly assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection has been published by a team of Italian experts with experience of using the technology on the front line.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients. The National Health Service in England does not even mention lung ultrasound in its radiology decision tool for suspected COVID-19, specifying instead chest X-ray as the first-line diagnostic imaging tool, with CT scanning in equivocal cases.\nWith regard to the use of wireless technology, the Italian team says that \"in the setting of COVID-19, wireless probes and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment,\" as they can \"easily be wrapped in single-use plastic covers, reducing the risk of contamination,\" and making sterilization easy. Stone suggests that integrated portable devices, however, are no more likely to cause cross-contamination than separate probes and tablets, as they can fit within a sterile sheath as a single unit. Volpicelli, for his part, doesn't like what he sees as undue focus on wireless devices for lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 protocols.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-09\nTitle: First protocol on how to use lung ultrasound to triage COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nThe first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to quantitatively and reproducibly assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection has been published by a team of Italian experts with experience using the technology on the front line.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients.

Then we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID‐19 care pathways. Finally, we present outpatient use of lung ultrasound to aid follow‐up of positive case contacts and of those discharged from the hospital.\nThe current application of lung ultrasound into triage flowcharts is limited by the lack of standard scanning protocols and operator experience, which may influence the validity and interpretation of test results.

Resumen de Salud Pública: Dióxido de cloro y clorito (Chlorine Dioxide and Chlorite) | PHS | ATSDR.\nChlorine dioxide is a reactive synthetic gas that has been used in the paper industry, decontamination of public buildings, and water purification [5]. Its high reactivity explains its properties to eliminate microorganisms, however, this also determines the potential adverse effects [5]. Despite this, chlorine dioxide has been promoted as a cure for diseases such as malaria, HIV and cancer, among others [13]; it has also been proposed to prevent or treat COVID-19 [14]. However, there is no evidence on the efficacy of chlorine dioxide for such purposes, but there is evidence on its harmful effects, so institutions such as the Pan American Health Organization do not recommend its use [15].\nIn addition, the prevalence of chlorine dioxide consumption as a treatment is twice as high as its consumption for prevention. This could be explained by the fact that the diagnosis of COVID-19 can generate greater anxiety [18], and, therefore, desperation to act against the condition, leading to a greater susceptibility to consume this type of substance that is sold as a “miracle cure” for the disease [19]. Both as prevention or treatment of COVID-19, the consumption of this substance can have fatal consequences.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-03-31\nTitle: Can chlorine dioxide prevent the spreading of coronavirus or other ...\nContent:\nThe current epidemic coronavirus is known to be present in the mouth and both in the upper and lower respiratory tract, but causes severe infections only in the lower respiratory tract, especially in the lung.

These permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines self-medication (SM) as the selection and utilization of medicines to treat self-recognized symptoms or ailments without consulting a physician [1]. It also includes the usage or re-usage of previously prescribed or unused drugs, direct purchasing of prescription drugs without consultation, and irrational use of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs [2]. SM is a significant concern globally, affecting both developed and developing countries [3, 4]. Various studies have indicated that SM is a common practice, with a prevalence of 32.5–81.5% worldwide [5]. The most commonly self-prescribed medications are analgesics, antipyretics, antit\nIvermectin is sold OTC in some countries, and people are self-medicating and, more concerningly, self-dosing it for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, the WHO has provided several warnings to observe caution when using SM to treat COVID-19, including the irrational use of antibiotics, herbal remedies, and other OTC drugs [15]. Many herbal drugs have been used to treat COVID-19 in China, Pakistan, and other countries worldwide.\nIn developing countries, such as India, the use of SM with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine without a prescription to prevent COVID-19 has been documented [12]. Later, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as being unsafe in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 based on their therapeutic safety profile in COVID-19 patients [13]. Similarly, while UK researchers have declared dexamethasone to be a ‘life-saving drug’ in the treatment of severe COVID-19, the UK Minister of the National Health Service stressed that dexamethasone should only be used in critically ill patients and should not be used as an SM in mild to moderate cases due to its inherent safety problems [14]. Ivermectin is sold OTC in some countries, and people are self-medicating and, more concerningly, self-dosing it for the treatment of COVID-19.\nDuring health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people should seek advice from health experts before using any remedy. The use of self-medication could be improved by educating the public about the harmful effects of irrational drug use.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Over-the-counter medicines: Global perspective and Indian scenario ...\nContent:\nAs a library, NLM provides access to scientific literature.

Some social media posts circulating on Monday suggested Yeadon’s opinions were credible because of his former role as a chief scientist of allergy & respiratory research at Pfizer.\nCLAIM: The COVID-19 pandemic is “effectively over” and there’s no need for vaccines. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The claim, made in an article by a former employee at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, ignores that large numbers of people continue to fall ill and die from the coronavirus in many parts of the world. The United Kingdom, which is the subject of the article, saw a surge in coronavirus cases this fall and exceeded 50,000 coronavirus-related deaths earlier this month.\nAnd thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of COVID-19-related deaths are still being reported daily in the U.K., where Yeadon is based. Yeadon argues a larger portion of the population is immune to the coronavirus than government scientists assume because many people have previously been infected by different common cold-producing coronaviruses.\nTHE FACTS: A former Pfizer employee’s inflammatory claims denying global data are gaining traction on social media this week as the pharmaceutical company seeks FDA authorization to distribute its coronavirus vaccine. It started when Michael Yeadon, a retired British doctor, wrote an op-ed in October on a U.K.-based blog opposing government restrictions for the coronavirus. In the article, Yeadon wrote that the “pandemic is effectively over” and could “easily be handled” by the U.K.’s National Health Service if it were “properly functioning.” He also said there was “no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.”\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-27\nTitle: Ex-Pfizer Vice President’s claim ‘COVID is effectively over’ ...\nContent:\nThe video features a conversation between talk show host Julia Hartley-Brewer and Yeadon in which the former Pfizer VP made the similar claim that \"the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.\" According to Health Feedback, the video contains several inaccurate claims about the pandemic that were previously debunked by the organisation and other fact-checkers. Challenging Yeadon's claims, Health Feedback said that several European countries, including the UK, experienced a resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths starting in September and October. In the article published in Lockdown Sceptics, Yeadon made claims about a large section of the population having prior immunity against the disease.\nAfter drugmaker Pfizer's former Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy and Respiratory Michael Yeadon claimed that \"the pandemic is fundamentally over in the UK,\" health fact-checker Health Feedback termed his assertions \"false\".

Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is “over in the U.K.” is contradicted by data from both the U.K. government and Our World in Data showing that there is a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.K., going from below 5,000 in September to about 25,000 in November (Figure 2).\n\nThe claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is \"fundamentally over\" in the U.K. and that \"we now know loads of people had prior immunity to COVID-19\" was made in November 2020. However, this claim is false based on the available information and current understanding of the pandemic.\n\nAt the time the claim was made, there was a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.K. This trend was expected to persist for some time, contradicting the claim that the pandemic was \"fundamentally over.\"\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that some people who have never had COVID-19 have a certain type of immune cell (memory T cell) that can recognize SARS-CoV-2, the implications for immunity are still unknown. More studies are needed to determine the role of memory T cells in immunity to COVID-19. A person's antiviral immune response is comprised of several components, including antibodies, which can bind to certain proteins on the surface of the virus and prevent it from infecting cells. One of the key goals of COVID-19 vaccines is to stimulate the production of antibodies that prevent infection.\n\nIt is important to note that the claim was made by Michael Yeadon, a former scientific advisor to Pfizer. However, his opinions should not be considered credible solely based on his former role. Scientific claims should be based on peer-reviewed research and data, not on the opinions of a single individual.\n\nIn summary, the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is \"fundamentally over\" in the U.K. and that \"we now know loads of people had prior immunity to COVID-19\" is false based on the available information and current understanding of the pandemic. It is important to rely on accurate and up-to-date information from reputable sources to make informed decisions about COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The mRNA-1273 vaccine has been tested in animal models and has demonstrated some protective ability.  · Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, NIAID and Moderna scientists had been working together on an investigational vaccine to protect against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another type of coronavirus.\nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak, NIAID and Moderna scientists had been working together on an investigational vaccine to protect against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another type of coronavirus. Once the genetic sequence information for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus became available, the scientists were able to apply that to the existing mRNA platform to create the investigational mRNA-1273 vaccine. It is a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate different doses of the investigational mRNA-1273 vaccine for safety and their ability to induce an immune response in study volunteers.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-12-28\nTitle: Phase 3 trial of Novavax investigational COVID-19 vaccine opens ...\nContent:\nPeople 18 years of age and older who are interested in participating in this trial can visit coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and search identifier NCT04611802, or Novavax.com/PREVENT-19 for details.

The CoVPN includes existing NIAID-supported clinical research networks with infectious disease expertise and was designed for rapid and thorough evaluation of vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies for preventing COVID-19.\nIn animal tests, NVX-CoV2373 vaccination produced antibodies that blocked the coronavirus spike protein from binding to the cell surface receptors targeted by the virus, preventing viral infection. In results of a Phase 1 clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited higher levels of antibodies than those seen in blood samples drawn from people who had recovered from clinically significant COVID-19.\nIn results of a Phase 1 clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited higher levels of antibodies than those seen in blood samples drawn from people who had recovered from clinically significant COVID-19. NVX-CoV2373 also is being evaluated in a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, now fully enrolled with 4,422 volunteers, and data from a Phase 1/2 continuation trial in the United States and Australia is expected as early as first quarter 2021. Novavax also recently completed enrollment of more than 15,000 volunteers in a Phase 3 trial of the candidate vaccine in the United Kingdom, which is also testing two injections of 5 mcg of protein and 50 mcg of Matrix-M adjuvant administered 21 days apart.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-16, is a news article about the beginning of a Phase 1 clinical trial of an investigational vaccine for COVID-19, developed by NIAID and Moderna.

The trial is being conducted at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, and is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-07-27, is about the beginning of a Phase 3 clinical trial of an investigational vaccine for COVID-19, known as mRNA-1273. The vaccine was co-developed by Moderna and NIAID, and is being tested at U.S. clinical research sites. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 30,000 adult volunteers who do not have COVID-19. The vaccine uses the mRNA delivery platform to encode for an S-2P immunogen, which directs the body's cells to express the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and elicit a broad immune response.\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-03-16, states that \"NIH clinical trial of investigational vaccine for COVID-19 begins\". This claim is in line with Information 1, which states that a Phase 1 clinical trial of an investigational vaccine for COVID-19 has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.

Prayut ordered crackdown on social media posts that the government deemed \"fake news,\" accusing the people who did so of hampering the authorities' effort against the pandemic. The police also stressed that the crime may faced with a maximum of two years imprisonment under the Emergency Decree.\nOn 6 February 2020, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha warned that the stockpiling and price gouging of surgical masks and hand sanitisers could lead to legal consequences. On 12 March 2020, health officials encouraged people to make face masks at home out of cloth, stating that cloth masks can prevent droplets bigger than one micron from spreading.\nThe government has been criticised for various aspects of its response to the crisis, especially over its early handling of the pandemic, slow procurement of vaccines, and the April 2021 outbreak. In early February 2020, in response to concerns over hoarding and price gouging of face masks, the government issued price controls and intervened in their distribution. The move failed to prevent shortages among hospitals, and became a scandal over perceived corruption and siphoning of supplies. Criticism was also aimed at the government's inconsistent policy over international travel and quarantine requirements, indecisiveness and slowness to act, and poor communication—many official announcements were made available to the public, only to be quickly retracted or contradicted by other government units, and later changed.\nThe police demanded that the sign be taken down, but suggested that it could be rewritten in Chinese as \"We ran out of food\". A similar sign was seen outside a restaurant in Ao Sane Beach in Phuket. Health minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted negative comments on Twitter about \"dirty\" Westerners, saying they \"never shower\" and are more likely to spread the virus than Asians. The post attracted negative reaction in Thailand and the UK and was quickly removed.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on April 15, 2020, by AFP, states that a claim about police in Thailand fining people for not wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic is false.

However, Information 3, published in April 2021, states that fines for not wearing face masks were indeed imposed later due to a new wave of COVID-19 cases.

A seminal study from Wuhan, China reported higher serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in patients requiring critical care compared to those with milder disease, and the authors postulated that “cytokine storm was associated with disease severity” [1]. COVID-19 hypercytokinaemia initially invited comparisons to other respiratory viral infections that cause a dysregulated immune response, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\nDetailed immunological studies have clearly established that some patients with severe COVID-19 indeed meet the general criteria for cytokine storm syndrome in a manner which is unique from other infectious CSS. A recent longitudinal comparison in patients with moderate versus severe COVID-19 demonstrated three distinct signatures of “immunological misfiring” in those with severe disease [5]. Patients with moderate disease (patients admitted to hospital who survived and did not require intensive care unit (ICU) admission) had low expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased tissue reparative growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (figure 1a).\nThe modest serum IL-6 elevations reported in early studies of COVID-19 have been cited as an argument against the relevance of CSS in this disease [6, 7]. For example, the median (7–45 pg·mL−1) and IQR for serum IL-6 levels were relatively low in four large studies of patients with mild to severe COVID-19 [6]. However, median and IQR are estimates of central tendency, and in cytokine storm, the population of interest resides within the top quartile of patients. Further, the temporal heterogeneity of cytokine analysis in these studies may have missed rapid increases in cytokine levels in some patients.\nSome authors have proposed that the markedly elevated D-dimer levels and high rates of micro- and macrovascular thrombosis, in contrast to modestly elevated median IL-6 levels, signify that COVID-19 pathophysiological sequelae are related to hypoinflammatory vasculopathy rather than inflammatory cytokine storm [7]. The central role of the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in viral cell entry and the complex vascular changes, including intussusceptive angiogenesis and diffuse endothelial membrane disruption seen in autopsy studies, indeed support a central role for vasculopathy in COVID-19-related morbidity [22]. However, recent studies have demonstrated that hypercytokinaemia and vasculopathy are not an either/or proposition.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: The Current Evidence and Treatment ...\nContent:\nBesides, excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly involving macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, has been found in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 by postmortem examination.

Wang disputed the conclusions. She said U.S. officials did visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but in March 2018 — about two months after the Jan.\nDuring the roughly five-hour visit, which included a tour of the BSL-4 lab, where technicians clad in bubblelike protective suits handled small vials and other equipment while sealed inside a thick-walled glass enclosure, Wang Yanyi, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said she and others felt unfairly targeted. She urged that politics not cloud investigations into how the coronavirus spilled over into humans.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology, founded in the 1950s, is a prominent research facility that enjoyed an even more elevated profile after it opened the BSL-4 lab in 2015. These days, scientists at the lab are focused on the coronavirus, but normally, work at the facility includes research on some of the most dangerous known viruses, including the Ebola, Nipah and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever viruses.\nIt is partly because the Wuhan institute is equipped to study the world's highest-risk infectious agents and toxins — including those, like the latest coronavirus, that are believed to have originated in bats — that it is entangled in accusations that it had something to do with the outbreak.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-20\nTitle: Did Covid-19 Come From A Lab?

So how could we determine definitively if Covid-19 was a naturally occurring or bioengineered outbreak? The simple answer is: it’s complicated. I have previously covered the four potential ways a virus could “escape” a laboratory.\nThe latest accusation that the virus was engineered came from a Norwegian team of scientists, which was swiftly attacked by other virologists, who argued that the viral genetic material is similar to other viruses found in nature Still, adding fuel to the debate is the revelation that scientists from the Wuhan lab published articles that described manipulating coronaviruses (so called “gain of function” experiments) - thereby producing all the ingredients for conspiracy theories and suspicions of nefarious intent.MORE FROM FORBESA Bioweapon Expert Explains Four Ways A Pathogen Can 'Escape' From A LabBy Mark Kortepeter\nThere has been a lot of speculation about whether Covid-19 was a naturally occurring disease. Here, biodefense expert Dr. Mark Kortepeter explains what scientists look for in determining whether a disease outbreak might be deliberate.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-01\nTitle: Did COVID-19 Escape From a Lab? A Coronavirus Investigation\nContent:\nNikolai Petrovsky, a professor of endocrinology at Flinders University College of Medicine in Adelaide, Australia, said in an email, “There are indeed many unexplained features of this virus that are hard if not impossible to explain based on a completely natural origin.” Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, wrote that he’d been concerned for some years about the Wuhan laboratory and about the work being done there to create “chimeric” (i.e., hybrid) SARS-related bat coronaviruses “with enhanced human infectivity.” Ebright said, “In this context, the news of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan ***screamed*** lab release.”\nBotao Xiao, a professor at the South China University of Technology, posted a short paper on a preprint server titled “The Possible Origins of 2019-nCoV Coronavirus.” Two laboratories, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (WHCDC) and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, were not far from the seafood market, which was where the disease was said to have originated, Xiao wrote — in fact, the WHCDC was only a few hundred yards away from the market — whereas the horseshoe bats that hosted the disease were hundreds of miles to the south.\nIt was unlikely, he wrote, that a bat would have flown to a densely populated metropolitan area of 15 million people. “The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan,” Xiao believed. He urged the relocation of “biohazardous laboratories” away from densely populated places. His article disappeared from the server.\nAccording to State Department cables from 2018 leaked to the Washington Post, the new BSL-4 lab had some start-up problems, including “a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.” The staff had gotten some training at a BSL-4 lab in Galveston, Texas, but they were doing potentially dangerous work with SARS-like viruses, the memo said, and they needed more help from the U.S. In November or December of 2019, the novel coronavirus began to spread. Chinese scientists initially named it “Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus,” but soon that idea went away.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-17\nTitle: 23% of Americans think the coronavirus was created in a Chinese ...\nContent:\nResearchers surveyed people in five countries to assess which coronavirus-related conspiracy theories have taken root.

Genetic evidence discredits the theory that the coronavirus was man-made.\nLingering uncertainty how the coronavirus pandemic started creates fertile territory for conspiracy theories. About one in four Americans and Britons think the idea that the virus was engineered in a Wuhan laboratory is a \"reliable\" claim, according to a recent study, despite abundant scientific evidence to the contrary.\nThat showed it couldn't be a \"laboratory construct,\" or a \"purposefully manipulated virus,\" the study authors wrote. ... \"The genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" they added. Another theory suggests that the new coronavirus had animal origins, but that a sample of it collected for prior study accidentally leaked from a lab. Believers of this conspiracy generally point to the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the source of the leak, since scientists there study infectious diseases, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 1, published on September 17, 2020, states that scientists say the evidence points to a natural origin of the coronavirus and that there is no evidence supporting the claim that it was released from a laboratory in Wuhan. Information 2, published on August 11, 2020, describes the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its focus on researching the coronavirus, but it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the virus was created in the laboratory. Information 3, published on June 20, 2020, discusses the possibility of the virus escaping from a laboratory, but it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the virus was created in a laboratory.

The majority of the information consists of experts stating that the evidence points to a natural origin of the virus and that there is no evidence supporting the claim that it was released from a laboratory.

Posts featuring the cover of “The Eyes of Darkness” book and a page in which Koontz allegedly describes the coronavirus in his novel have at least 39,000 shares (examples here and here) and at least 2,000 retweets on Twitter (examples here and here) as of February 27, 2020.\nThis page does not belong to “The Eyes of Darkness”. It comes from the 2008 book “End Of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world” by Sylvia Browne, an American author who claimed to be a psychic (see the page here). This claim is therefore partly false. Dean Koontz did write about a fictional virus called “Wuhan-400” in the 1989 re-release of his 1981 novel “The Eyes of Darkness”, but symptoms and effects of the disease do not match the official description of COVID-19.\nPosts featuring the cover of “The Eyes of Darkness” book and a page in which Koontz allegedly describes the coronavirus in his novel have at least 39,000 shares (examples here and here) and at least 2,000 retweets on Twitter (examples here and here) as of February 27, 2020. Most of the claims circulating on social media show the book’s cover and a page in the book mentioning a virus called “Wuhan-400”. The widely circulated photo of Koontz’s book page includes some highlighted text reading: “They call the stuff ‘Wuhan-400’ because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan, and It was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center”.\nIn the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of “Gorki” and it was meant to be the “Soviet’s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade”. This is confirmed by a Google Books’ search of the word “Wuhan” in the 1981 edition (here). In this edition “Wuhan-400” brings no results. According to the South China Morning Post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the Cold War. Their article here includes photographs of the previous edition that references “Gorki-400”). In this edition, Koontz also published his novel under his real name instead of using his pseudonym “Leigh Nichols”.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-03-13\nTitle: No, Dean Koontz did not predict the coronavirus in a 1981 novel | CNN\nContent:\nOne particularly striking example comes from a thriller novel by Dean Koontz called “The Eyes of Darkness.” · In a tweet that has since been widely shared, someone said that Koontz had predicted the coronavirus outbreak based on a screenshot of a page in the book.

Koontz did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n“The book written by Dean Koontz in 1981, ‘The Eyes of Darkness,’ wrote on pages 353 to 354 that China has developed a virus known as Corona Virus in a lab in the city of Wuhan, to be used in the future as weapon in future wars or to disturb future economic imbalance amongst the world powers or control its population,” the post reads.\nWe rate the claim that Dean Koontz predicted the coronavirus in his “Eyes of Darkness” novel as FALSE because it is not supported by our research.

The said advisories were released through online messaging platforms, a route UNICEF Philippines refuted it took with health advisories. ?? Misinformation on COVID-19 UNICEF does not issue coronavirus advisories on chat apps.\nThe misinformation poll on the virus has been described by WHO as an “infodemic”. This it says means there is “an overabundance of information — some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.” · Covid-19 which has killed more than 3,500 people worldwide is believed to have originated from China late last year.\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has dismissed viral erroneous messages which issued purported advisories on the deadly COVID-19. Unicef Deputy Executive Director for Partnerships Charlotte Petri Gornitzka said the messages were “dangerous” and “wrong” and could spread paranoia, fear, stigmatisation and “result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus.” · “For example, a recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-03-07\nTitle: False: Graphics or social media cards supposedly from UNICEF contain ...\nContent:\nHome <strong>Graphics</strong> or social media cards supposedly from <strong>UNICEF</strong> <strong>contain</strong> tips <strong>and</strong> <strong>information</strong> on how to prevent and combat the coronavirus outbreak <strong>and</strong> <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong>.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 response | UNICEF\nContent:\nUNICEF is reaching millions of children and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, thanks to the generous support of our donors and partners. ...

Experts at the Health Desk project created by technology and journalism non-profit Meedan have said: “The claim that the prolonged use of face masks can cause oxygen deficiency, dizziness, or other health challenges is not grounded in science.”\nThe claim that face masks can cause bacterial pneumonia is also false. It has been repeatedly debunked, as have claims that masks can cause other diseases. Even simple cloth masks are effective at preventing the spread of Covid-19, and their use is recommended by medical experts.\nAre masks really dangerous to your health? The article in the photo was published in the Light, a free United Kingdom-based newspaper that describes itself as a “truthpaper”. The Light quoted Margarite Griesz-Brisson, a doctor who has claimed without evidence that wearing face masks “will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide”.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-30, is a fact-check by AFP addressing claims made by German neurologist Margareta Griesz-Brisson in a video. Griesz-Brisson claims that masks cause oxygen deprivation and a flood of carbon dioxide in the body, leading to nerve cell death in the brain. Peter Berlit, Secretary General of the German Society for Neurology, confirmed that while nerve cells can die without oxygen, this cannot be triggered by wearing a mask.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-10-19, is a fact-check by USA Today addressing claims that masks cause neurological damage and oxygen deprivation. Medical experts state that there is no evidence linking masks to neurological damage or oxygen deprivation.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-10-21, is a fact-check by Reuters addressing claims made by conspiracy theorist David Icke about the safety of masks. Icke cites Griesz-Brisson's video and claims that masks are unsafe and ineffective. Learnaboutcovid19.org, a global team of public health experts, states that masks are generally safe and effective for most people. A study from U.S. researchers found that masks do not limit the flow of oxygen to the lungs.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-11-04, is a fact-check by Health Desk addressing claims that masks cause brain damage, oxygen deprivation, and other health issues. Experts deny these claims and state that masks do not contribute to brain harm.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-03-10, is a fact-check by AFP addressing claims that masks cause brain damage, bacterial pneumonia, and organ failure. Experts state that masks do not cause oxygen deficiency, CO2 intoxication, or bacterial pneumonia.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that experts say wearing face masks does not cause neurological damage is true. Multiple sources, including AFP, USA Today, Reuters, and Health Desk, have fact-checked and debunked claims that masks cause neurological damage, oxygen deprivation, or other health issues. These sources cite medical experts and studies that support the safety and effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe earliest publication date among the provided information is 2020-10-19, and the latest is 2021-03-10. The claim in question was published on 2020-10-26, which falls within this time range. Therefore, the information provided is relevant to the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that experts say wearing face masks does not cause neurological damage is true, based on the provided information and available evidence. Masks are a safe and effective measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and there is no evidence to support claims that they cause neurological damage or other health issues.", "response": "FALSE."}

Over the past 18 years, her team has collected more than 20,000 samples from bat colonies across China.\nShi jumped at the opportunity, joining an international team to collect blood, urine, saliva, and feces from bat colonies in mountainous areas across China. They found SARS-like coronaviruses in bats within a year, but it took nearly a decade to prove that bats were the source of the contagion.\nOthers, however, don’t think Shi’s work indicates lax biosafety standards in China. The dominant view among scientists worldwide was—and to some extent still is—that bat coronaviruses would most likely have to evolve in an intermediate animal first before they could infect humans.\nIn previous studies, Shi and her colleagues found that up to 4% of people living close to bats and working closely with wildlife in southern China were infected with dangerous animal-borne viruses, including coronaviruses; the infection rate was 9% among butchers.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-12\nTitle: Police in China are Using AI Helmets to Screen for Coronavirus ...\nContent:\nIf a person is showing signs of an elevated temperature, the helmet’s smart glasses will create a “digital record” and put that information in a nationwide database.

While it is a general medical term used to describe a damaging immune and blood-clotting response to a lung injury, DAD is not a disease, but instead a condition potentially caused by a variety of diseases. That finding — along with the presence of clotting cells known as \"platelet-fibrin thrombi\" in the patients' lungs — suggested to the authors that preventing complications from blood clotting (coagulopathy) could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments.\nPerhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection. \"Breaking Covid news!\" began a loosely intelligible bit of copypasta from late May, \"Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium.\"\nThe claim that went viral on several social media platforms blends the misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper with the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that no autopsies be performed on COVID-19 victims — a paranoid flourish used to imply a global conspiracy. By ignoring this alleged ban, the story goes, Italian doctors revealed that COVID-19 was actually a bacteria, and that, for some reason, aspirin can cure the disease.\nAn inaccurate copypasta description of this study from mid-May interpreted those results as evidence that Covid-19 stemmed from \"a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,\" that death from the disease stems from thrombosis (or blood clotting), and that the COVID-19 \"ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.\" This is how aspirin entered the zeitgeist. As a drug with anticoagulant properties, it could theoretically be employed to reduce complications from thrombosis. Perhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* COVID-19 is a virus, not a bacterium (Information 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n* The World Health Organization (WHO) has conducted a systematic review of 73 studies into the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, disclofenac, and naproxen on acute respiratory viruses and found no evidence to prove aspirin could cure or treat COVID-19 (Information 1).\n* Claims that COVID-19 is a bacterium that can be treated with aspirin or a coagulant are false and have been debunked by fact-checkers and government fact-checking agencies (Information 3 and 4).\n* A preliminary and unpublished research paper from Italy suggested that preventing complications from blood clotting could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments (Information 5).\n* Online claims that this Italian study exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection and that aspirin can cure the disease are baseless and have been debunked (Information 5).\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that COVID-19 is a bacterium that is easily treated with aspirin or a coagulant is false. Multiple sources have confirmed that COVID-19 is a virus, not a bacterium, and that there is currently no specific treatment for it or a vaccine to prevent it. Claims that aspirin or a coagulant can cure or treat COVID-19 have been debunked by fact-checkers and government fact-checking agencies.

Congress could technically extend the ability to postpone an election to the Executive, as mentioned in this 2004 Congressional Research Service report ( fas.org/sgp/crs/RL32471.pdf ). However, given the Democrats’ current control of the House, as well as the possibility of legal challenges, this is extremely unlikely.\nWhile Congress does hold the power to change the election date, it could not postpone it indefinitely.

In March, Gov. John Bel Edwards and Secretary of State R. Kyle Ardoin did just that. (In fact, they later postponed the primary election for a second time, buying more time for the state to prepare to hold its vote amid the pandemic.)\nIt was reported in 2004 that some Bush administration officials had discussed putting in place a method of postponing a federal election in the event of a terrorist attack.

One way—and the more realistic of two unrealistic scenarios—is for Congress to change the federal law. That means a bill needs to pass in the House and the Senate and get signed by Trump.\nThe second option is for Congress to transfer its decision-making ability to Trump. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report found that Congress could delegate its powers to the executive branch as long as it includes standards so that a court can \"ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed.\" The CRS found no \"apparent reason\" why that doctrine wouldn't extend to the power to set the date for a national election.

Disclosure: Anna Sayburn has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. For decades, we've been promised that telemedicine will save primary care money and time. Yet somehow, for most NHS GP services, face-to-face consultations have remained standard operating procedure. Why go to the hassle of introducing video consultations, when everyone can pop down to the surgery? The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly changed all that.\nProfessor Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, has produced a guide on introducing video consultation for practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. She agrees that infrastructure is a problem: \"Some of them [GPs] are making it work and some are really struggling because they haven't got the infrastructure. Infrastructure issues are going to be mission critical.\" The move to online working has exposed weaknesses in the technology available to primary care, says Dr Jameel.\nBut do remote consultations work as well as face-to-face visits, even when the technology is in place?

One of the more comprehensive looks at this topic was a systematic review of telemedicine practice in primary care before the pandemic, including 81 studies conducted both domestically and abroad.30 The results from this study have been supplemented by other publications conducted during the pandemic, and general conclusions about patient outcomes for different categories of careare summarized below.\nThe typical model for direct-to-consumer telemedicine is a single encounter between a clinician and patient who have no preceding relationship, and the clinician is often limited by lack of on-site testing, no means to bring patient in for a face-to-face examination, and little way to ensure the patient will access follow-up care if they get worse. Telemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.\nTelemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.

However, there is no mention of Coronavac being rejected by Chinese authorities.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, states that Coronavac is one of two Chinese vaccines already being used in more than 70 nations and will soon be more widely available to low-income countries.\n\nInformation 3, published on Apr 17, 2021, reveals that Chile, which relies heavily on Coronavac, is considering administering a third dose due to waning immunity. The vaccine has proven less effective than Western inoculants, and its efficacy in Chile was questioned before the publication of local study results.\n\nInformation 4, published on Mar 6, 2023, discusses China's disinformation and propaganda about the pandemic's origin, but there is no mention of Coronavac being rejected by Chinese authorities.\n\nInformation 5, also without a specific publication date, mentions that billions of shots of CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines have been given globally, but studies have questioned their length of protection.\n\nClaim:\nThe Washington Post published that Coronavac was rejected by Chinese authorities.\n\nBased on the provided information and reasoning, the claim is:\n\nFalse\n\nThe claim states that The Washington Post published that Coronavac was rejected by Chinese authorities, but there is no evidence in the provided information or a simple online search supporting this claim. On the contrary, Information 2 and 3 indicate that Coronavac has been used in more than 70 nations, including Brazil and Chile. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Chinese authorities would reject a vaccine that has already been administered to millions of people and forms a crucial part of other countries' vaccination campaigns.", "response": "FALSE."}

Mammalian cells are not affected by sulfonamides because they are unable to make their own folic acid and have evolved mechanisms for transporting external folic acid across their membranes. In general, drugs that effectively inhibit viral infections are highly toxic to host cells because viruses use the host's metabolic enzymes in their reproduction.\nThe term \"disease\" refers to conditions that impair normal tissue function. For example, cystic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and measles are all considered diseases. However, there are fundamentally different causes for each of these diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to a specific genotype that results in impaired transport of chloride ions across cell membranes, leading to the production of abnormally thick mucus.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2016-11-15\nTitle: Biomagnetics - Health Restored\nContent:\nBut it is very difficult to remove the fungus without removing the virus that is providing the acidic environment. A similar condition exists between bacteria and parasites. Parasites often feed on bacteria, so parasites can actually keep bacteria under control.\nBiomagnetics can have an antimicrobial effect by increasing immune function through the oxygenation of white corpuscles, an important part of the immune system’s arsenal. It is important that we eliminate pathogens in a systematic way. For example, Viruses provide the acidic environment for fungus to grow.\nAcupuncturists are now using Biomagnetics as a painless form of acupuncture that also allows the affects to continue long after a visit. An American double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the effects of static magnets on the treatment of arthritis shows that magnets have a significant positive effect on the transmission of pain through the nerve cells4. Some bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics that were once commonly used to treat them.\nBiomagnetics summary Biomagnetics, or Biomagnetic Therapy, uses pairs of powerful neodymium magnets to help eliminate disease-causing pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasistes and fungi) from the body. Briefly, when pathogens get established in the human body, they cause pH variances in certain areas along the body’s natural meridians.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-17\nTitle: Viruses, Bacteria and Fungi: What's the Difference? | Cedars-Sinai\nContent:\nWhat makes a <strong>virus</strong>, like the highly contagious strain now causing a worldwide pandemic, different from other germs, such as <strong>bacteria</strong> or a fungus?

Even when they are obligate parasites, they use their own machinery for DNA replication, transcription, and translation, and they provide their own sources of metabolic energy. Viruses, by contrast, are the ultimate hitchhikers, carrying little more than information in the form of nucleic acid.\nSince most of the critical steps in viral replication are performed by host cell machinery, the identification of effective antiviral drugs is particularly problematic. Whereas the antibiotic tetracycline specifically poisons bacterial ribosomes, for example, it will not be possible to find a drug that specifically poisons viral ribosomes, as viruses use the ribosomes of the host cell to make their proteins.\nWhereas the antibiotic tetracycline specifically poisons bacterial ribosomes, for example, it will not be possible to find a drug that specifically poisons viral ribosomes, as viruses use the ribosomes of the host cell to make their proteins. The best strategy for containing viral diseases is to prevent them by vaccination of the potential hosts. Highly successful vaccination programs have effectively eliminated smallpox from the planet, and the eradication of poliomyelitis is imminent (Figure 25-16).\nUnlike bacteria and eucaryotic parasites, viruses have no metabolism of their own and no intrinsic ability to produce the proteins encoded by their DNA or RNA genomes. They rely entirely on subverting the machinery of the host cell to produce their proteins and to replicate their genomes.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-14, is an article from Maldita.es debunking the claim about biomagnetism therapy's ability to kill the COVID-19 virus.

Some studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 might affect female fertility and disturb female reproductive functions.8 9 Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, there appears to be a potential decline in fertility.10 A study reported that many young adults have sexual and reproductive health problems due to COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures.11 It has been reported that COVID-19 is usually accompanied by high levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-α and other cytokines, which trigger a procoagulant state that is unfavourable to the development of blastocyst or fetus in a normal human uterus.12 An epidemiological study demonstrated that coronaviruses could have adverse effects on fetuses and infants, including preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, \nIt is generally accepted that fertility starts at (approximately) 13 years of age, and women begin to become infertile at age 49 years.40 With ageing, the female fertility naturally declines. The decline in fertility in women aged 30–35 years is slow and steady; however, the decline accelerates after the age of 35 years due to decreases in the ovarian reserve and oocyte quality.41 The subgroup analysis will assess the impact of COVID-19 on the fertility of women aged <35 years and >35 years.\nMesserlian C, et al.

However, the review did not suggest that the coronavirus will render most patients infertile.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the sequential relationship between the date of publication of the claim and the date of publication of the information, the claim that the latest research published by Chinese scientists said that the coronavirus will render most patients infertile is not true.", "response": "FALSE."}

The record-breaking hole was caused by an unusually strong and enduring polar vortex and healed when the vortex split – not because of COVID-19 closures. India Times, \"Earth Finally Fixed Largest Ozone Layer Hole Above Arctic, Healing 1 Million Square Km\"\n“Note that the healing of the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer has nothing to do with the ongoing reduction in pollution due to COVID-19 lockdown,” India Times wrote. Despite India Times’ statement otherwise, Facebook readers speculated about the effect COVID-19 closures may have had on the ozone.\nThe naturally occurring ozone high in the atmosphere is the \"good\" ozone and is in contrast to the \"bad\" ozone near the surface, which is man-made pollution that can cause respiratory problems.

Several feel-good stories about the earth recovering have gone viral since the coronavirus pandemic forced the world indoors. Amid this, scientists have confirmed that the largest hole in the ozone layer over the Arctic region has closed in.\nSeveral Twitter users have also claimed that the Covid-19 lockdown is the reason behind the phenomenon. ... On April 23, 2020, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), the European Union’s earth monitoring programme, announced that the largest hole ever observed in the ozone layer over the Arctic has closed.\nCAMS has been closely following the one million square km-wide ozone layer hole that had formed over the Arctic in March. Several people on the CAMS Twitter handle said the phenomenon is the outcome of the global Covid-19 lockdown. The agency then clarified that it has nothing to do with the lockdown.\nSeveral people on the CAMS Twitter handle said the phenomenon is the outcome of the global Covid-19 lockdown.

Instead, it's down to the polar vortex, the high-altitude currents that normally bring cold air to the polar regions. This has split in two giving the Arctic region a relative heatwave, with temperatures up to 20ºC higher than is normal for this time of year. The polar vortex weakened and split in two has diluted the ozone holeCopernicus ECMWF\nThis has split in two giving the Arctic region a relative heatwave, with temperatures up to 20ºC higher than is normal for this time of year. The polar vortex weakened and split in two has diluted the ozone holeCopernicus ECMWF · This year the polar vortex has been extremely powerful and temperatures inside it have been very cold. This generates stratospheric clouds that destroy the ozone layer by reacting with CFC gases, banned by the 1987 Montreal Protocol.\nThe banning of these gases by the Montreal Protocol in 1987 has allowed a reduction in the Antarctic ozone hole and even the gradual restoration of atmospheric currents in the southern hemisphere, according to a recent study. Last year's reduction in the ozone hole was also due to an extreme episode of stratospheric warming.

Despite coronavirus lockdowns leading to a significant reduction in air pollution, researchers said the pandemic likely was not the reason for the ozone hole closing. \"Actually, COVID19 and the associated lockdowns probably had nothing to do with this,\" CAMS tweeted Sunday.\nAccording to recent data from NASA, ozone levels above the Arctic reached a record low in March. The \"severe\" ozone depletion was certainly unusual — 1997 and 2011 are the only other years on record when similar stratosphere depletions took place over the Arctic.\nAfter signing the Montreal Protocol in 1987, 197 countries agreed to phase out chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons in order to protect the ozone from further damage, which has contributed to a decrease in the size of the hole over Antarctica. Without those regulations, the Arctic ozone hole this year could have posed a threat to human health.\nHuman-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons have been destroying the layer for the past century, eventually causing the famous hole that formed in Antarctica in the 1980s. Experts pointed to \"unusual atmospheric conditions\" as the cause of the most recent hole, leading to industrial chemicals interacting with high-altitude clouds at abnormally low temperatures.  · \"This year's low Arctic ozone happens about once per decade,\" Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland said in a press release.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-01\nTitle: Record ozone hole over Arctic now closed\nContent:\nAccording to recent data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), ozone levels above the Arctic reached a record low in March. ... The discovery of an ozone hole above Antarctica in 1985 led to the approval of the Montreal Protocol two years later,in which 197 countries agreed to phase out chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone from further damage and decrease the size of the hole.\nIt's now back to normal again ... the ozone hole has closed,\" she said. Scientists monitoring the hole at the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), a European Union earth observation program, announced the closure last week. ... Despite coronavirus lockdowns resulting in a significant reduction in air pollution, Nullies said the occurrence of the hole healing \"was completely unrelated to COVID.\"\n\"Actually, COVID19 and the associated lockdowns probably had nothing to do with this,\" CAMS tweeted. \"It's been driven by an unusually strong and long-lived polar vortex, and isn't related to air quality changes.\" ...
