And the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. Read more: After early success, India's daily COVID infections have surpassed the US and Brazil. Why?\nTo cover its entire adult (over 18 years) population, India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines. If these vaccines were to be administered over the next 12 months, India would need 161 million doses each month, or 5.4 million doses each day.\nCovishield is the Indian name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin, on the other hand, was developed jointly by India’s public sector and a private company named Bharat Biotech.\nCountries around the world are racing against time to vaccinate their populations against the coronavirus. But India has thus far been a poor performer, with only 9.6% of its population receiving a vaccine so far (compared to 51.8% in the UK, 45% in the US, 32.1% in Germany and 14.9% in Brazil).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-22\nTitle: If the COVID-19 vaccine prices are too high for some, then why ...\nContent:\nIndia is a developing country with millions of poor people with poor access to, and little money to spare for, healthcare. By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it. However, there is a problem with letting private and for-profit companies charge different prices from different customers. These are the prices fixed by Serum Institute of India (SII) for the Covishield vaccine:\nBy allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities. “Pricing should be uniform. Both the central and state governments should pay the same price for the vaccine.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-06-10\nTitle: For all its “made in India” pitch, Covaxin is the most expensive ...\nContent:\nRaches Ella, a project lead at the company, tweeted that the last volunteer for Covaxin’s phase 3 trial was vaccinated in mid-March, and it takes time to sift through data and to publish results in a peer-reviewed publication. Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. Private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose.\n\nInformation 3 is a repetition of Information 1.\n\nInformation 4, published after the claim, discusses the debate around the high prices of the Covishield vaccine and the argument that the vaccine should be free for all. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nInformation 5, published after the claim, states that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, costing Rs. 1,200 ($16.42) per dose. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context. The claim should have specified that the vaccine is free of cost in public healthcare facilities in India, but not necessarily in private healthcare facilities.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. This information is from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making it a reliable source. Additionally, Information 5, also published after the claim, supports the fact that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, further emphasizing the importance of specifying the cost of the vaccine in private healthcare facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency.\nIn the wake of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the practice of ophthalmology has undergone a dramatic and unprecedented shift. The inherent risk of transmission is high due to the need for patient proximity during an ophthalmic exam or surgery, which has led to at least one outbreak in Norway [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. In March 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued practice guidelines and released a list of emergent ophthalmic surgical procedures to be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15]. Subsequently, the rescheduling of routine ocular examinations and limiting procedures to those deemed urgent or emergent has been the basis of many recent publications [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Each has offered specialty specific guidelines to limit transmission moving forward, while allowing for the gradual increase in ophthalmic exams, intraocular injections, and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nAdherence to these recommendations has resulted in an estimated 75% or more reduction of in-person clinic volumes [28]. Concurrently, the implementation of telemedicine visits resulted in an alternative way to provide continued care [3, 25, 29,30,31]. However, the exact reduction of in-patient visits, increase in telemedicine encounters, and the change in the types of diagnoses seen within in an ophthalmology clinic before and after COVID-19 remains unknown.

This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: ICU and ventilator mortality among critically ill adults with ...\nContent:\nIn addition, while patient volumes did merit the re-designation of several specialty intensive care units as COVID ICUs, all critically ill patients with COVID-19 were admitted to pre-existing ICUs and cared for by critical care teams with experience managing acute respiratory failure and at standard patient-to-provider ratios. Further, while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report, our internal guidelines emphasized early intubation and standard lung-protective ventilation strategies. Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual patient risk factors, clinical interventions and treatments, and health system factors that can improve mortality in the face of this global pandemic.\nThese data indicate that a majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can have good clinical outcomes and support the ongoing use of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure. In some of the earliest reports of COVID-19 from Wuhan, mortality rates among those admitted to ICUs ranged from 52–62%, and increased to 86–97% among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.5,6,15,16 In more recent data from the United Kingdom, 67% of those who had received mechanical ventilation died, as compared to 22% of patients intubated with viral pneumonia in the preceding three years.3 Early reports of smaller cohorts from Seattle, where some of the first COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in the United States, indicated that 50–67% of patients admitted to the ICU and 71–75% of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation died.1,2 A recently published report from New York also found high mortality of 88.1% among those who required mechanical ventilation.4\nDespite multiple reports of mortality rates exceeding 50% among critically ill adults with COVID-19, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, our early experience indicates that many patients survive their critical illness. COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is estimated that 15–20% of cases require hospitalization and 3–5% require critical care. While experience with COVID-19 continues to grow, reported mortality rates range from 50–97% in those requiring mechanical ventilation.1-6 These are significantly higher than the published mortality rates ranging from 35–46% for patients intubated with H1N1 influenza pneumonia and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).7-10\nThese high mortality rates have raised concerns as to whether invasive mechanical ventilation should be avoided in the context of COVID-19.11-14 To help address the growing concern that critical illness, and specifically mechanical ventilation, are associated with a high risk of death, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 across our academic health system. This is an observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to six COVID-designated intensive care units (ICUs) at three Emory Healthcare acute-care hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia from March 6, 2020 through April 17, 2020.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care (ICU) - Our World ...\nContent:\nAn interactive visualization from Our World in Data.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: ICU outcomes and survival in patients with severe COVID-19 in the ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 7 million of people around the world since December 2019 and in the United States has resulted so far in more than 100,000 deaths [1]. Epidemiological studies have shown that 6 to 10% of patients develop a more severe form of COVID-19 and will require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [2]. Most of these patients admitted to ICU, will finally require invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) due to diffuse lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Until now, most of the ICU reports from United States have shown that severe COVID-19-associated ARDS (CARDS) is associated with prolonged MV and increased mortality [3].

One Q follower has argued that the symptoms of Covid-19 are suspiciously “similar to exposure to 5G,” which is not true, and has linked the rollout of 5G in Italy to the country’s high infection rate.\nThe genre of conspiracy theories linked to wireless technology has been around for decades, and the debate over whether things like cellphones lead to brain cancer or mind control has gained newfound relevance with the rollout of 5G technology. Some theories postulate that 5G, like earlier generations of cellular technology, also causes cancer or, somehow, kills birds.\nOne Q follower has argued that the symptoms of Covid-19 are suspiciously “similar to exposure to 5G,” which is not true, and has linked the rollout of 5G in Italy to the country’s high infection rate. She said in a tweet, “If you try to connect the dots from Covid-19 (which I am implying is a made-up illness to explain the side effects of the 5G rollout) to 5G, the media will tell you it is a conspiracy theory.”\nMany of the sites that promoted 5G conspiracy theories are now steering their audiences toward the 5G coronavirus connection. The “uncensored health news” website Natural News, for example, has long warned of the supposed dangers of 5G technology.

In recent days there have been suspected arson attacks on mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Merseyside. Celebrities have pushed the idea that 5G is harmful and linked to Covid-19.\nTo be clear, these theories are wrong. As you'll see from our fact checks linked throughout this article, there's no connection between 5G and coronavirus, and no evidence of any health risk from 5G. But it's not clear that simply dismissing them is the right approach.\nWhile the conspiracy theories about 5G and the coronavirus pandemic burst into public awareness at the start of April, they have been building online for months. We started seeing the link between 5G and coronavirus claims in the second half of January, shortly after the virus started getting significant UK media coverage, but before the outbreak had been declared a pandemic.\nOne of the first 5G and coronavirus claims we checked, that the disease had broken out in Wuhan because of 5G there, re-emerged with claims that Covid-19 hotspots were also covered by 5G, and that cases on cruise ships could be explained by the radiation emitting technology used on them.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Four experts investigate how the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory ...\nContent:\nGoogle, for example, curates coronavirus-related search results, meaning that they only return authoritative sources and feature links to those sources where advertisements would usually have appeared.

The information provided by Poynter, USA Today, and other sources consistently debunks this claim, stating that there is no connection between 5G and the coronavirus. Furthermore, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Federal Communication Commission have jointly emphasized that 5G technology does not cause the coronavirus.\n\nThe misconception that 5G and coronavirus are linked seems to have originated in January 2020 and gained traction online in the following months.

On the other hand, the leaked Chinese Government report from February 2020 appears to show officials hurriedly looking back to see what was going in hospitals in October and November, with no indication they knew at the time – and also no indication of an “out of control” epidemic.

Very recently, some African countries have reportedly claimed that the anecdotal use of an extract of A. annua is efficacious for COVID-19 management, albeit with no scientific evidence demonstrated. In ethnobotanical practice, the whole plant is commonly used for treating malaria, cough, and cold (Nigam et al.\nScientific articles and reports on Artemisia and Artemisia-based products for the management of SARS-CoV-2 were carefully accessed from online databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Researchgate COVID-19, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Web of Science and other scientific databases on COVID-19 such as WHO situation reports on COVID, US National Library of Medicine and Chinese clinical trial registry were also accessed using the keywords; Artemisia, Artemi, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.\nHerbal medicine is predominantly utilized in countries like China, India, Egypt and many others on the African continent for the treatment of several (mild and severe) ailments and infectious diseases, including coronavirus infections (Jin et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiological agent of COVID-19 (WHO 2020c).\nThese permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The search for a potent anti-coronavirus therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains an overwhelming task since the outbreak of COVID-19. It is more evident that most of the existing antiviral and immune-boosting drugs are non-promising and ineffective for the treatment of coronavirus infected patients while the safety of a few drugs/vaccines that have demonstrated high potential remains unclear.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Artemisia Extracts and Artemisinin-Based Antimalarials for COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nIn South Africa, teas of Artemisia afra were used without in vitro or clinical data [96]. A. afra, in contrast to A. annua, does not contain artemisinin. Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19 [97], the WHO recently called for investigations into the efficacy of plant-based traditional medicines [98]. Human clinical trials will be required to answer the question whether the traditional medicines may indeed have an effect in either preventing or treating COVID-19 infections.\nThe Artemisia species, such as A. annua and A. afra, in particular, exhibit positive effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 related symptoms. A. annua is a source of artemisinin, which is active against malaria, and also exhibits potential for other diseases. This has increased interest in artemisinin’s potential for drug repurposing. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, so-called ACTs, have already been recognized as first-line treatments against malaria. Artemisia extract, as well as ACTs, have demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.\nArtemisinin-based combination therapies, so-called ACTs, have already been recognized as first-line treatments against malaria. Artemisia extract, as well as ACTs, have demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Artemisinin and its derivatives have also shown anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a key role in the development of severe COVID-19.\nDespite vaccine developments, COVID-19 treatment still remains largely supportive with an urgent need to identify effective anticoronavirals. An attractive approach is repurposing drugs already licensed for other diseases. In this respect, several studies have been undertaken to test whether antimalarial drugs could treat COVID-19. Teas of Artemisia annua L. plants have been employed to treat malaria [14,15,16] in many African countries.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-09\nTitle: Coronavirus: What do we know about the artemisia plant?\nContent:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is to test a malaria drug on Covid patients, which is derived from the artemisia plant used in Madagascar. The African island nation attracted a lot of attention last year when it announced it was promoting a drink containing artemisia plant extracts to combat coronavirus. There's no evidence so far that this plant can combat Covid-19.\nAnd scientists in South Africa have been doing laboratory tests on artemisia annua and another variety of the plant - artemisia afra - for effectiveness against Covid-19. The active ingredient found in the dried leaves of artemisia annua is called artemisinin, and it does work against malaria. Chinese scientists pioneered the discovery of its properties when they were searching for a cure for malaria in the 1970s. Chinese scientists on the search for a malaria cure · Artemisinin-based combination therapies - known for short as ACTs - are recommended by the WHO against malaria, especially those types now resistant to chloroquine, which is one of the main drug treatments for the disease.\nIt's a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant, used for decades to treat malaria. The drug will be part of an on-going trial involving researchers in hospitals around the world, looking at treatments for the most seriously ill Covid patients. Four other drugs that were part of an earlier phase of this trial were found to have little or no effect on hospitalised patients. The WHO says there is currently no evidence that artemisia-derived products are effective in treating Covid-19.\nThere's no evidence so far that this plant can combat Covid-19. Artesunate is one of three new drugs to be tested on hospitalised Covid patients. It's a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant, used for decades to treat malaria.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: In vitro efficacy of Artemisia extracts against SARS-CoV-2 | Virology ...\nContent:\nThe clinical benefits of Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug approved for treatment of COVID-19, are being discussed controversially [7], such that COVID-19 treatment remains largely supportive. Repurposing of drugs already licensed for other diseases is a comparatively fast method to meet the urgent need for effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Artesunate 2 and other synthetic derivatives of the sesquiterpene lactone natural product artemisinin 1 (Fig. 1) that is isolated from Artemisia annua plants, are the key active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of WHO-recommended anti-malaria combination therapies, used in millions of patients every year with few side effects [8]. Teas made from the leaves of A. annua plants are recommended in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat malaria [9] and teas from Artemisia plants are widely used in many African countries to treat malaria patients, albeit contrary to WHO recommendations [10].\nIn South Africa, teas of A. afra that—in contrast to A. annua—do not contain artemisinin 1, were used widely without in vitro or clinical data [19]. In Madagascar, Covid-Organics, a drink containing mainly A. annua extract and/or plant material, was announced by the President of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina as a “miracle cure” in April 2020, subsequently used in the country and exported to several African nations in hope to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections [20]. Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19, the WHO issued a warning against the use of traditional medicines [21]. More recently, the WHO modified its recommendation and called for an investigation into the potential efficacy of plant-based treatments [22]. To date, no in vitro data concerning anti-viral effects of A. afra plant extracts or Covid-Organics has been disclosed.\nHuman phase 2 clinical trials are currently ongoing to test the efficacy of these substances in treating COVID-19 [18]. Other groups reported similar findings concerning pure synthetic artemisinin derivatives [25] and whole A. annua plant material [17]. Reports that teas made from A. annua and A. afra plants [19], as well as Covid-Organics, a drink made from A. annua leaves and Ravensara aromatica in Madagascar [20], have been used throughout Africa.\nBackground Traditional medicines based on herbal extracts have been proposed as affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Teas and drinks containing extracts of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra have been widely used in Africa in efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and fight COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 16, 2020, states that WHO did not officially recognize artemisia as a treatment for COVID-19, but acknowledged Madagascar's promotion of artemisia-based drinks as a treatment. However, WHO made it clear that scientific evidence is needed for it to be deemed a reliable cure.\n\nInformation 2, although the publication date is not specified, provides a comprehensive review of scientific articles and reports on Artemisia and Artemisia-based products for the management of SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the potential of Artemisia and its derivatives as a potential therapeutic drug for COVID-19, but also notes the lack of scientific evidence to support the anecdotal use of Artemisia extract for COVID-19 management in African countries.\n\nInformation 3, also without a specific publication date, discusses the positive effects of Artemisia species, such as A. annua and A. afra, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related symptoms. It also highlights the potential of artemisinin and its derivatives for drug repurposing and their anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a key role in the development of severe COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 9, 2020, states that the WHO is to test a malaria drug derived from the artemisia plant on COVID-19 patients. The drug, artesunate, is a derivative of artemisinin found in the artemisia plant and has been used for decades to treat malaria. However, the WHO emphasizes that there is currently no evidence that artemisia-derived products are effective in treating COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, without a specific publication date, provides in vitro data on the efficacy of Artemisia extracts against SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the potential of artemisinin derivatives as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn summary, while there is ongoing research and some evidence to suggest the potential of Artemisia and its derivatives as a treatment for COVID-19, there is currently no official recognition by WHO of artemisia as a treatment for COVID-19.

The prison population declined by 157,500 persons during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 study period through the end of August 2020, and by 58,300 in the 6 months through the end of February 2021.\nThe prison population declined by 157,500 persons during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 study period through the end of August 2020, and by 58,300 in the 6 months through the end of February 2021. Twenty-four states released a total of 37,700 persons from prison on an expedited basis (earlier than scheduled) during the COVID-19 study period.\nThis report provides details on the effects of COVID-19 on state and federal prisons from March 2020 to February 2021. The report presents data related to COVID-19 tests, infections, deaths, and vaccinations. It also provides statistics on admissions to and releases, including expedited releases, from state and federal prisons during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-15, is an article that discusses a study finding that COVID-19 cases are five times higher in prisons than in the general population. The study also found that the average daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases during the study period was 8.3% in prisons, compared with 3.4% in the general population.\n\nInformation 4, published on an unknown date, is a research letter published in JAMA that presents similar findings. The study found that the number of U.S. prison residents who tested positive for COVID-19 was 5.5 times higher than the general U.S. population, with a prisoner case rate of 3,251 per 100,000 residents as compared to 587 cases per 100,000 in the general population. After adjusting for age and sex differences between the two groups, the death rate would be three times higher for prisoners compared to the general U.S. population.\n\nThe claim in question, published on 2020-07-15, states that COVID-19 cases are five times higher in prisons than in the general population. This claim is consistent with the findings presented in Information 1 and Information 4, both of which were published on or before the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely true.\n\nIt is worth noting that Information 5, published on an unknown date, states that the number of persons in the custody of state, federal, or privately operated prisons under state or federal contract decreased by more than 16% from the end of February 2020 to the end of February 2021. This information suggests that the prison population may have decreased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have affected the rate of COVID-19 cases in prisons. However, this information does not contradict the claim that COVID-19 cases are five times higher in prisons than in the general population.", "response": "TRUE."}

We asked numerous virologists to explain why that's not true. #TheCube\nThe original claim says that lemon, can \"alkalize the immune system\". So, can ingesting something acidic, like lemon which is below 3 on the pH scale, alter the pH of the body? No, and this is due to a number of reasons. \"The body regulates the pH in a very narrow range, which is important for cell functioning (pH 7.37-7.43),\" Prof. Kann told Euronews. \"When you drink lemon juice with a pH of 2.5 it arrives in the stomach in which you have a pH between 1.5 and 3.5,\" and thus the lemon juice does not alter the already acidic stomach.\nAn example of this is a false claim suggesting a 'cure' for SARS-COV-2 was found in Israel. The post, which we have found not only in English, but also in Spanish and Russian, begins by saying that there are \"no cases\" of coronavirus in Israel. This in itself is untrue, with Israel reporting more than 5,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of 1 April. It then suggests mixing lemon and baking soda with hot tea to \"immediately kill\" the virus, adding that this \"alkalizes the immune system\".\nThere are a number of institutions which have already debunked similar claims to the one outlined above.

The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in.\nLemon juice or lemon water will not protect you against COVID-19. There are so many different types of viruses out there and some viruses actually are more or less susceptible to acidity than others, so you could see why someone might think this could work when it comes to coronavirus.

In this case, it’s seamless merging of fact and fantasy. All of the 19 CEOs in the meme have, in fact, stepped down from their posts. That’s not fake. But their departures had nothing to do with coronavirus, and many took place long before the first COVID-19 cluster was identified.\nAccording to Business Insider, the CEO of the tobacco company Altria, Howard Willard, resigned due to complications from contracting the illness; while the head of SeaWorld recently resigned due to the financial hit the park was taking from having to close down; and there are rumors that Disney head Bob Iger unexpectedly stepped down over a year before his planned retirement because he knew how bad the pandemic would be. And there’s another conspiracy that Q believers have ignored entirely—one that’s already been proven to have come true.\nSo yes, while more CEOs have resigned in the last few years than since the Great Recession, most were in the works long before the coronavirus pandemic hit. They had nothing to do with the actual pandemic—and not the behind-the-scenes war between good and evil that Q believers talk about. The real conspiracies—be it insider trading or that “man of the people” Donald Trump made a great number of rich people more wealthy who are now they are cashing out before things collapse—apparently just isn’t as fun.\nAnd we’re all too distracted by the torrent of pandemic headlines to realize what’s really going on here: Deep state-aligned industry titans are running for the hills before they’re brought down by President Donald Trump and his team of patriots.

Parker will serve as Chairman of the carrier’s board. “It likely would have happened sooner, but the global pandemic — and the devastating impact it had on our industry — delayed those plans,” Parker stated in a note to his employees.\nOn January 20, 2021, Michael Pack, CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media including Voice of America resigned at President Biden’s request, two hours after being sworn in. Often accused for partisanship, Pack pointed fingers at journalists for anti-Trump bias. He initiated investigations into bias claims and tried to sack senior “deep state” executives.\nUnfortunately, many CEO’s are misaligned with corporate objectives. Some make poor or even fatal decisions under stress. Others allow their character flaws to spin out of control. Too many CEO’s sabotage their own best efforts and fail to bring their best selves to the workplace. They can experience untold embarrassment, despair, and untimely resignations.\nSilbermann shared “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see… Bill is a great leader for this transition.” · On June 22, 2022, Jose Mauro Coelho, the CEO of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras stepped down.

This claim was also debunked as false by fact-checkers, who found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the claim made by Cody Harris. It explains that while some of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim were real, they had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or any global conspiracy. Instead, they were due to a variety of factors, including personal health issues and company financial problems.\n\nInformation 5 is not directly related to the claim made by Cody Harris, but it provides some general context about CEO resignations. It notes that some CEOs resign due to poor decision-making, character flaws, or political pressure.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim made by Cody Harris that CEO resignations are linked to a global conspiracy is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and many of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim have been debunked as false.

Slaoui was named to lead the project, working alongside chief operating officer and four-star general Gustave F. Perna. Other candidates for Slaoui's position reportedly included Elias Zerhouni and Arthur Levinson. President Trump described Slaoui as \"one of the most respected men in the world in the production and, really, on the formulation of vaccines\", while Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar praised him as \"arguably the world’s most experienced and successful vaccine developer\".\nOn October 9, 2020 the Wall Street Journal quoted Slaoui as saying that the COVID-19 vaccines would be accompanied by a tracking mechanism provided jointly by McKesson, Google and Oracle. The tracking is capable of monitoring vaccine series uptake, as well as side effects.\nSlaoui is Muslim. He is fluent in Arabic, English, and French.

This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership.\nBut, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence.\nSaudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world’s great faiths.

So far, we are aware of these state officials taking steps to reduce the prison population in the face of the pandemic: The New Jersey legislature passed a bill (S2519) on October 19th, signed shortly after by Governor Phil Murphy, that allowed for people with less than a year left on their sentences to be released up to eight months early.

Existence of a high concentration of inflammatory cytokines and viral load can also lead to numerous pathophysiological conditions. Although it is well established that cancer patients are among the high-risk population due to COVID-19-associated mortality, it is still unknown whether survivors of COVID-19-infected subjects are at high-risk population for developing cancer and whether any biologic and clinical features exist in post-COVID-19 individuals that might be related to carcinogenesis.\nHowever, it is necessary to make plans to manage different health conditions for the post-COVID-19 outbreak time as COVID-19 survivors may develop numerous chronic health hazards including cancer, specifically lung cancer. The onset of pulmonary fibrosis due to COVID-19 infection leads us to speculate one of the worst outcomes of COVID-19 survivors. Induction of cytokine storm may facilitate pulmonary fibrosis development that may reflect the appearance of GGO in the lungs of COVID-19 patients [111,112,113]. The CT findings of GGO may also be correlated with increased expression of ACE2 and need to be analyzed in future studies.\nAlthough it is well established that cancer patients are among the high-risk population due to COVID-19-associated mortality, it is still unknown whether survivors of COVID-19-infected subjects are at high-risk population for developing cancer and whether any biologic and clinical features exist in post-COVID-19 individuals that might be related to carcinogenesis. Keywords: COVID-19, lungs, acute respiratory distress syndrome, ground glass opacity, inflammation · The outbreak of COVID-19 infection was first reported in a Chinese city (Wuhan, Hubei province) and since then, this viral infection has been spreading throughout the world [1] The symptoms of COVID-19 infection were related to the previously known SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and influenza infections, which present with fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, body ache, and dry cough.\nTherefore, survivors of COVID-19 disease may be more prone to several autoimmune disorders, COPD and cancer [38]. The immune system has been reported to be one of the most affected systems in the human by SARS-CoV2 infection [28], and a deregulated immune response may facilitate cancer initiation and progression [37]. A study from China indicates that cancer patients have nearly a four times higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV2 compared to healthy individuals, and the fatality rate is about 30% for cancer patients compared to 3–4% for other subjects [37,39]. A study conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) reported that among 102 lung cancer patients having COVID-19, 62 patients developed severe symptoms, and 25 patients died with aggravated respiratory disorders [40]. Similar studies have also confirmed that lung cancer patients are at high risk in developing severe symptoms due to SARS-CoV2 infection and simultaneous ineffectiveness of the chemotherapeutic re\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-COVID-19 pneumonia lung fibrosis: a worrisome sequelae in ...\nContent:\nBackground Progressive fibrotic lung disease is one of the possible consequences of COVID-19 pulmonary pneumonia, and it is one of the most worrying long-term complications.

Some have persistent lung dysfunction, which shows up on pulmonary function testing. And others still need oxygen up to a year or more after their infection. This form of pulmonary fibrosis isn't progressive. Other patients had COVID-19, but not a severe case.\n\"This can be very frustrating for patients. There could be disease deep in the lungs that the standard lung CT doesn't show.\" \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a very broad term,\" says Dr. Dickinson. \"People fall into different categories after COVID-19 infection.\" People who need intensive care or have had acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, often experience severe lung dysfunction. ARDS can lead to inflammation or fibrosis in the lungs. These COVID-19 survivors tend to have persistent abnormalities on lung imaging six months to a year after their infection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Higher mortality in lung cancer patients with COVID-19? A systematic ...\nContent:\nKeywords: Lung cancer, COVID-19, Mortality, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemic · The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on patients with cancer. Patients with cancer are susceptible to COVID-19 because immunosuppressive treatments can weaken the immune system, and COVID-19 complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanical ventilation, may lead to worse survival.\nIn an observational study conducted in China, most COVID-19 cases had lung cancer (19.6 %) compared with gastrointestinal (18.7 %) and genitourinary (18.7 %) cancers [2]. Other results from a multi-center study in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak indicated that patients with lung cancer or lung metastasis showed a considerably higher risk of death (OR, 2.34; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.15–4.77); P = 0.03), higher ICU admission rates (OR, 2.84; 95 % CI [1.59–5.08]; P < 0.01), and higher risks of other critical events than patients with other cancers without lung metastasis [3]. Another systemic review reported that patients with hematological malignancies (OR, 2.39; 95 % CI, 1.17–4.87); P = 0.02) and lung cancer (OR, 1.83; 95 % CI, (1.00–3.37); P = 0.05] who were infected by COVID-19 had the highest mortality [4]; in contrast, another study by Liang reported that lung patients with lung cancer did not have a higher probability of severe events [5].\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies enrolling patients with COVID-19 and lung cancer, and COVID-19 should have been diagnosed clinically or based on laboratory tests; the diagnosis of lung cancer or other tumors should have had no restriction of pathological type and stage, primary or secondary; (ii) studies reporting mortality rate in patients with lung cancer and COVID-19; (iii) any kind of study (including retrospective studies, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and case series); (iv) studies published in the English language.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Although pulmonary fibrosis can occur in the absence of a clear-cut ...\nContent:\nThe exact mechanism of action of pirfenidone is not known; however, it is thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrotic properties [42]. Neither of these two drugs has demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms or long-term survival benefit [101]. Lung transplantation is the only treatment option with demonstrable increased survival in selected patients with IPF [30]. However, only a few receive this intervention [42]. Chen et al. reported 3 critically ill patients with COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis who had lung transplantation. Two of the patients survived the procedure [79]. Considering the challenges of treating pulmonary fibrosis, there should be greater focus on strategies aimed at reducing the risk among COVID-19 patients.\nTwo of the patients survived the procedure [79]. Considering the challenges of treating pulmonary fibrosis, there should be greater focus on strategies aimed at reducing the risk among COVID-19 patients. These strategies should be targeted at limiting the factors that perpetuate the cycle of lung injury, inflammatory response, and fibroproliferation.\nAlthough these medications have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, further studies are required to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 [106]. With cytokine storm due to hyperinflammation being a major factor implicated in lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of immunosuppressive agents has been widely recommended in the treatment of COVID-19 [27]. Immunosuppressive agents that are currently under consideration include the IL-1 receptor blocker anakinra which has demonstrated improved survival benefits in cytokine storm due to sepsis and IL-6 receptor blocker. Tocilizumab is currently registered for a multicenter clinical trial in COVID-19 patients [107, 108]. Despite the common use of corticosteroids, there is little evidence supporting its clinical benefit [27, 109]. The use of convalescent plasma has shown some promise in clinical trials [110, 111]. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells, having multipotent capacity to replace damaged alveolar epitheli\nFibrosis could be viewed as a consequence of a disordered wound healing process and may be directly related to the severity of an inciting event [4, 5]. Various mechanisms of lung injury in COVID-19 have been described, with both viral and immune-mediated mechanisms being implicated [6]. Apart from these, additional factors could predispose individuals to severe lung injury and lead to an increased risk of mortality or pulmonary fibrosis in survivors. In this review, we discuss the pathological mechanisms involved in the development of fibrosis and explore the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection and review reports of pulmonary fibrosis following previous and current human coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* COVID-19 can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, which is a non-reversible lung dysfunction and one of the possible long-term complications of the disease.\n* The exact mechanism of action of pirfenidone, a drug used to treat pulmonary fibrosis, is not known, but it is thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrotic properties.\n* Lung transplantation is the only treatment option with demonstrable increased survival in selected patients with pulmonary fibrosis.\n* Immunosuppressive agents, such as anakinra and tocilizumab, are under consideration for the treatment of COVID-19, as cytokine storm due to hyperinflammation is a major factor implicated in lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n* The use of corticosteroids has shown little evidence supporting its clinical benefit in the treatment of COVID-19.\n* The development of pulmonary fibrosis is directly related to the severity of the inciting event and various mechanisms of lung injury in COVID-19 have been described, with both viral and immune-mediated mechanisms being implicated.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that the lungs of many patients affected by COVID-19 had become fibrous and their survival rate is lower than that of lung cancer is partially true. The information provided states that COVID-19 can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, which is a non-reversible lung dysfunction and one of the possible long-term complications of the disease. However, it does not provide specific data on the survival rate of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis compared to lung cancer patients.

Suicide prevention strategies must be tailored to better address disparities in youth suicide risk.\nSchool settings can play an important role in suicide prevention by providing age-appropriate programs that reach a large and diverse number of youth. Although the impact of school closures on youth suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear, racial and ethnic disparities in access to in-person instruction have been documented during the pandemic, and the lack of live instruction has been associated with impaired academic progress, decreased physical activity, lower levels of social and emotional support, and greater emotional distress and exposure to in-home conflict.48 Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of school-based suicide prevention programs to increase mental health literacy, enhance awareness about suicide risk, and to decrease the incidence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation.49–51 Opportunities exist to continue adapting these programs to broaden their reach with on-line modes of instruction and delivery.\nA recent US Surgeon General’s Advisory provides further research recommendations to effectively respond to the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of the nation’s youth.58 A Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion–informed framework applied to the study and prevention of youth suicide also offers a promising approach to achieving health equity and reducing suicide risk for all youth.59,60 Examining geographic variations in youth suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic is another important opportunity for future research, and a comparative analysis across subgroups may also shed perspective on this study’s findings.\nFindings highlight the need to identify potential mechanisms underlying differential increases in youth suicide deaths associated with the pandemic and to develop broadened and more effective suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide. Additionally, preteen rates of suicide are increasing warranting further research and clinical attention for this understudied subpopulation at risk. Future research is needed to understand the impact of racial and ethnic disparities62 on emotional and mental health of young people, and to monitor longer-term trends of COVID-19-related suicide morbidity and mortality.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Rethinking Youth Suicide Prevention During COVID - WebMD\nContent:\n<strong>COVID</strong>-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

A research team led by Jeffrey Bridge, Ph.D. , Donna Ruch, Ph.D. , and Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., MPH, analyzed national suicide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers first identified all U.S. youth aged 5 to 24 years with suicide listed as the cause of death over the first 10 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020–December 31, 2020).\nThe significantly higher number of suicide deaths reported for certain racial and ethnic groups, specifically non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black youth, highlights ongoing disparities in rates of suicide that the pandemic may have exacerbated. The increase in suicide deaths among preteens also suggests that more attention may need to be paid to this age group, who tend to be understudied in suicide prevention research and have different developmental needs than older adolescents and young adults.\nThis study shows that the pandemic impacted youth suicide rates, but the impact was not the same for everyone and varied based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity. As such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups.\nAs such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups. Moreover, given the extended duration of the pandemic and its ongoing impact on young people in the United States, it will be important to monitor long-term trends in suicide rates associated with COVID-19 and identify factors driving the increased risk for suicide among some people.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During COVID-19 Pandemic, Especially ...\nContent:\nData suggest depression, anxiety and social isolation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to suicide risk in youth.  · In a study published today in Pediatrics, researchers in the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital found that in the United States, youth suicides increased during COVID-19, with significantly more suicides than expected among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth.\nNational trends in suicides were sourced from the Web-based Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Individuals aged 5-24 years between 2015 and 2020 with suicide listed as the cause of death were included in this analysis. The start of the COVID-19 period was defined as March 2020.  · A total of 5,568 youth living in the United States died by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThis is a group of young people that typically have a very low rate of suicide relative to other young people, and to see an increase in their rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was a cause for concern,” said Donna Ruch, PhD, co-author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Suicide Prevention Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  · The findings of this study highlight the importance of suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide.\n“To our knowledge, no national study examined changes in youth suicide rates that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeffrey A Bridge, PhD, lead author of the study and director of the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “We wanted to a see if there were any changes in the youth suicide rate that occurred and whether these changes happened with the onset of the pandemic.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Suicide spectrum among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: ...\nContent:\nThird, from a wider perspective, the present work calls for urgent investments in the mental health area aimed at offering the young people easy and free access to the services, both in schools and in other public institutions, to enable the early detection of mental disorders and the prevention of the escalation into suicidality. However, literature about youth suicidality during COVID-19 is still expanding and further research is needed to clarify this complex clinical and public health issue.\nAfter the reopenings, we could have assisted to a sort of rebound, in which long-lasting COVID-19 related worries and a potentially hard adaptation to frequent social interactions after months of limitations could have strongly affected the most vulnerable youth's mental health. These findings have great relevance from both a clinical and a public health point of view.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of young people, leading to an increase in suicide rates among certain groups.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.\nYour doctor will suspect COVID-19 if: You have a fever and a cough.

If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies. Researchers are looking at whether the antibodies give you protection against catching it again.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.

Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food? You're much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you're in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nCOVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person. People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection. The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.\nIn general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Controlling Chronic Lung Diseases Amid COVID-19 | American Lung ...\nContent:\nHaving a chronic lung disease means that you can be more likely to get severely ill and have complications from COVID-19.

Even after the disease has passed, lung injury may result in breathing difficulties that might take months to improve.\nAlso, make sure that your chronic health conditions are managed as well as they can be. For example, people living with diabetes, COPD or heart disease should be especially careful to manage those conditions with monitoring and taking their medications as directed.”\nFinally, he stresses, being vaccinated and boosted appropriately at the time of the infection helps ensure the best possible outcome.  “While the vaccine’s immunity makes our immune systems ʻsmarter’ by having a ʻplay book’ to fight off the virus strategically with minimal collateral damage, the vaccine’s immunity may also help in the healing process as well. Abnormal healing is seen often in people who have not previously been vaccinated.\n“As we have learned more about SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19, we have discovered that in severe COVID-19, a significant pro-inflammatory condition can result in several critical diseases, complications and syndromes,” Galiatsatos says.

Concerns were raised that as a large, public gathering held in a confined, indoor space, the rally could exacerbate spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Trump stated that Oklahoma had done \"a great job with COVID\" (despite there having been a recent uptick in cases), while Mayor of Tulsa G. T.

The original scheduling of the rally on June 19 was considered insensitive as it is a day of celebration honoring the emancipation of African Americans, and Tulsa was the site of a race massacre in 1921.

In all iterations, 5G is depicted as either “Satan's strategy” to advance the apocalypse, or the work of a techno-capitalist government cabal that seeks to reduce the population, profit from a vaccine, or embed micro-chips into the vaccine for the purposes of surveillance or control (Wu, 2020).\nWith education and trust shown to be predictors of both conspiracy theory beliefs and public health compliance/confidence, it is ever more essential that the evidence base of such narratives is interrogated (Tomeny et al., 2017; van Prooijen, 2016). Postings asserting the correlation between COVID-19 cases and 5G share some common features (see Appendix 1). They typically contain point data in the form of 5G-carrier tower locations, some with added coverage radii, and choropleth data on COVID-19 (mainly confirmed case and death counts, or case and death rates).\nThey typically contain point data in the form of 5G-carrier tower locations, some with added coverage radii, and choropleth data on COVID-19 (mainly confirmed case and death counts, or case and death rates). The correlation is typically depicted using overlays of point distribution and regional rate data, with COVID data aggregation varying from national (country) to sub-national (i.e. U.S. States). There is little discussion of aggregation issues, or of the comparability between point data (that identify items in location or specific places) and ecological data (that identify some characteristic of a larger area such as a county, local authority area, or electoral division).\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: ‘Corona? 5G? or both?’: the dynamics of COVID-19/5G conspiracy ...\nContent:\nWe hope, however, that the present analysis contributes substantially to that aim by tracing in detail the developments around the nonsensical belief that 5G technology could cause or exacerbate the symptoms of a severe viral infection. 1.Similarly, it has been argued that the myriad conspiracies regarding the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 are so enticing because the official version of events forces us to face the uncomfortable truth that such death and destruction could be caused by 19 men wielding only box-cutters.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic that has spread from its origins in Wuhan, China, around the globe since late 2019 has been accompanied by a similarly global ‘infodemic’, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out (Ghebreyesus, in United Nations, 2020b). This is unsurprising: the outbreak of the mystery disease now generally labelled COVID-19 and its gradual spread through the population necessarily resulted in many uncertainties about the severity and mode of transmission of the virus, about effective protection mechanisms and remedies, about government initiatives to detect the virus and slow its spread and about the longer-term personal, social and economic impacts of the social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures put in place.\nFocussing in detail on one key component of the infodemic surrounding COVID-19, this article traces the dissemination dynamics of rumours that the pandemic outbreak was somehow related to the rollout of 5G mobile telephony technology in Wuhan and around the world. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our analysis shows the dissemination of the rumour on Facebook from its obscure origins in pre-existing conspiracist groups through greater uptake in more diverse communities to substantial amplification by celebrities, sports stars and media outlets.\nThe rumour also builds upon a series of related narratives regarding the possible health and environmental impacts of 5G technology, and arguably flourished in large part thanks to the pre-existing networks and misinformation surrounding it. These rumours fit very strongly into the category of ‘conspiracy theory’, which itself arguably forms a separate subset of the mis- and disinformation categories noted above.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-09\nTitle: Here’s where those 5G and coronavirus conspiracy theories came ...\nContent:\nWhen hundreds of starlings were found dead in a road in North Wales in December 2019, those vocal in the anti-5G community made the same accusations.

It wasn’t just birds.\nIn reality, mass deaths of birds aren’t uncommon (and predate 5G technology) and the UK government monitors them to check for disease outbreaks. It wasn’t just birds. The claims that 5G was dangerous to human health was also backed up by supposed examples of harm to trees.\nBut one thing that it’s important to realise is that there isn’t one single “5G conspiracy theory”. Instead, there are multiple theories, which sometimes overlap, but can also contradict each other. Look at some of the larger anti-5G groups on Facebook, and you can find these claims sitting alongside each other: that the virus is the real cause of the disease, but 5G is making it worse, that the virus is not the cause of the disease and all the symptoms are actually caused by 5G, and that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown.\nFor this faction, 5G wasn’t causing Covid-19 symptoms, it was now being used by the government as a distraction, so 5G could be installed across the country without delay. Some claim the virus was made in a laboratory, or that it was a completely different disease, or that there was in fact no outbreak at all.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nZignal Labs, an impact intelligence platform that studies online discourse, identified a Twitter account that on January 19 tweeted, “Wuhan has 5,000+ #5G base stations now and 50,000 by 2021 — is it a disease or 5G?” while retweeting a Russia Today article about a new, flu-like virus in China. Although the post got little engagement, it’s a sign that the theory had already been spreading to some degree.\nThe first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak. Three months later, conspiracy theorists making similar claims were setting cellphone towers on fire in Europe. Gregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread.\nGregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread. Two days after the French blog post, a Belgian newspaper called Het Laatste Nieuws published an interview with a local doctor, who floated the unfounded claim that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to 5G cellphone towers installed near Wuhan in 2019.\nOthers float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n1. In early January 2020, social media users started linking 5G and COVID-19, claiming that 5G either causes or accelerates the spread of the virus. This conspiracy theory has been debunked by fact-checkers and health officials.\n2. Some people claim that 5G was first tested in Wuhan, China, where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported, suggesting a connection between the two. Others claim that previous mobile network technologies (3G and 4G) caused SARS and Swine flu.\n3. Social media posts claiming a correlation between 5G and COVID-19 typically contain point data for 5G tower locations and choropleth data for COVID-19 cases or death rates. These posts often lack discussion of data aggregation issues and the differences between point and ecological data.\n4. The conspiracy theory has spread globally, with anti-5G groups and individuals claiming that 5G is causing or exacerbating COVID-19 symptoms, or that the virus is a hoax to enable 5G installation.\n5. The conspiracy theory has been linked to a French conspiracy website and a Belgian newspaper, which published unfounded claims about a connection between 5G and COVID-19.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that 5G is causing disease and deaths is FALSE. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by health officials and fact-checkers. The theory has spread on social media, with various claims about a connection between 5G and COVID-19, but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.

A LNP contain an ionizable lipid, a stabilizing agent for stability, a phospholipid to stabilize the bilayer and PEG. The ionizable lipid allows self-assembly, increase the encapsulation of mRNA and helps to escape from endosomes. The PEG minimizes LNPs' nonspecific binding to proteins, increases circulation time in blood and helps to avoid RES uptake [50,51]. BNT162b2 is a lipid NP-formulated nucleotide-modified RNA vaccine which encodes a membrane anchored, perfusion stabilized full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [63]. The phase I/II trials showed that the vaccine was well tolerated in young (18–55 years of age) and older (65–85 years of age) adults [64]. The participant groups received two doses at a dose level of 10, 20 and 30 μg with a 21-day interval between the two doses.\nFurther, the interaction between the neutral lipids and the blood cell membranes is less, hence improve the LNPs’ biocompatibility [44]. At low pH, the ionizable lipid becomes positively charged as they are protonated which enables RNA complexation. The PEGylated lipid reduces opsonization process hence avoid uptake by phagocytes and increase their circulation time in blood. Cholesterol and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) help to incorporate the drug into the LNPs [37,63,71,72]. The molar ratios of the positively charged lipid:PEGylated lipid:cholesterol:DSPC are 46.3:1.6:42.7:9.4 and 50:1.5:38.5:10 for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines respectively [37,73]. Before administration, BNT162b2 requires thawing and subsequent dilution with saline solution, but mRNA-1273, after thawing, could be administered directly as it is without further dilution with saline solution.\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have great potential to deliver nucleic acids including mRNAs. The two mRNA-based vaccines namely the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) have been given emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US-FDA to prevent SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 and the vaccines were developed using LNPs.\nTherefore, many vaccines have been developed and their safety and efficacy have been evaluated in clinical trials and several vaccines got EUA and many are in clinical trials. Nucleic acids have been emerging as potential drugs to treat a variety of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been studied extensively to deliver a wide range of drugs including vaccines.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery | Nature Reviews Materials\nContent:\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a new category of therapeutic agent to prevent and treat various diseases. To function in vivo, mRNA requires safe, effective and stable delivery systems that protect the nucleic acid from degradation and that allow cellular uptake and mRNA release. Lipid nanoparticles have successfully entered the clinic for the delivery of mRNA; in particular, lipid nanoparticle–mRNA vaccines are now in clinical use against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which marks a milestone for mRNA therapeutics.\nOther COVID-19 vaccines based on lipid nanoparticle–mRNA formulations are also under evaluation in different clinical phases (Table 1). In preclinical studies, some vaccine candidates showed protective effects by delivering self-amplifying RNA encoding the spike protein40,186,187 (Box 2), a cocktail of mRNAs encoding three viral proteins74, modified mRNA encoding the receptor-binding domain188 or spike mRNA with engineered untranslated regions107.

When the LNP is inside the acidic endosome (middle), the ionizable lipids become positively charged and help release the LNP and mRNA into the cell's cytoplasm.\nBy 2005, the development of better and safer LNPs was driven by excitement for a new technology, called small interfering RNA (siRNA), for selectively silencing genes. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which became the leading siRNA company, quickly realized that existing nanoparticles were not very good at helping siRNA get into cells. The company struck multiple partnerships to make new LNPs, including with Protiva in 2005 and Inex in 2006. The groups made more than 300 ionizable lipids, first optimizing the fatty tails, then tweaking the ionizable head group and the linker region in between.\nThe endosome’s acidic interior protonates the heads of the ionizable lipids, making them positively charged. That positive charge triggers a change in the shape of the nanoparticle, which scientists think helps it break free from the endosome and ultimately release its RNA cargo into the cell’s cytoplasm.\nA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) contains hundreds of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, each surrounded by ionizable lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol.

Most of the diseases listed in the claim were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years. While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons. However, the evidence shows that most of the diseases listed in the claim had little to no impact on U.S. elections and were not directly linked to election years.", "response": "FALSE."}

And if it happens remotely, it will be inadequate, isolating and unable to provide the child care many working parents need. Desperate for a better solution, parents around the country have started organizing “pandemic pods,” or home schooling pods, for the fall, in which groups of three to 10 students learn together in homes under the tutelage of the children’s parents or a hired teacher.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (Publication date: 2013-08-06): This information is not related to the claim as it provides general information about COVID-19 and does not mention anything about parents turning to \"pods\" for school during the pandemic.\n\nInformation 2 (Publication date: 2020-09-28): This information describes how parents in West Philadelphia formed a pod to help their children with virtual schooling during the pandemic. They reached out to a tutoring service called Mainline Tutoring Collaborative to connect with private tutors. The pod consists of five families, and they take turns hosting the \"school\" at their homes.\n\nInformation 3 (Publication date: 2021-03-24): This information discusses the rise of pandemic learning pods, also known as microschools or pandemic homeschooling pods, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A San Francisco parent started a Facebook group called \"Pandemic Pods\" in July, which now has almost 40,000 members. The pods aim to provide structure, stability, and socialization within a smaller cohort of students to reduce COVID-19 exposure risk.\n\nInformation 4 (Publication date: None): This information is a list of resources and links related to pandemic pods, including articles, FAQs, and health guidelines.\n\nInformation 5 (Publication date: 2020-08-18): This information discusses how parents have started organizing \"pandemic pods\" or home schooling pods for the fall during the pandemic. These pods consist of groups of three to 10 students who learn together in homes under the tutelage of the children's parents or a hired teacher.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is: TRUE.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim states that \"Parents Turn to 'Pods' for School During Pandemic.\" Information 2, 3, and 5 all support this claim by providing examples of parents who have formed pods for their children's schooling during the pandemic. Information 2 specifically mentions the formation of a pod in West Philadelphia, which is consistent with the location mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the available information.", "response": "TRUE."}

On 10 August 2022, IEBC announced that 14 million Kenyans, who were identified electronically, had voted bringing the total percentage to 65.4%.\nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced plans to roll out the first phase of a 30-day mass voter registration exercise beginning 4 October 2021. The exercise targeted between 6 and 7 million new voters. However, with the home stretch of voter registration approaching, the commission raised concerns over its failure to reach its target.\nIEBC registered all aspirants expected to run for the various elective seats between 29 May and 7 June 2022. William Ruto and Raila Odinga were cleared on 4 and 5 June respectively, in an event that would see them present their nomination papers.\nSonko filed a petition at the High Court to have it compel IEBC to clear him for the gubernatorial race. On 13 July 2022, the court noted in its ruling that Sonko's impeachment case was yet to be determined by the Supreme Court, and ordered the electoral commission to clear Sonko to vie for the Mombasa governorship.\nGeneral elections were held in Kenya on Tuesday, 9 August 2022. Voters elected the president, governors, senators, members of the National Assembly, and members of county assemblies. This was the third general election and the fourth presidential one since the promulgation of the 2010 constitution.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission\nContent:\n<strong>IEBC</strong> - Independent <strong>Electoral</strong> and Boundaries <strong>Commission</strong>\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2022-09-19\nTitle: Seven Takeaways from Kenya’s Consequential Election – Africa ...\nContent:\nIts parallel vote tabulation (PVT) produced almost similar results to that of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) with a margin of error of between 0.1 and 2.1 percent. ELOG deployed 5,000 observers in all 47 counties, covering 47,000 polling stations. An additional 1,000 PVT monitors crunched incoming data from the IEBC portal in real time. Complementing the PVT, for the first time in Kenya—and possibly Africa—IEBC data released from the polling stations was accessible to the public. This allowed Kenyan media to run their own tallies and release provisional results 72 hours before the IEBC.\nThis overturned the practice of vesting sweeping powers in the IEBC Chair to alone “confirm, alter, vary, and/or verify the presidential election results.” The Kiai Petition was upheld in its entirely in August 2017 by the Court of Appeals, Kenya’s highest court, rejecting a government appeal. The Supreme Court decision to overturn the 2017 elections was based on this petition. While doubts over the autonomy of Kenya’s judiciary persist, with many Kenyans saying at least some of the country’s judges are corrupt, Kenya’s upper courts have painstakingly established institutional traditions of independence irrespective of their composition.\nThis allowed Kenyan media to run their own tallies and release provisional results 72 hours before the IEBC. Armed with this data, they also provided 24-hour analysis of the polls, setting a new norm worth emulating. The steady stream of data allowed the political parties, civil society organizations, and ordinary citizens to concurrently track the unfolding results.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-08-08\nTitle: In Kenya’s 2022 Elections, Technology and Data Protection Must ...\nContent:\nThis has enabled the deployment of the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System (KIEMS), which comprises the Biometric Voter Registration, the Electronic Voter Identification, and the Results Transmission System during tallying in Kenyan elections.

The study does not directly attribute the deaths to covid-19. Instead, excess mortality refers to the overall rate of deaths exceeding what would be expected from historical trends.\nThe changing profile of U.S. covid-19 deaths · The study examined the deaths of 538,139 people 25 years and older in Florida and Ohio, between January 2018 and December 2021, with researchers linking them to party registration records. Researchers found the excess death rate for Republicans and Democrats was about the same at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\n“We’re not saying that if you took someone’s political party affiliation and were to change it from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party that they would be more likely to die from covid-19,” Wallace said. Researchers also pointed out that more than 50 million Americans have yet to get an initial coronavirus vaccine, and reasons often extend “beyond political beliefs or party affiliation alone.” Surveys have shown Republicans lagged in vaccination rates, including for booster shots. KFF estimated that between June 2021 and March 2022, at least 234,000 covid-19 deaths could have been prevented if people had received a primary series of vaccinations.\nOpinionsYour questions about covid-19, answered by Dr. Leana Wen · HealthWhat to know about fall flu, coronavirus and RSV vaccines for kids · HealthFederal government to start providing free coronavirus tests once again · OpinionsShould I get the new covid booster?

The researchers estimated excess mortality based on how the overall rate of deaths during the pandemic compared to what would have been expected from historical, pre-pandemic trends. As they calculated excess death rate data for Florida and Ohio, the researchers found only small differences between Republican and Democratic voters in the first year of the pandemic, with both groups suffering similarly sharp rises in excess deaths that winter.\nIn late 2021, an NPR analysis found that after May of that year — a timeframe that overlaps the vaccine availability cited in the new study — people in counties that voted strongly for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election were \"nearly three times as likely to die from COVID-19\" as people in pro-Biden counties. \"An unvaccinated person is three times as likely to lean Republican as they are to lean Democrat,\" as Liz Hamel, vice president of public opinion and survey research at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told NPR. Even before vaccines were widely accessible, researchers were working to quantify the effects of vastly divergent COVID-19 policies across U.S. states.\nRepublicans' excess death rate spiked after COVID-19 vaccines arrived: study After vaccines became widely available in 2021, \"the excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters,\" Yale researchers say.\nThe pandemic inflicted higher rates of excess deaths on both Republicans and Democrats.

The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 didn’t even exist until late 2019, and didn’t arrive in the US until January.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-06\nTitle: Trump makes false claims about COVID-19 testing | Fact Check\nContent:\nTrump also claimed during the meeting that “the last administration left us nothing” and that “we started off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests.” · He repeated this claim when pressed by a journalist on how this could be true since the virus is new, saying: “We had tests that were obsolete. We had tests that didn’t take care of people.” · But the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 “were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,” according to the World Health Organization. Obama left office in January 2017.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 1, 2020, confirms that U.S. President Donald Trump did imply that the Obama administration left behind \"bad,\" \"broken,\" and \"obsolete\" COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This information supports the claim made on the same date.\n\nHowever, other sources provide context that contradicts the claim. Information 2, published on March 13, 2020, states that President Trump had previously falsely claimed that an Obama-era Food and Drug Administration \"rule\" prevented his administration from providing diagnostic tests to the American people more quickly. This information suggests that Trump's more recent claims about faulty tests left by the Obama administration are untrue.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 5, 2020, points out that COVID-19 did not exist when Trump took office in January 2017, which makes it implausible that the Obama administration could have left behind faulty tests for this specific disease.\n\nInformation 4 and 5, both published in April and May 2020, also challenge Trump's claims. They highlight the absurdity of blaming the Obama administration for testing problems related to a virus that did not exist during Obama's tenure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is accurate in that Trump did imply the Obama administration left behind faulty COVID-19 tests, other available information contradicts this claim. Given that the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it is unlikely that the Obama administration could have left behind faulty tests for this specific disease.

Because of its link with the horrors of World War II and the use of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps for medical experimentation, debate continues today about the authority of the Code, its applicability to modern medical research, and even its authorship.1,2,4,5,8 The chief prosecutor at the Doctors' Trial, General Telford Taylor, believed that one of the three U.S. judges, Harold Sebring, was the author of the Code.2 Two American physicians who helped prosecute the Nazi doctors at Nuremberg, Leo Alexander and Andrew Ivy, hav\nOn June 12, 1947, Ivy came to Nuremberg for the third time, this time to testify in rebuttal for the prosecution. His testimony, the longest of the trial, lasted four days.12 · In direct examination, Ivy presented to the judges three research principles that he had formulated at the request of the American Medical Association and which, he said, reflected common research practices.12 His document entitled “Principles of Ethics Concerning Experimentation with Human Beings,” adopted by the American Medical Association House of Delegates in December 1946, read in part:\nHe declared that “[t]here is no justification in killing five people in order to save the lives of five hundred” and that “no state or politician under the sun could force [him] to perform a medical experiment which [he] thought was morally unjustified.”12 Ivy also stressed that the state may not assume the moral responsibility of physicians to their patients or research subjects, arguing that “[E]very physician should be acquainted with the Hippocratic Oath [which] represents the Golden Rule of the medical profession in the United States, and, to [his] knowledge, throughout the world.”12 When, finally, defense counsel asked Ivy to reconcile the Hippocratic moral maxim that forbids physicians to “administer a poison to anyone even when asked to do so” with conducting potentially lethal experimental interventions on volunteer subjects, Ivy replied, “I believe this Hippocratic commandment refers to the function of the physician as a therapist, not as an experimentalist, and what refers t\nIn the Nuremberg Code, the judges gave the subject as much authority as the physician-researcher to end the experiment before its conclusion (principle 9).

According to Information 1, Doria announced that the state would not prescribe hydroxychloroquine to patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms if the federal government established the measure. However, the claim does not specify whether it refers to all COVID-19 patients or only those with mild symptoms. The claim also does not specify whether Doria forbade doctors to prescribe chloroquine or if he only forbade its use in certain situations.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is generally consistent with Information 1, it lacks sufficient specificity to be classified as entirely true. Additionally, there is no direct evidence in the provided information that Doria forbade doctors to give chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.

A: It’s complicated. Coronaviruses do not transmit strictly through sex, and the particular one that causes COVID-19, mainly spreads from droplets produced when infected people cough, sneeze or speak, which are inhaled by people nearby. But all forms of in-person sexual contact carry a risk for viral spread because the virus is readily transmitted by aerosols and fomites.\nQ: What are some basic precautions you can take before having sex? A: With access to birth control pills becoming more difficult for some people and others having difficulty refilling orders during shelter-in-place orders, public health experts say that it’s more important than ever to use condoms to prevent unplanned pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\nA: With access to birth control pills becoming more difficult for some people and others having difficulty refilling orders during shelter-in-place orders, public health experts say that it’s more important than ever to use condoms to prevent unplanned pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

This means they first develop in animals before being transmitted to humans. (Older coronaviruses like the common cold have been in human populations for so long that these days they are more commonly transmitted from one human to another.)\nFor the virus to be transmitted from animals to humans, a person has to come into close contact with an animal that has the infection. Once the virus develops in people, coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets. This is a technical name for the wet stuff that moves through the air when you exhale, cough, sneeze, or talk.\nThe 2019 coronavirus hasn’t been definitively linked to a specific animal. Researchers believe that the virus may have been passed from bats to another animal — either snakes or pangolins — and then transmitted to humans.\nThis is not the first time a coronavirus has made news.

However, this can’t be true as nanoparticles cannot be seen with the naked eye. Some research has been done about whether nanoparticles could be used to develop more efficient Covid-19 tests, but they are not part of the swab used in PCR tests.\nA sample is taken on a swab and when it reaches a laboratory, a solution is added to it and, if the virus is present, that solution creates billions of copies of the RNA so that it can be detected and produce a positive result. PCR tests do not insert nanoparticles or anything else into the human body besides the swab itself.\nPCR tests insert nanoparticles into your brain and cause Morgellons disease. This is entirely false. There is no evidence PCR tests insert anything into your brain, and there is debate about whether Morgellons is a real disease.\nIn the video, a British man claims “they are definitely putting something in the PCR tests” and shows viewers another video featuring an American woman holding what appear to be synthetic fibres in a pair of tweezers.

PCR was invented in 1983 by American biochemist Kary Mullis at Cetus Corporation. Mullis and biochemist Michael Smith, who had developed other essential ways of manipulating DNA, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.\nPCR is fundamental to many of the procedures used in genetic testing and research, including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes.\nUsing PCR, copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes.

This is especially true of N95 respirators for providers and even of surgical masks to be utilized by everyone. In some locations, the shortage is critical, forcing the providers to work under unsafe conditions. In part because of the shortage, the cost of PPE is high. Many hospitals are having difficulty paying for PPE.\nThere are many disputes between providers and hospitals regarding what is appropriate PPE in each setting. Many hospitals are requiring providers to reuse their own PPE that may no longer be sterile or protective. Some hospitals that do not provide adequate PPE still restrict the providers from using PPE they own and bring to the hospital.\nAlthough some providers have lived apart from their families, it is recommended that providers continue to stay at home with their families [33-35]. This preserves everyone’s mental health. Providers should carefully follow standard precautions including utilization of appropriate PPE at work and washing hands as indicated. On arriving home they may change clothes. They should avoid sharing utensils and items of personal use.\nAccording to unpublished accounts, as of 23rd April 2020, more than 21,800 U.S. providers had contracted COVID-19 and 71 had died. This very high risk causes psychological distress among the providers [5]. It is especially so among younger and more junior workers and those with dependent children [5]. Risk factors for providers contracting COVID-19 include inadequate handwashing, inadequate or improper use of PPE, and prolonged work hours and exposure [6].

Equally worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death3 partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.4\nThe situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million.1 The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilator\n\nInformation 1, published around May-July 2020, discusses the factors contributing to the PPE shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The post started circulating after Dennis Archer Jr. posted a photo following Joe Biden’s visit to Michigan last week. The photo posted showed Archer shaking hands with Biden, with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in the background.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim is that Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer were maskless at the Detroit Athletic Club while children are mandated to wear masks while playing outdoor sports.\n* The photo of Biden and Whitmer without masks was taken in March, before the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in Michigan and before masks were recommended by public health officials.\n* The photo was taken at a fundraising event on March 9, and both Biden and Whitmer have since been seen wearing masks in public.\n* Social media users have been widely circulating photos of Biden shaking hands with former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer Jr. without a face mask, with Whitmer and Duggan appearing in the background of the photo.\n* The posts call Biden, Whitmer and Duggan hypocrites for encouraging Americans to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic while ignoring their own advice.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim is that Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer were maskless at the Detroit Athletic Club while children are mandated to wear masks while playing outdoor sports. The information provided shows that the photo of Biden and Whitmer without masks was taken in March, before the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in Michigan and before masks were recommended by public health officials. Therefore, the claim is false as it is based on an outdated photo and does not take into account the current guidelines and regulations regarding mask-wearing.\n\nAdditionally, the information shows that social media users have been widely circulating photos of Biden shaking hands with former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer Jr. without a face mask, with Whitmer and Duggan appearing in the background of the photo. These posts call Biden, Whitmer and Duggan hypocrites for encouraging Americans to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic while ignoring their own advice. However, these photos are also from the same fundraising event in March, and therefore, the claim is still false.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the claim is false as the photo of Biden and Whitmer without masks is from March, before masks were recommended by public health officials, and both Biden and Whitmer have since been seen wearing masks in public.", "response": "FALSE."}

Surely you *want* Chinese people to wear face masks, not put them off wearing them.\nHaving those masks with the Taiwanese flag on them to make a political point. Essentially makes it impossible for a Chinese person to wear them for political reasons or not. Even if a Chinese person supports Taiwan's independence or have no opinion either way, they wouldn't wear the mask in fear of their own Government.\nThere is literally nothing immoral about Taiwan placing its own flag on its own products. ... I love this so much. ... While good for a meme, I don't think these are the masks needed for the infection: Those look like normal scooter masks, or the ones people were also wearing during the demonstrations. Not surgical masks, with multiple layers with different purposes. So...cute, but not really. ... Childish provocation. ... Not like Taiwanese people would ever want to wear a face mask with their own flag or maybe tourists.\nThere was actually a post in this sub days just this week that an HKer in Korea sent face masks to HK but was rerouted to China. I don't know if that is exactly what happened but it should be close to that. I believe that it won't inhibit though. Why? I doubt that it would be allowed in HK. ... Won't work.

Wearing a face mask with the Taiwan flag on it would be extremely humiliating and embarrassing for any Chinese national as Taiwan and China have always been at loggerheads with each other.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (2020-02-01): Masks with the Taiwanese flag were in production since 2019 and are not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The masks are unlikely to deter Chinese people from buying them, as it would not be an issue for Chinese citizens to wear masks with the Taiwanese flag.\n\nInformation 2 (2020-02-01): A Reddit post discussing the masks with the Taiwanese flag. Users mention that it is a childish provocation, not a solution to prevent Chinese people from buying masks. It is also pointed out that these masks are not suitable for preventing the virus.\n\nInformation 3 (2020-02-03): An article discussing the masks with the Taiwanese flag becoming a hot item to fend off Chinese buyers. The masks first appeared on social media platforms, including Twitter and Reddit, with the claim that they would prevent Chinese people from buying them due to the presence of the Taiwanese flag.\n\nInformation 4 (No date): A forum post asking why Taiwan's mask makers print the Taiwan flag on the face masks. The answer suggests that it is due to good intentions but may not be well thought out.\n\nInformation 5 (2020-02-07): An article claiming that Taiwan sells face masks with the national flag printed on them to deter Chinese buyers. The article states that wearing a mask with the Taiwan flag would be humiliating and embarrassing for Chinese nationals.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the Taiwanese flag is printed on masks to prevent the Chinese from buying them is false. The information provided demonstrates that the masks with the Taiwanese flag were in production before the COVID-19 pandemic and are not designed to prevent Chinese people from buying them. Instead, it appears to be a childish provocation, as mentioned in Information 2.\n\nMoreover, Information 5 states that Taiwan sells face masks with the national flag printed on them to deter Chinese buyers. However, this information is not accurate, as the masks were already in production before the COVID-19 pandemic, as mentioned in Information 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false, and the content described in the claim is incorrect.", "response": "FALSE."}

Additionally, there is no evidence provided in the claim to support this assertion.\n\nThe claim that walking in the mountains is forbidden and that masks force the body to leave without oxygen is also debunked by Information 1. These statements are false and lack any supporting evidence.\n\nInformation 2, 4, and 5 all support the idea that masks do not significantly affect oxygen intake or breathing. Information 2 explains that many people breathe in ways that compromise their well-being even without masks, and Information 4 explicitly states that masks do not reduce oxygen intake or increase CO2 levels. Information 5 focuses on exercising outdoors with a mask, but it does not provide any evidence that masks affect oxygen levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that COVID-19 tests are for DNA sampling and cloning, and that masks and other measures related to the pandemic are satanic or harmful is false.

Today, the emerging evidence based on experience from other viral infections and new studies suggest that overweight and obesity seem to be risk factors for worse outcomes in those who are infected by COVID-19.\nFor further information with regards to the link between Obesity/NCDs and the current outbreak of COVID-19, explore World Obesity’s policy dossier. We are collating known evidence, resources and materials pertaining to Obesity/NCDs and the current outbreak of COVID-19.\nObesity and COVID-19 Statement from our policy team - Updated August 2020.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-10-17, provides CDC data stating that obesity increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including hospitalization and ICU admission, especially among racial and ethnic minority groups. \n\nInformation 2, though no publication date is available, states that 78% of U.S. patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were overweight or obese, and children with obesity are more likely to experience severe outcomes.\n\nInformation 3, also without a publication date, cites the World Health Organization and the World Obesity Federation supporting the association between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes. It also mentions ongoing research into the biological mechanisms linking obesity and COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-06, supports the claim that obesity is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and complications, independent of other illnesses.\n\nInformation 5 does not have a publication date, but it highlights the World Health Organization's recognition of NCDs, including obesity, as a risk factor for severe COVID-19.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-05-06, states that it provides the latest evidence on obesity and COVID-19. The available information supports the claim that obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, more recent studies (Information 1, 2, and 3) provide additional evidence not available at the time of the claim's publication. Considering the timeline, the claim was accurate at the time it was made, but more recent evidence supports the link between obesity and COVID-19 even more strongly. Therefore, the claim is generally true, but it should be noted that more evidence has emerged since its publication.", "response": "TRUE."}

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective. Figures from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland show that people admitted with covid-19 after 1 September were about 10 per cent less likely to die than those admitted before then. 16% Estimated coronavirus infection fatality rate for people over 90\nThe best way to work out how many people have been infected is to test the blood of thousands of people to see how many have antibodies to the coronavirus, and then extrapolate the results to entire countries.

Since then, the prevalence of cumulative COVID-19 cases has been greater in nonmetro areas, although beginning in April 2021, the prevalence of cumulative COVID-19 cases has been very similar in metro and nonmetro areas. The rate of increase of cumulative COVID-19 cases peaked in early January 2021 and has since declined in both metro and nonmetro areas.\nChanges in employment compared to the levels seen prior to the pandemic are inversely related to changes in the unemployment rate. However, because labor force participation has declined, percent employment changes show less recovery than changes in the unemployment rate. For example, although the unemployment rate in nonmetro areas had declined almost to the pre-pandemic level by November 2020, employment in nonmetro areas remained 2.6 percent below the nonmetro employment level from 24 months earlier.\nRecent county-level evidence on the prevalence of COVID-19 and local unemployment and employment rates, while no means a complete picture, provides indication of the spread of the virus and ensuing economic recession across the United States (see the note on data sources). The analysis of COVID-19 prevalence presented below focuses on cumulative COVID-19 case rates and not on recent or active cases. COVID-19 has spread to nearly every nation in the world, and to every State and inhabited county in the United States. The virus initially spread most rapidly to large metro areas, and most confirmed cases have been in metro areas with populations of at least 1 million.\nThe rate of increase of cumulative COVID-19 cases peaked in early January 2021 and has since declined in both metro and nonmetro areas. ... By June 7, 2021, the regions with the highest prevalence of cumulative COVID-19 cases included much of the Midwest and South regions and parts of the Mountain region of the western United States.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Rural-Urban Variation in COVID-19 Experiences and Impacts among U.S.\nContent:\nMany of the rural hospitals that are available had less capacity to deal with surges in cases, limited medical personnel, and less access to ventilators and personal protective equipment for health care providers. COVID-19 testing rates were also lower in rural areas (Monnat 2020; Souch and Cossman 2021), increasing risk of community spread. These factors may all have secondary effects on physical and psychological health.\nLabor shortages have already prompted wage increases that benefit workers. To the extent that these changes vary geographically, we should also expect to see geographic differences in physical and mental health outcomes and financial well-being. Researchers should continue to explore geographic differences in these longer-term outcomes, including along the rural-urban continuum and between different types of rural communities.\nGovernment-deemed essential industries like meatpacking, agriculture, and prisons are disproportionately located in rural areas, placing rural workers at increased risk of infections, even as they continued to earn paychecks (Hooks and Sawyer 2020; Peters 2020; Taylor, Boulos, and Almond 2020). Rural populations are also sicker than urban populations.\nResidents of rural counties adjacent to metro areas reported the worst outcomes: they were more likely than residents of large urban counties to report positive tests for coronavirus; to live with someone who tested positive or have a close friend or family member outside of the household test positive; to have a close friend or family member hospitalized; to seek treatment for anxiety or depression; to be late paying rent, mortgage, and other bills; to not be able to afford groceries or other necessities; and to get a loan from family or friends.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-29\nTitle: U.S. Rural Areas Also See COVID-19 Increases\nContent:\nOverall, rural counties in the U.S. saw a record number of new COVID-19 cases for a second week in a row, according to The Daily Yonder in Knoxville, Tennessee. Between June 17-24, rural counties recorded more than 23,000 new cases. The week before, rural counties reported more than 19,000 cases. In Wisconsin, Marathon County marked its highest weekly increase this week since cases started to climb at the beginning of June, according to WSAW. “We’re seeing transmission happen faster than ever before in our pandemic,” Judy Burrows, a spokeswoman for the Marathon County Health Department, told the news station.\nRural counties in states with record highs are also increasing, including areas in Arkansas, California, Florida, Missouri and Texas that doubled during the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Lassen County, California, and Hot Spring County, Arkansas, large spikes were linked to outbreaks in prisons, the AP reported. In McDonald County, Missouri, cases tripled when Tyson Foods tested employees at a chicken plant. Overall, rural counties in the U.S. saw a record number of new COVID-19 cases for a second week in a row, according to The Daily Yonder in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nJune 29, 2020 -- As states in the South and West, such as Arizona, Texas, and Florida set daily records for new coronavirus cases, rural towns are recording higher numbers as well, according to the Associated Press. At the beginning of the pandemic, New York City and other large urban areas emerged as hotspots due to the large populations and frequent interactions between people that enabled the coronavirus to spread easily. Now states such as Kansas, Idaho and Oklahoma are seeing increases.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, New York City and other large urban areas emerged as hotspots due to the large populations and frequent interactions between people that enabled the coronavirus to spread easily. Now states such as Kansas, Idaho and Oklahoma are seeing increases. The numbers are still low, but they are climbing higher, the news outlet reported. In early June, the seven-day average in Kansas was about 96 per day. Now it has doubled. Also in early June, the seven-day average for Oklahoma was around 81 per day.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in urban and rural areas in the ...\nContent:\nIn addition, 16.4 million people live in rural areas with no medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) beds[7]. Rural residents have a shorter life expectancy than urban residents and rural households also report a lower median income[8]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), older people are at the highest risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality[9]. In the 2016 U.S. Census, the median age of rural area residents was 51 years, whereas the median age in urban areas was 45[10]. Rural communities also have a larger proportion of residents 65 years and older (18.4% compared to 14.5%)[8]. The proportion of older adults is increasing more quickly in rural communities due to declining birth rates and migration patterns in younger adults[11].\nWhen making public health policies, the local government should be aware of, and consider, the differences in COVID-19 spread between urban and rural areas, which will allow more effective disease control. With increasing incidence rates in rural areas, residents must be made aware of their increased risk of infection so they can take personal measures to protect themselves, and Critical Access Hospitals must continue to receive Federal funding, as they are crucial to treating patients in rural areas. Health partnerships must also be made to coordinate data and updates about COVID-19, and to share valuable resources, such as personal protective equipment.\nFrom the beginning of May to mid-November 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has steadily increased, whereas the rate of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and mortality has declined[1]. However, there is substantial spatial and temporal variation in the dynamics of the epidemic within the U.S.[2], [3], [4], with New York, New Jersey and Maryland experiencing the highest burden of the infection early in the epidemic.\nInterventions were eased during the second time interval from June 16 to August 29, while the third interval from August 30 to November 12 corresponded to the surge of the third wave of the epidemic in the U.S. To illustrate temporal changes in both COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, we generated choropleth maps at the county level to compare rates in each period. We also categorized states into two groups based on incidence rates.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Progression of COVID‐19 From Urban to Rural Areas in the United ...\nContent:\nThe parameter ρ captures how the process evolves with time; a positive value indicates an increase over time. The term ε(t) is a zero‐mean spatially correlated Gaussian process with covariance matrix Σ that is characterized by exponential covariance function using geodesic distances between county centroids (see Chapters 2 and 3 of Ref.\nWe fitted our model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (see Ref. 23) using R/RStudio version 3.6.3, 24 , 25 and spate, spTimer packages. 21 , 26 , 27 The effects of county‐level independent variables were assessed using 95% credible intervals (CrI). Finally, we computed percent changes in daily prevalence from the fitted prevalence curves and evaluated whether it significantly increased or decreased using a linear trend equation of time and t‐statistics.\nThese percentages increased to 98% urban and 84% rural counties within 5 weeks. Based on median estimates, in urban counties, about 37.8% of the population was between 25 and 49 years as compared to 35% in rural counties (P < .0001). Most of the rural population were white, obese, and smokers as compared to urban counterparts (P < .0001). There was also a statistically significant difference in diabetes rates between urban and rural counties (Table 1).\nEarlier studies have reported the increased prevalence of COVID‐19 infections among black and minority populations. 3 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 The higher infection rates among blacks is likely indicative of disparities in access to health care, health inequities, and underlying preexisting health conditions. Blacks are also more likely to work in “essential” jobs where the infection risk is higher. 36 · In this study, adults aged 25‐49 years had a substantially higher prevalence of COVID‐19 in rural counties (t statistics: 18.9) as compared to urban (t statistic: 2.8), adjusted for covariates.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the USDA Economic Research Service, provides data on the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in metro and nonmetro areas in the United States. The data shows that nonmetro areas had a higher prevalence of cumulative COVID-19 cases than metro areas since late October 2020, although the rate of increase has declined in both metro and nonmetro areas since early January 2021. Employment changes in nonmetro areas are inversely related to changes in the unemployment rate, but employment remained 2.6% below the nonmetro employment level from 24 months earlier by November 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published by the Rural Policy Research Institute, highlights the challenges faced by rural areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rural hospitals have limited capacity to deal with surges in cases, limited medical personnel, and less access to ventilators and personal protective equipment. COVID-19 testing rates are also lower in rural areas, increasing the risk of community spread. Rural populations are sicker than urban populations, and rural workers in essential industries like meatpacking, agriculture, and prisons are at increased risk of infections. Residents of rural counties adjacent to metro areas reported the worst outcomes, including positive tests for coronavirus, close friends or family members testing positive, close friends or family members being hospitalized, seeking treatment for anxiety or depression, and financial difficulties.\n\nInformation 3, published by The Daily Yonder and the Associated Press, reports a record number of new COVID-19 cases in rural counties in the U.S. for a second week in a row. Between June 17-24, rural counties recorded more than 23,000 new cases, with increases in Arkansas, California, Florida, Missouri, and Texas. In Lassen County, California, and Hot Spring County, Arkansas, large spikes were linked to outbreaks in prisons, while in McDonald County, Missouri, cases tripled when Tyson Foods tested employees at a chicken plant.\n\nInformation 4, published by the National Rural Health Association, highlights the differences in COVID-19 spread between urban and rural areas. Rural residents have a shorter life expectancy and lower median income than urban residents. Older people are at the highest risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and the median age of rural area residents is 51 years, whereas the median age in urban areas is 45. Rural communities have a larger proportion of residents 65 years and older (18.4% compared to 14.5%).\n\nInformation 5, published by the Journal of Rural Health, reports a study on the progression of COVID-19 from urban to rural areas in the United States.

Mahama had his primary education at the Accra Newtown Experimental School (ANT1) before going to boarding school at Achimota Primary School.\nHe recalls in its first chapter the day in 1966 when he learned of the ousting of Ghana's founding president, Kwame Nkrumah, in a military coup: \"When I look back on my life it's clear to me that this moment marked the awakening of my consciousness. It changed my life and influenced all the moments that followed.\" It was revealed in 2016 that Mahama accepted a Ford Expedition from a construction firm bidding for a lucrative government contract in 2012, while he was serving as vice president.\nJohn Dramani Mahama (/məˈhɑːmə/ ⓘ; born on Saturday, 29 November 1958) is a Ghanaian politician who served as President of Ghana from 24 July 2012 to 7 January 2017.

A member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), he was Member of Parliament for Bole Bamboi from 1997 to 2009 and served as Deputy Minister for Communication between 1997 and 1998 before becoming the substantive Minister for Communications in 1998. Mahama is the first vice president to take over the presidency from the death of his predecessor, John Evans Atta Mills, and is the first head of state of Ghana to have been born after Ghana's independence.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 9, 2020, confirms that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been playing a leading role in providing financial assistance to countries worldwide to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInformation 2, published on February 3, 2015, states that Ghana, under the leadership of President John Mahama, was seeking a financial assistance deal with the IMF to stabilize its economy.\n\nInformation 4, published on August 4, 2014, reveals that Ghana, again under President John Mahama's administration, was seeking financial help from the IMF to strengthen its currency.\n\nInformation 5 is a biography of John Mahama, published on November 19, 2023, which includes his background, education, and political career, but it does not contain any information related to the claim.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, made by Ghanaian ex-president John Mahama on May 1, 2020, states that Togo, Rwanda, and Ivory Coast did not request financial assistance for COVID-19 from the IMF. Given the information available, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim, as the information provided is not directly related to the financial assistance requests of Togo, Rwanda, and Ivory Coast.\n\nHowever, considering John Mahama's past involvement in seeking financial assistance from the IMF for Ghana, it is reasonable to assume that he is knowledgeable about the IMF's financial assistance programs and the processes involved in requesting support. Therefore, it is plausible that he would be aware if Togo, Rwanda, and Ivory Coast had requested assistance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the available information does not directly confirm or deny the claim, the credibility of the source (John Mahama) lends some support to the claim's accuracy. To make a more definitive judgement, additional information regarding Togo, Rwanda, and Ivory Coast's financial assistance requests specifically related to COVID-19 would be required.", "response": "FALSE."}

The bill, called the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, earmarks $100 billion for fiscal year 2020 to improve Americans' health through mobile testing units in medically underserved areas, focusing on hot spots where the rate of infection exceeds the national average.\n\nInformation 2, with no publication date, provides a summary of H.R. 6666 (116th): COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, contains the text for H.R. 6666 - 116th Congress (2019-2020): COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-13, corrects a false claim that H.R. 6666 allows strangers to enter homes, test and remove family members, including children, to be taken into quarantine. The bill allocates $100 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing using mobile health units, but it does not mention forced testing, forced entry, or removal of individuals for quarantine.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, explains that H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to test individuals at their homes and leaves some restrictions open with the \"and for other purposes\" disclaimer. The bill authorizes the expenditure of $100 billion for 2020 and has been sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that House Resolution 6666 includes billions of dollars to fund forced quarantining for Americans who test positive for COVID-19 is false. The correct purpose of the bill, as detailed in the provided information, is to allocate $100 billion for fiscal year 2020 to improve Americans' health through mobile testing units in medically underserved areas, focusing on hot spots where the rate of infection exceeds the national average. The bill does not mention or fund forced quarantining.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-05-09, while the fact-checking article debunking the claim was published on 2020-05-11. The fact-checking article provides accurate information about the purpose of House Resolution 6666, which contradicts the claim. Additionally, the text of the bill and summaries of its contents, provided in Information 2 and 3, further support the fact that the bill does not fund forced quarantining. Information 4 and 5 also confirm that the bill does not include provisions for forced quarantining.", "response": "FALSE."}

The deputies approved the inclusion in the Constitution of the criterion for granting the benefit. The Senate overturned this prediction and the rule should follow as it is today: provided for in ordinary law, more easily modified than a constitutional rule. For those who are against Social Security reform, the government's proposal to establish the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement disregards the different life expectations within Brazil.\nThe Pension reform in Brazil was a proposal by the Brazilian government to amend the Constitution for the reform of the social security system of the country. By changing the country's constitution, it had to be approved in both houses of the National Congress by an absolute majority. The reform was created to combat the giant deficit in the pension system, of more than R$194 billion in 2018, and the rapid aging of the Brazilian population.\nUntil the reform was approved in 2019, other governments had tried to approve their proposals. In Brazil's most recent history, the country has been debating pension reform every ten years, in some cases the proposals have simply been shelved as extremely unpopular, in others, mini-reforms have been made, but with long-term null effects, and in one case, the reform was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by only one vote.\nBrazil's constitution says any amendment must be approved by an absolute majority in both houses, 308 votes in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 votes in the Senate. The main point of the proposal was rejected on the night of 6 May 1998 by the House by only one vote, the deputy Antonio Kandir of the ruling party PSDB, wrongly voted in abstention, causing the defeat of the government and the proposal.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil - Pensions and Benefits - Canada.ca\nContent:\nIf you do not qualify for an Old Age Security pension based on your years of residence in Canada, Canada will consider periods credited under the Brazilian pension program as periods of residence in Canada to help you meet the eligibility requirements.

If you contribute or have contributed to the QPP but not to the CPP, please consult the Québec Pension Plan. The pension program of Brazil is similar to the Canada Pension Plan and covers most employed and self-employed persons in Brazil.\nIf you have lived or worked in Brazil and in Canada, or you are the survivor of someone who has lived or worked in Brazil and in Canada, you may be eligible for pensions or benefits from Brazil or Canada, or both.\nYou may qualify for a Canadian or a Brazilian benefit, or both. However, under the Agreement, the benefit paid by each country will be based solely on your creditable periods under that country’s pension program. In other words, Canada will pay a benefit amount reflecting the portion of your periods that are creditable under Canada's pension program, and Brazil will pay a benefit amount reflecting the portion of your creditable periods under Brazil's pension program.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: What's Happening with Pension Reform in Brazil? | Wilson Center\nContent:\nBrazil’s Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government was very happy with the results and that Congress had done “a beautiful job”. Senator Davi Alcolumbre, President of the National Congress, applauded the effort, stating, “The Brazilian Congress has passed the greatest pension reform in history.”\nLower House sets up its Committee of Constitution and Justice (CCJ) to analyze the government’s proposal to overhaul Brazil’s pension system, and first-term Congressman Felipe Francischini (PSL-PR) is elected as the CCJ’s new president. The Commission is given five sessions to discuss the proposal.\nMoreover, 13 parties expressed the intention to introduce modifications to the proposal regarding rural pensions, benefits to disabled people, and underprivileged elders. ... The House's Special Committee begins analyzing the merits of the proposed bill. There will be 11 public hearings with about 60 guests to discuss the topic of social security and the proposed reform. The committee's chairman, Marcelo Ramos, says he will work to approve the bill and deliver its analysis to the House plenary by July. Polling by the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (CNI) indicates that the amount of people who believe pension reform to be necessary increased to 72 percent in 2019, from 65 percent in 2015.\nThe government predicts R$800 billion ($197 billion) in savings over the next decade as a result of the reform, down from the R$1.2 trillion ($290 billion) projected by Guedes’ economic team in February of this year. The amount received will depend on the years of contribution, with those working the minimum—15 years for women and 20 for men—receiving 60 percent of median salary; and those who work the maximum—40 years for women and 45 for men—receiving 110 percent.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-05-27\nTitle: Brazil government aide says COVID-19's toll on elderly will reduce ...\nContent:\nA top epidemiologist <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong> told Reuters there was &quot;pressure&quot; from President Jair Bolsanaro&#x27;s chief-of-staff&#x27;s office to water down coronavirus restrictions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The challenges of ageism in Brazil - PMC\nContent:\nMany government regulations and programs are established with a particular age group in mind and they thus inadvertently discriminate against persons in other age groups. Job retraining programs are cited as a good example of this type of discrimination because they are generally targeted toward people of \"employable\" ages or of specific gender, racial, or disability statuses (Sampaio, 1999). Brazilian social policies that target the elderly, children, youth and women in reproductive ages may be viewed as ageist policies.\nTherefore this article aims to convey, first, that ageism in Brazil is mainly associated with elderly people and it is a central issue of the debate on intergenerational exchanges and allocation of governmental resources. Second, age discrimination should be combated with educational programs, government intervention and even new legislation.\nTherefore, the increase in benefits and in the participation of the elderly in the labor force as well as the greater public awareness of the dispute for resources between age groups, becomes a plausible explanation for the doubling of Brazilians supporting the idea that older people should be forced to retire from work early when jobs are scarce. Finally, during the 1990s, government efforts at reducing social inequalities among older persons resulted in the National Council of the Rights of Older Persons, which organized conferences, public hearings, and workshops to foster participation.\nSecond, age discrimination should be combated with educational programs, government intervention and even new legislation. Facing the traditional tension between scholarship and activism, we conclude with recommendations to identify and address age discrimination and ageism in the context of current anti-discriminatory policies in Brazil. The “clash of generations” in Brazil whether actual or perceived, real or invented, has come to the centre of policy discussions about the elderly population as well as into popular awareness through the mass media (Goldani, 2005).\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: This is about the pension reform in Brazil, which was proposed by the government to amend the constitution and combat the deficit in the pension system. The proposal was approved in 2019, and it established the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement. The constitution requires an absolute majority in both houses for amendment approval.\n\nInformation 2: This is about the international social security agreements between Canada and Brazil. The agreement covers Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan benefits only. If a person has lived or worked in both countries, they may be eligible for pensions or benefits from both countries.\n\nInformation 3: This is about the progress of pension reform in Brazil. The Lower House set up a committee to analyze the government's proposal to overhaul the pension system. The committee had five sessions to discuss the proposal, and there were 11 public hearings with about 60 guests.

Researchers discovered significant sex differences in risk factors associated with AMI and in the strength of associations among young adults, suggesting the need for a sex-specific preventive strategy.\nResearchers discovered significant sex differences in risk factors associated with AMI and in the strength of associations among young adults, suggesting the need for a sex-specific preventive strategy. For example, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty had stronger associations with AMI in women compared with men, they found. The study was published May 3 in JAMA Network Open. While heart attacks are often associated with older adults, this population-based case-control study examined the relationships among a wide range of AMI-related risk factors involving younger adults.\nThe study found that seven risk factors, many potentially modifiable, collectively accounted for a majority of the total risk of AMI in young women (83.9%) and young men (85.1%). Some of these factors — including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and poverty — have a larger impact on young woman than they do among young men, Lu and her colleagues found. “This study speaks to the importance of specifically studying young women suffering heart attacks, a group that has largely been neglected in many studies and yet is about as large as the number of young women diagnosed with breast cancer,” said Harlan M.\nRaising awareness about the incidence of heart attacks in younger women is a key part of the strategy, she said. The next frontier of cardiovascular disease prevention in young women could be better understanding the role of women-related factors. Previous studies have shown that women-related factors may be associated with risk of heart attack, but there is limited data on women under the age of 55.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-05-15\nTitle: Women and Heart Disease | cdc.gov\nContent:\nHeart attack: Chest pain or discomfort, upper back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea or vomiting, extreme fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath ...

In 1948, there was rising agitation in East Bengal against the omission of Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz Khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of repression while charging protesters.\nOn 23 June 1949, Bengali nationalists from East Bengal broke away from the Muslim League, Pakistan's dominant political party, and established the All Pakistan Awami Muslim League. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Shamsul Huq were elected the first president and general secretary of the party respectively, Ataur Rahman Khan was elected the vice-president, Yar Mohammad Khan was elected as the treasurer, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and A. K. Rafiqul Hussain were elected the party's first joint secretaries. The party was formed to champion the rights of the masses in Pakistan against the powerful feudal establishment led by the Muslim League.\nVeteran student leader and language movement stalwart Khaleque Nawaz Khan defeated incumbent prime minister of the then East Bengal Mr. Nurul Amin in a landslide margin. Mr. Nurul Amin was defeated in his home Nandail constituency. Khaleque Nawaz Khan created history at age 27 by defeating sitting prime minister and Muslim League was wiped out from political landscape of the then East Pakistan. A. K. Fazlul Huq assumed the office of Chief Minister of East Bengal and drew up a cabinet containing many of the prominent student activists that were leading movements against the Pakistani state.\nInspiring from Soviet and Indian economic models, Awami League under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman implemented an economic system based on strict protectionism, state intervention and economic regulation under a planned economy and limited market activities, which was characterized as \"neither capitalist nor socialist\" in nature. Since Sheikh Hasina became the leader of Awami League in 1981, the party begun espousing more economically liberal positions, and has moved closer to the centre of the political spectrum. In 1991, AL president and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina noted that socialism was a failed system.\nThe Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ আওয়ামী লীগ, romanized: Bānglādēsh Awāmī Līg, lit.

After 1971 in Pakistan (West) the PPP led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took power. 1977 Bhutto was removed by General Ziaul Haq through a coup. 1988, after the death of Pakistan's military ruler and later civilian President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a new Muslim League was formed under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, but it had no connection with the original Muslim League.\nThe Muslim League was the original successor of the All-India Muslim League that led the Pakistan Movement to achieve an independent nation. Five of the country's Prime Ministers have been affiliated with this party, namely Liaquat Ali Khan, Khwaja Nazimuddin, M. A. Bogra, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, and I. I. Chundrigar. The Muslim League was defeated in the 1955 elections to the Constituent Assembly by a political alliance known as the United Front.\nThe All-India Muslim League was disbanded in December 1947 and succeeded by two organisations, the Muslim League and the Indian Union Muslim League, the first being its original successor in Pakistan. Jinnah resigned as the president of the Muslim League on 17 December and the two Muslim Leagues respectively elected Ch. Khaliquzzaman as President of the Muslim League (Pakistan) and Muhammad Ismail as the president for Indian Union Muslim League.\nThe party was dissolved in 1958 after the declaration of Martial Law by General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the Commander-in-Chief of Pakistan Army. ...

Within two years of achieving Independence, the League began to lose popular support. In the mean time maulana abdul hamid khan bhasani and other prominent Muslim Leaguers formed the Awami Muslim League in Dhaka in 1949.\nThe League performance in other Muslim dominated provinces of India was equally enthusiastic besides the North West Frontier Province which was still under the Congress influence.

So far as the Muslim community was concerned, Jinnah was now inevitably to be consulted with in all negotiations and agreements concerning the transfer of power by the British. Six years after the Lahore Resolution, HS Suhrahardy moved the resolution for 'a Muslim state' at the Delhi Convention of the Muslim Legislators.

The authors do not think new studies of hydroxychloroquine should be started for treatment of COVID-19.\nThe authors did not find any completed studies of these medicines to stop COVID-19 in people who were at risk of exposure to the virus; studies are still under way. The studies took place in China, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Taiwan, North America, and Europe; one study was worldwide. Some studies were partly funded by pharmaceutical companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine. ... Read the Editorial 'Contested effects and chaotic policies: the 2020 story of (hydroxy) chloroquine for treating COVID-19'\n\nInformation 1, published on an unspecified date, discusses the FDA's caution against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treating or preventing COVID-19. These drugs have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19 and are being studied in clinical trials. The FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for these drugs in treating COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on August 6, 2013, discusses the use of antibiotics for treating viral infections, including COVID-19. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. The FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments for COVID-19 in January 2022 due to their ineffectiveness against the Omicron variant.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 23, 2020, discusses the side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, including heart rhythm issues, liver and kidney problems, nerve cell damage, and low blood sugar. These medicines are being used in the context of the ongoing pandemic for treating patients with COVID-19 and are being investigated in clinical trials. However, clinical data are still very limited and inconclusive, and the beneficial effects of these medicines in COVID-19 have not been demonstrated.\n\nInformation 4, published on an unspecified date, discusses the differences between chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine is an older version with far worse side effects, while hydroxychloroquine is a newer, safer, more effective version.\n\nInformation 5, published on an unspecified date, discusses the results of a study on the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating people ill with COVID-19, preventing the disease in people at risk of getting the disease, and people exposed to the virus developing the disease. The study found that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce deaths from COVID-19 and probably does not reduce the number of people needing mechanical ventilation.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that side effects have halted the use of chloroquine for treating COVID-19 is partially true. While the FDA has cautioned against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing COVID-19 due to their lack of effectiveness and potential side effects, these drugs are still being investigated in clinical trials. However, the claim is misleading as it implies that chloroquine is no longer being used to treat COVID-19, which is not the case. Therefore, the claim should be classified as partially true.", "response": "TRUE."}

Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.\nFinally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system. Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well.\nThe most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon. Our preliminary inventory of food medicines serves as a baseline for future systematic ethnobotanical studies and aims to inspire in-depth research on how use patterns of plant-based foods and beverages, both “traditional” and “new”, are changing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020), a botánica (shop selling Caribbean remedies for health and wellbeing) in the Bronx reported selling much greater volumes online of eucalyptus, chamomile, and anamú (Petiveria alliacea L.), to treat COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, fever, and trouble breathing, together with other plants that allegedly ease anxiety. In an 8-min home video shared on Facebook, a Jamaican-American woman demonstrated how to make “Corona-shots” by blending common Caribbean kitchen ingredients (turmeric, lemon, ginger, onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, and honey).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Africa: Acclaimed home remedies ...\nContent:\nLiterature was compiled from google, social media, Radio and Television commentaries and news with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Additionally, none of the other information sources support the claim that this mixture can cure COVID-19. Instead, they mention potential health benefits and increased consumption during the pandemic but do not claim a cure for the disease.", "response": "FALSE."}

The BVDV antibodies were due to vaccination or exposure to heterologous strains and did not appear to interfere with any BVDV test. These findings illustrate that PI cattle may be identified by several tests, but differentiation of PI cattle from cattle with acute BVDV infection requires additional testing, especially of blood samples and nasal swabs positive on initial testing.\nFive diagnostic tests were performed on skin samples, serum, or both, from cattle in another study (22). Only PI animals were identified by positive ACE and IHC results for the skin samples. The real-time PCR results were also positive in the serum of PI calves; there were instances of false- positive results, perhaps from contamination. Negative ACE results with serum from 2 PI calves were believed to be due to maternal antibodies.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Bovine Diagnostics - What is PCR? | The Cattle Site\nContent:\nPCR results are very reliable with a highly accurate positive or negative outcome with low levels of false positive or false negative results. PCR doesn’t require a viable organism, only DNA is needed to get a result. However, with culture, trying to isolate and grow the infectious agent presents several challenges, especially with handling and transporting fragile organisms like Mycoplasma species.\nPCR is used in outbreak situations and with pathogens that can be tough to culture, but it’s also used in routine disease monitoring programs. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to exponentially reproduce or amplify specific sections of DNA. Those DNA samples can be used to test for mastitis and other disease pathogens. The days of waiting several days or even weeks for culture results are over.\nA more comprehensive understanding of disease status along with the introduction of real-time PCR testing has shifted the way veterinarians and farmers are using diagnostics. PCR is used in outbreak situations and with pathogens that can be tough to culture, but it’s also used in routine disease monitoring programs.\nPCR can provide mastitis results the same day, versus culture which can take up to 10 days. When considering the spread of disease to other cows that may need to be culled during the 10 or more days while waiting for results with culture, that is significant economically to a herd and another reason PCR should be used.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-12\nTitle: Partly false claim: cattle vaccine for coronavirus has been around ...\nContent:\nAn image on social media makes the claim that “America” has <strong>vaccinated</strong> <strong>cattle</strong> <strong>against</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> “<strong>for</strong> years” ( here ) .

It also addresses ongoing management of patients who had bariatric/metabolic surgery in the past and nonsurgical treatment to mitigate harm until patients can undergo the procedures.\nThe document confirms that bariatric/metabolic surgery should remain suspended during the most intense phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and only resume once overall restrictions on nonessential surgeries are lifted. Exceptions are limited to emergency endoscopic interventions for complications of prior surgery, such as hemorrhage or leaks.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he praised Hanks for doing \"a superb job of carrying Cast Away all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time\" by \"never straining for effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.\"\nThe second episode of the seventh season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, \"The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\" refers to a Cast Away scene.

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ...

It is useful to first visualize what different stable matchings look like (refer to the graphs on the right).

Clues may lie with the predisposition to hypoxemia or unexpected absence of dyspnea (‘silent hypoxemia’) in some patients who later develop respiratory failure. Using a recently-validated breath-holding technique, we sought to test the hypothesis that gas exchange and ventilatory control deficits observed at admission are associated with subsequent adverse COVID-19 outcomes (composite primary outcome: non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care admission, or death).\nPatients with COVID-19 (N = 50) performed breath-holds to obtain measurements reflecting the predisposition to oxygen desaturation (mean desaturation after 20-s) and reduced chemosensitivity to hypoxic-hypercapnia (including maximal breath-hold duration). Associations with the primary composite outcome were modeled adjusting for baseline oxygen saturation, obesity, sex, age, and prior cardiovascular disease.\nThe adverse composite outcome (observed in N = 11/50) was associated with breath-holding measures at admission (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.020); specifically, greater mean desaturation (12-fold greater odds of adverse composite outcome with 4% compared with 2% desaturation, p = 0.002) and greater maximal breath-holding duration (2.7-fold greater odds per 10-s increase, p = 0.036). COVID-19 patients who did not develop the adverse composite outcome had similar mean desaturation to healthy controls.\nBreath-holding offers a novel method to identify patients with high risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Greater breath-hold induced desaturation (gas exchange deficit) and greater breath-holding tolerance (ventilatory control deficit) may be independent harbingers of progression to severe disease.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-08-12\nTitle: Fact Check: Viral video Suggesting Self-Check for COVID-19 By Holding ...\nContent:\nDifficulty in breathing can be one of the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) as per World Health Organization (WHO).

Instead, the health organizations advise people who think they might have COVID-19, they should be isolated by staying at home and seek medical attention from the health authority.\nThese are the general recommendation for any breathing exercise and not specifically for this game.

Disclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-26, is a fact-check article by USA Today debunking the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds can be used as a self-check for COVID-19. The article mentions that the test is ineffective in detecting fibrosis, which has not been linked to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, explains that holding your breath for 10 seconds without coughing or discomfort does not indicate the absence of COVID-19. It also mentions that symptoms of COVID-19 can vary greatly between individuals and that holding your breath is not a substitute for an actual COVID-19 test.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-17, is an article by CNN about a dangerous coronavirus \"self-check test\" circulating on social media, which claims that holding your breath for 10 seconds without coughing means you don't have the virus. The article mentions that the post is not affiliated with Stanford Medicine and contains inaccurate information.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, is a study about the use of breath-holding as a method for risk stratification in COVID-19 patients. The study found that greater breath-hold induced desaturation and breath-holding tolerance were associated with an increased risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-08-12, is a fact-check article by Vishvas News debunking the claim that holding your breath for a certain time can be used as a self-check for COVID-19. The article mentions that difficulty in breathing can be a symptom of COVID-19, but there is no such self-check test mentioned in the websites of health organizations.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that holding your breath can let you test whether you may have COVID-19.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\nThe claim is false, based on the information provided. The information clearly states that holding your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or discomfort does not mean you are negative for COVID-19. Additionally, there is no evidence that holding your breath can be used as a reliable self-check for COVID-19. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not mention any such self-check test on their advisories issued for the public. Instead, they advise people who think they might have COVID-19 to seek medical attention from the health authority.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that holding your breath can let you test whether you may have COVID-19 is false, and there is no evidence to support it. It is important to follow the guidelines and recommendations provided by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The most common responses for religion in Bondi Beach were No Religion 41.2% and Catholic 18.9%.\nThe first record of \"bondi\" by European-ancestry Australians was made between 1899 and 1903. It describes the meaning as \"noise made by sea waves breaking on the beach,\" which is essentially the definition of \"surf\" in contemporary American English.

And, a study from Singapore early in the COVID-19 pandemic showed that people who were asymptomatic still were spreading SARS-CoV-2 to others.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-22\nTitle: 1 in 5 COVID-19 Cases Are Asymptomatic but Can Spread the Disease\nContent:\nEven people who don’t show symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested if they’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, according to · guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last Friday. The guidance comes as new research finds that up to 1 in 5 coronavirus infections present with no symptoms but are still contagious. According to the CDC, you should be tested for the virus if you believe you’ve “been in close contact, such as within 6 feet of a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 15 minutes and do not have symptoms.”\nThe guidance comes as new research finds that up to 1 in 5 coronavirus infections present with no symptoms but are still contagious. According to the CDC, you should be tested for the virus if you believe you’ve “been in close contact, such as within 6 feet of a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 15 minutes and do not have symptoms.” · The new study, published today in PLOS Medicine, reviewed information gathered early in the pandemic to find that most coronavirus infections will show symptoms at some point during infection.\n“Therefore, asymptomatic people or people in early stages of disease that may be unaware that they are infected are the most contagious,” Haseltine explained. “While the reported relative percent of new COVID-19 cases who acquired infection from an individual with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is variable, that such transmission occurs is well accepted,” said Dr.\n“Keep in mind that a person with either asymptomatic or presymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection can still transmit the virus,” study authors Diana Buitrago-Garcia, a PhD student, and Nicola Low, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Healthline in a joint emailed statement. Experts say some people may actually have symptoms but not realize they are signs of COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-11-18\nTitle: Symptomatic COVID patients are more contagious, study finds | ...\nContent:\nThe study, which was published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine, supports the idea that if a person with COVID-19 is sicker, they are more contagious compared to asymptomatic cases. The findings provide further evidence for interventions like contact tracing, masking and vaccines, says lead author Yang Ge, a doctoral student in UGA's College of Public Health. \"We found asymptomatic cases had lower transmissibility compared to symptomatic cases and were less likely to infect their contacts. In addition, we found that contacts that developed COVID-19 infections were more likely to be asymptomatic if they were exposed to an asymptomatic case,\" said Ge.\nAug. 4, 2021  Data from a University of Arizona Health Sciences longitudinal study on COVID-19 shows that 67 percent of people with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection develop long COVID, with symptoms that last ...

The study also finds that infected ... Research Shows Many With Mild COVID-19 Infections Still Experience Long-Term Symptoms\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-04-14, is about a study presented at the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) 2023 Spring Conference. The study, conducted by Stanford University immunocompromised infectious disease fellow Ralph Tayyar, MD, found that most asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were not infectious.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the role of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections in spreading the virus and mentions a meta-analysis by Cevik, M. et al.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-11-05, states that nearly 40% of children ages 6 to 13 tested positive for COVID-19 but were asymptomatic. The article also mentions that asymptomatic cases had the same viral load in their nasal areas, meaning they had the same capacity to spread the virus compared to symptomatic individuals.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-09-22, states that up to 1 in 5 coronavirus infections present with no symptoms but are still contagious. The CDC guidance recommends testing if you've been in close contact with a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 15 minutes, even if you don't have symptoms.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2023-11-18, supports the idea that symptomatic COVID-19 patients are more contagious compared to asymptomatic cases. The study found that asymptomatic cases had lower transmissibility compared to symptomatic cases and were less likely to infect their contacts.\n\nClaim: A study shows that COVID-19 asymptomatics are not contagious.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is not accurate. Information 1, 3, 4, and 5 all suggest that asymptomatic individuals can still be contagious. Information 1 specifically states that most asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were not infectious, but not all. Information 5 supports the idea that symptomatic patients are more contagious, but asymptomatic individuals can still transmit the virus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual study findings. It is possible that the study found that most asymptomatic individuals were not infectious, but this does not mean that all asymptomatic individuals are not contagious.

Jema says he raises pigs solely to get additional income to send his children to school as his usual farmer’s income is not enough.\nHe was told by local officials that this was due to African Swine Fever (ASF), a virus that began to infect pigs in several Indonesian regions earlier last year. More universal than Catholicism? Mary among Asian religions · Jema says he has been left devastated as he was to use the pigs to pay for the education of his third daughter, who is studying agriculture at the Indonesia Catholic University of St.\nThe disease is a grave threat to the 8.5 million pig population in Indonesia, the department says. Joe Saragih, a veterinarian and lecturer at the University of Nusa Cendana in Kupang, said the virus can spread quickly because pork products are everywhere in the region and it cannot be ascertained whether they contain the virus or not. \"The government has banned pigs and pork products from being taken out of infected areas, but this rule is not easy to enforce,” he told UCA News.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-02-25\nTitle: The Truth about Diseased Pork in Indonesia - Your View En.tempo.co\nContent:\nAccompanied by disturbing images of hideous, painful lesions on both pigs and human ‘victims,’ the hoax warned Indonesians to avoid pork meat at all costs.  · Areas in Indonesia affected by swine diseases.

In June, International Monetary Fund predicted that the global economy would shrink by 4.9 percent in 2020, warning of especially harsh conditions for low-income households.1World economic outlook update, June 2020, International Monetary Fund, June 2020, imf.org. Indonesia had already cut its 2020 GDP growth outlook to 2.3 percent, from 5.3 percent, by April.2Arys Aditya and Karlis Salna, “Indonesia slashes growth forecast by more than half on virus,” Bloomberg, April 1, 2020, bloomberg.com.\nSince then, the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia has grown, with some 145,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 6,000 related deaths being reported (Exhibit 1).3“New cases of COVID-19 in world countries,” Johns Hopkins University, August 20, 2020, coronavirus.jhu.edu. The country’s immediate priority is undoubtedly to mitigate and contain the impact of the pandemic on a number of fronts—for example, by encouraging safe behaviors, intervening immediately to mitigate healthcare-capacity constraints, and pushing hard on COVID-19 testing.\nSuch factors include the appearance, duration, and severity of any subsequent wave of COVID-19 cases; time needed to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine; depth of economic disruption; and ability to recover. Despite those uncertainties, however, now is the time for Indonesia to consider the various trends that will define the next normal (Exhibit 2):\nWith those themes in mind, we have looked at how Indonesia can reimagine and reform itself after the COVID-19 crisis by considering the following opportunities: increasing national resilience, accelerating the economic transition, rebuilding the tourist sector, and enabling genuine change (Exhibit 3).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-07-19\nTitle: Understanding Meat Consumption Trends in Indonesia and its Regencies ...\nContent:\nThe dataset for meat consumption data and PDRB are coming from Indonesia’s National Bureau of Statistics (BPS). The data is from 2017–2021, which is kind of great because we could also see whether the Covid-19 pandemic affects meat consumption.\nThe average consumption data declines dramatically from 19.83 Kg to 0.18 Kg, then it increases again by a small fraction. I am afraid this is caused by too many empty data on the dataset. Another thing to notice is that during the Covid-19 year (2020–2021), the average meat consumption per capita was still increasing despite the lockdown in each regency in Indonesia during the Covid-19 year.\nThe total average meat consumption trend is increased year-by-year despite the covid-19 restriction, although the increment is only fractions. There is also an anomaly in goat meat consumption, which it suddenly decreased from 2018 to 2019. This decline might affect our analysis of the PDRB relationship with the overall average meat consumption per capita in each regency in Indonesia.\nThe data is from 2017–2021, which is kind of great because we could also see whether the Covid-19 pandemic affects meat consumption. The dimension of our dataset is 2057 rows and 9 columns. The datasets for average meat consumption per capita in one week and PDRB are coming in separate files.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-01-18, is an article about an Indonesian farmer, Jema, who raises pigs for additional income to send his children to school. However, a virus called African Swine Fever (ASF) has been infecting pigs in several Indonesian regions, causing devastation to farmers like Jema. The virus poses a grave threat to Indonesia's 8.5 million pig population.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-02-25, discusses a hoax warning Indonesians to avoid pork meat due to a disease. The hoax went viral in areas with high pork consumption, such as Bali, Papua, Sulawesi, and Sumatra.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-06, is a COVID-19 information release by the U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Indonesia.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-09-08, is an article about the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Indonesia and the country's priorities in mitigating the pandemic's effects.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2023-07-19, is an analysis of meat consumption trends in Indonesia and its regencies from 2017 to 2021.

(Published on 2020-03-06)\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. The claim was published before Information 1, which explains that the virus affecting pigs in Indonesia is African Swine Fever (ASF), not COVID-19.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread.

Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe.

It comes from the 2008 book “End Of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world” by Sylvia Browne, an American author who claimed to be a psychic (see the page here). This claim is therefore partly false. Dean Koontz did write about a fictional virus called “Wuhan-400” in the 1989 re-release of his 1981 novel “The Eyes of Darkness”, but symptoms and effects of the disease do not match the official description of COVID-19.\nPosts featuring the cover of “The Eyes of Darkness” book and a page in which Koontz allegedly describes the coronavirus in his novel have at least 39,000 shares (examples here and here) and at least 2,000 retweets on Twitter (examples here and here) as of February 27, 2020. Most of the claims circulating on social media show the book’s cover and a page in the book mentioning a virus called “Wuhan-400”. The widely circulated photo of Koontz’s book page includes some highlighted text reading: “They call the stuff ‘Wuhan-400’ because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan, and It was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center”.\nIn the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of “Gorki” and it was meant to be the “Soviet’s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade”. This is confirmed by a Google Books’ search of the word “Wuhan” in the 1981 edition (here). In this edition “Wuhan-400” brings no results. According to the South China Morning Post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the Cold War. Their article here includes photographs of the previous edition that references “Gorki-400”). In this edition, Koontz also published his novel under his real name instead of using his pseudonym “Leigh Nichols”.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-03-13\nTitle: No, Dean Koontz did not predict the coronavirus in a 1981 novel | CNN\nContent:\nOne particularly striking example comes from a thriller novel by Dean Koontz called “The Eyes of Darkness.” · In a tweet that has since been widely shared, someone said that Koontz had predicted the coronavirus outbreak based on a screenshot of a page in the book.

The name of the weapon was changed to “Wuhan-400” when the book was released again in 1989, according to the South China Morning Post.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-03\nTitle: Fact check: The 1981 Dean Koontz book ‘The Eyes of Darkness’ ...\nContent:\nThe 1981 edition of “The Eyes of Darkness” that can be viewed on Google Books shows that the virus was originally named “Gorki-400” for being developed outside of “Gorki” by Russians.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false. These claims have been consistently debunked by multiple sources and there is no evidence to support them.", "response": "FALSE."}

Here’s a quick guide on how to spot symptoms, risk factors, prevent spread of the disease, and find out what to do if you think you have it.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Contact Tracing Apps: Lessons Learned on Privacy, Autonomy, and ...\nContent:\nThere has been a wide variety of COVID-19 contact tracing app reviews published over the course of the pandemic across a range of subjects, including technical analysis [10,11], privacy concerns [12-14], and ethics [15-18], each of which present valuable information on a specific aspect of digital contact tracing.\nThis viewpoint is designed to combine information from across the expanding COVID-19 digital contact tracing literature and address key considerations that must be taken into account for developing and refining future contact tracing app design. This paper aims to accomplish this goal by providing background on common strategies for app-based contact tracing, discussing the advantages and limitations of several prominent COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and elucidating the privacy and nonprivacy concerns that have affected their adoption and reliability during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeveral surveys have been conducted worldwide to understand opinions about digital contact tracing apps, and the primary cited reasons for not using apps were privacy, security, and surveillance. Given the large concern from users, privacy, security, surveillance, and transparency must be at the forefront of future and current contract tracing app designs.\nSingapore’s TraceTogether app was the first national deployment of a Bluetooth-based contact tracing system in the world. The app was presented as being “for the people,” with the ultimate goal of protecting the population [33]. This Singaporean technology provides several lessons for contact tracing, including concerns about Bluetooth, the privacy-utility tradeoff, as well as centralized and decentralized systems.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19, digital privacy, and the social limits on data-focused ...\nContent:\nWhile only a few years ago this debate might have been a somewhat abstract one carried out largely in the rarefied air of academic or public policy discourse, a litany of major scandals over the use of citizens’ digital data in illicit ways by companies such as Cambridge Analytica (Isaak & Hanna, 2018), escalating concerns over digital surveillance and espionage, especially by authoritarian governments, and high-profile clashes between politicians and public officials in several jurisdictions and the operators of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, have given these concerns central prominence in the public sphere. The deep divide between different philosophies over digital contact tracing, data sharing and user privacy are therefore anything but abstract; they are reflections of real-world issues which have the potential to profoundly impact the efficacy and success of the technology – efficacy and success which will, in this instance, ultimately be measured in lives saved or\nGiven the overall climate of concern over privacy rights, the melange of different approaches and the strong voices calling for data-first systems which require citizens to utterly trust the government authorities actually risk making digital contact tracking largely ineffective.\nPerhaps the most significant role of ICT in the pandemic, however, and certainly one of the most controversial and contested even at this early stage, is the experimental adoption of digital contact tracing and exposure notification – using citizens’ personal digital devices such as smartphones to trace their physical movements and interactions with other citizens, thus allowing citizens themselves or medical authorities to be notified when they have come into contact with infected individuals.\nAs frustrating as it may be for researchers and health authorities watching this potential treasure trove of data being locked away and destroyed, it is important to remember that the data in question is the personal data of citizens – and in recording all of their contact interactions (and in some cases, all of their movements) it represents arguably the most personal and intimate data a government has ever sought to gather about its own citizens. It is entirely unsurprising that this would immediately run afoul of privacy concerns which reassurances regarding the trustworthiness of government agencies, the limitations on the distribution and use of the data, and technical measures such as the anonymisation of identifying data have done little to assuage.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Privacy concerns can explain unwillingness to download and use ...\nContent:\nA national survey of attitudes to COVID-19 digital contact tracing in the Republic of Ireland.

In 2013, WebMD published an article discussing privacy concerns that could hinder digital contact tracing for COVID-19, even though the article is not specifically about the 2020 pandemic.\n2. A paper discusses lessons learned from various reviews of COVID-19 contact tracing apps, focusing on technical aspects, privacy concerns, and ethical issues. Surveys indicate that users are concerned about privacy, security, and surveillance, which affects app adoption. Singapore's TraceTogether app provides insights into Bluetooth technology, privacy-utility tradeoffs, and centralized/decentralized systems.\n3. An article discusses the broader context of privacy concerns related to digital contact tracing in the wake of data scandals, surveillance, and data sharing concerns. The debate over digital contact tracing, data sharing, and user privacy is prominent, and privacy concerns may impact the effectiveness of digital contact tracing.\n4. A national survey in the Republic of Ireland found that privacy concerns can explain unwillingness to download and use digital contact tracing apps.\n5. Another piece discusses privacy concerns as an explanation for unwillingness to use digital contact tracing apps, focusing on governments' use of technology for public health, including electronic health records and portable fitness devices.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that privacy concerns are hindering digital contact tracing is likely true, as there is a consistent theme of privacy issues affecting the adoption and effectiveness of contact tracing apps across various sources. However, the claim does not provide specific details about the context or location of these privacy concerns. Based on the information, it is accurate to say that privacy concerns are a general hindrance to digital contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic, so the claim can be classified as TRUE.", "response": "TRUE."}

These outcomes are likely to be of interest to policy makers and those planning future pandemic responses. Billions of people around the world were directly or indirectly affected by school closures during the initial COVID-19 waves.\nProfessor Kamal R Mahtani, senior author and GP & Professor of Evidence Based Healthcare, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford said: 'Our comprehensive review, which systematically included over 132 unique studies, highlights some of the global impacts of COVID-19 related school closures. While there may be some association with reduced community transmission, there is also notable associations of harm, including worsening physical and mental health, loss of learning and increased domestic violence.\nThe review will be shared with UK COVID-19 inquiry, who may use the work to audit decisions made by governments on schools during the pandemic. Given the possibility of school closures during future COVID-19 waves (or to combat other pandemics) there is a need for high-quality evidence to assess their efficacy and drawbacks. The full paper, 'School closures during COVID-19: an overview of systematic reviews', can be read in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.\nAlthough school closures were used in most countries and multiple times as a potential method to reduce the likelihood of transmission and death of COVID-19, the effectiveness of closures and their potential longer-term impacts on school-aged children remain largely unknown. The new study, published today in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, suggests that while there may have been some benefits in reducing community transmission of COVID-19, there were also clear harms to children, some of which, much like COVID infection itself, may continue to have longer term negative impacts.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Addressing the Consequences of School Closure Due to COVID‐19 ...\nContent:\nGiven what we know about the trajectory of children's summer weight gain compared with weight gain during the school year (Weaver, Beets, & Brazendale, 2018), children may be at added risk for unhealthy weight gain during the extended school closure because of the lack of structure at home, lack of physical activity, and easy access to snacks. Moreover, unhealthy weight gain may differentially impact food insecure children compared with their food secure peers (Lee, Kubik, & Fulkerson, 2019).\nThis recognition creates a window of opportunity for programmatic and policy changes (Kingdon, 2010) to implement solutions to better help students in need of nonacademic services and supports, especially disadvantaged youth. Expanding participation in free meals among children from low‐income families is a policy lever to address food insecurity and obesity. As part of the Healthy, Hunger‐Free Kids Act of 2010, states were allowed to directly certify students in the National School Lunch Program through participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, thus eliminating the barrier that required families to complete an additional application for free school meals.\nOpportunities therefore exist for states to better identify and link eligible students for subsidized school meals through existing data sources. The Healthy Hunger‐Free Kids Act also permits the country's highest poverty schools and districts to provide universal free meals for students (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2019). With economic instability and job loss at historic levels due to COVID‐19, the need to fund free school meals will increase. In addition to funding meals for all students, creating standards around the length of the lunch period (i.e., 30 minutes) would allow children to have more time to get their meal, sit down, and ultimately eat more food at lunch (Cohen et al., 2016).\nWith very little advanced notice, school districts informed families that their children would be home for multiple weeks; in some cases, through the end of the academic year. As of April 17, 2020, 43 states; Washington, DC; and the U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands) ordered school closures; closures were recommended in the remaining seven states (Education Week, 2020).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-04-08, discusses the potential impact of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood obesity, particularly among Hispanic and black youngsters and those who are already overweight. The expert, Andrew Rundle, suggests that schools should prioritize physical education during remote teaching.\n* Information 2, published on 2023-11-18, mentions that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic \"may prove to be the most damaging disruption in the history of American education,\" causing significant learning losses, widening the achievement gap between poor and wealthy children, and leading to diminished lifetime earnings and a significant drag on the economy.\n* Information 3, with no specific publication date, highlights that school closures followed by summer holidays pose the biggest risk of children gaining too much weight.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, provides a comprehensive review of over 132 unique studies, revealing that school closures are associated with negative impacts on children's education, health, and wellbeing, including increased anxiety, reduced learning, and increased obesity.\n* Information 5, with no specific publication date, focuses on the consequences of school closure due to COVID-19, emphasizing the potential for unhealthy weight gain during the extended school closure, particularly among food-insecure children. The text suggests policy levers such as expanding participation in free meals among children from low-income families and creating standards around the length of the lunch period.\n\nBased on the provided information, the CLAIM \"School Closures May Be Adding to Kids' Waistlines\" (2020-04-08) is TRUE. Information 1, published on the same date as the claim, supports the idea that school closures may contribute to childhood obesity.

New research suggests that a significant number of mammals could be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.\nA new study has found that SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically infect a large number of mammals. The research, which appears in the journal Scientific Reports, identifies important animal species that should be the focus of future real-world observations. Central to scientific efforts to reduce the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the development of a vaccine.\nSARS-CoV-2 infects a host cell by attaching to ACE2 proteins. It is very effective at this in humans. As well as ACE2 proteins, the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is central to the virus’s ability to infect a host cell.\nNew research suggests that a significant number of mammals could be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. ...

Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-02-11\nTitle: Animals and COVID-19 | CDC\nContent:\nThere is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people. There have been a few reports of infected mammalian animals spreading the virus to people during close contact, but this is rare. These cases include farmed mink in Europe and the United States, white-tailed deer in Canada, pet hamsters in Hong Kong, and a cat in Thailand. In most of these cases, the animals were known to be first infected by a person who had COVID-19.\nCDC, USDA, state public health and animal health officials, and academic partners are working in some states to conduct active surveillance (proactive testing) of SARS-CoV-2 in pets, including cats, dogs, and other small mammals, that had contact with a person with COVID-19. CDC deployed One Health teams to multiple states to support state and local departments of health and agriculture, federal partners, and others in conducting on-farm investigations into SARS-CoV-2 in people, mink, and other animals (domestic and wildlife).\nSome coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect people. Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is rare. This is what happened with SARS-CoV-2, which likely originated in bats.\nAnimals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented around the world. Most of these animals became infected after contact with people with COVID-19, including owners, caretakers, or others who were in close contact. We don’t yet know all of the animals that can get infected.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Do animals get infected with SARS-CoV-2 or get COVID-19? – RSPCA ...\nContent:\nThere are now many millions of cases globally of human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19. There is also evidence that many animal species (domestic and wild) may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 from humans infected with the virus [1]. However, the evidence indicates that animals do not play a significant role in infection of humans and that the human COVID-19 pandemic is sustained through human-human transmission [2, 3].\nAlthough many individual domestic animals have now been shown to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 [1], it is unusual for infected animals to show signs of illness and these have generally been mild. Crucially, there is no evidence that domestic animals are significantly involved in the spread of COVID-19 [1].\nThere is evidence of infection (both experimental and natural) of a range of wild and domesticated animals with SARS-CoV-2 [1, 4]. Susceptibility to the virus (how easily a species can be infected with the virus) varies across species. The likelihood of and severity of clinical signs of disease in the infected animal and potential to transmit the virus to other animals, also varies across species and more information continues to emerge about this.\nThe wild and captive wild species currently known to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 include [1, 4, 5]: horseshoe bat, feline species (including tiger, puma, lion, snow leopard, fishing cat, lynx), ferret, mink, hippopotamus, binturong, white-tailed deer, otter, spotted hyena, coatimundi, bushy-tailed woodrat, striped skunk, North American deer mice, Egyptian fruit bats, primates (including macaques, gorilla, savanna monkey), and raccoon dog.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 is more widespread in animals than we thought\nContent:\nIf SARS-CoV-2 can infect opossums, they reasoned, it’s likely that it could infect a massive variety of mammals. Indeed, the team found signs of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in significant percentages of six urban wildlife species in southwestern Virginia. They also obtained positive PCR hits—which are indicative of but don’t prove infection—in two of these species and in another four others, including red foxes and bobcats.\nHow does SARS-CoV-2 infect such a big range of species, and what are the impacts? A major reason lies in a complicated receptor found in all mammals, called ACE-2. This receptor plays an important role in regulating blood pressure and other physiological functions. Once the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enters the body, it begins infecting host cells by binding to the ACE-2 receptor, which is widespread in the upper airways and sinuses of humans and many other mammals.\nCarla Finkielstein, a co-author of the paper, along with Hoyt and conservation biologist Amanda Goldberg, were surprised when they first found evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Virginia opossums. “We were worried, because that means it’s jumping” to distantly related mammals, Finkielstein says.\nFrom lions and tigers to big hairy armadillos, a growing number of animals have been infected with the coronavirus. Here’s what we’ve learned.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Predicting mammalian species at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 ...\nContent:\nSARS-CoV-2 can transmit efficiently in humans, but it is less clear which other mammals are at risk of being infected. SARS-CoV-2 encodes a Spike (S) protein that binds to human ACE2 receptor to mediate cell entry. A species with a human-like ACE2 receptor could therefore be at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2.\nSARS-CoV-2 encodes a Spike (S) protein that binds to human ACE2 receptor to mediate cell entry. A species with a human-like ACE2 receptor could therefore be at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. We compared between 132 mammalian ACE2 genes and between 17 coronavirus S proteins.\nBats are likely reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, but there are other high-risk mammals that share better ACE2 homologies with human. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related to bat coronavirus. Yet, among host-specific coronaviruses infecting high-risk mammals, key ACE2-binding sites on S proteins share highest similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV and between SARS-CoV and Civet-CoV.\nWhile it is evident that SARS-CoV-2 can transmit efficiently from person to person, it is less clear which other mammalian species are at high risk of being infected. The answer to this question is important to (1) improve our ability to predict and control future pandemics, and (2) manage and protect wildlife and domesticated animals.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-08, is an article suggesting that a significant number of mammals could be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, based on a new study in the Scientific Reports journal. The virus infects a host cell by attaching to ACE2 proteins and the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-02-11 by the CDC, states that animals do not play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 to people, although there have been rare cases of infected mammals spreading the virus to people during close contact. Some coronaviruses infect only animals and do not infect people, while others that infect animals can be spread to people but this is rare.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2020 · The swine flu debacle has long been a taboo subject in American politics, perhaps because it left such a deep and traumatic scar on our society.

While it is true that the Obama-Biden administration's handling of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu was not flawless, the claim that it was a disaster is a matter of interpretation. The report by Politico suggests that the administration's response was hampered by muddled messaging and overly ambitious promises, but it does not necessarily mean that the response was a disaster. Additionally, the claim that the swine flu was a disaster is not entirely accurate, as it was a less severe pandemic compared to COVID-19.

The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nHome testing kits are available which can help confirm your infection and let you know when it is safe to be around others.

Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.\nThe FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests.

But he wasn’t the first, nor the last, to implement it. Nicholas Machiavelli famously said: “Politics have no relations to moral.” The Italian politician and diplomate believed that, for a leader, it’s better to be feared than to be loved.\nConquerors are compulsive storytellers — they use every opportunity to feed anger and violence. However, deceiving tactics work in the short-term — in the long run, people end up separating fiction from reality. Creating a common enemy is the most usual way to divide people — leaders force us to choose between being in favor of or against their crusade. Hitler said: “Our strategy is to destroy the enemy from within, to conquer him through himself.” The delusional leader used the ‘them’ versus ‘us’ approach as an excuse to invade most European countries — conquerors succeed when they create two sides.\nThe ultimate objective of divide-and-conquer is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up groups into smaller and less powerful ones. Conquerors will do whatever it takes to win — they don’t care about the future. Like Attila the Hun said: “There, where I have passed, the grass will never grow again.” · The opposite of divide and conquer is ‘unite and build.’\nAs de Bono said: “Companies that solely focus on competition will ultimately die. Those that focus on value creation will thrive.” · “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” — Aristotle · Builders inspire people to follow a bigger mission; Conquerors want followers — they want people to follow them.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Principles of American government (article) | Khan Academy\nContent:\nLearn for free about math, art, computer programming, economics, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, finance, history, and more.

Should It?\n\nPRIOR KNOWLEDGE:\nInformation 1:\nPublication date: 2023-02-16\nTitle: Telehealth policy changes after the COVID-19 public health ...\nContent:\nFind out which telehealth policies are permanent and which are temporary.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2022-10-11\nTitle: The Future of Telehealth After COVID-19\nContent:\nBecause of telehealth’s ability to make care more accessible, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has historically projected that expansions in telehealth will increase health care spending; however, an individual’s clinical condition as well as how virtual care is being used by a provider are both key factors in determining the balance of substitutive versus additive care. The temporary policy changes to expand telehealth, and the increased utilization that resulted, raise a series of questions about whether policymakers should make these changes permanent. What types of services should remain accessible via telehealth beyond the PHE?\nFor starters, Congress and the Biden administration should extend most of the telehealth flexibilities for Medicare beneficiaries for two years after the end of the PHE, and formally evaluate their impact. Researchers should evaluate the benefits of hybrid (in-person and virtual) care models for primary and specialty care, including for which conditions and specialties it is most effective, further evaluate full telehealth flexibilities in the context of value-based payment models, and rigorously assess the quality of audio-only care.\nFinally, Medicare should leverage its current process to refine reimbursement rates for telehealth after the PHE to better reflect the effort and expenses for the type of care delivered. The more Medicare pays, the higher the beneficiary out-of-pocket spending for telehealth services. Policymakers should end broad payment parity between telehealth and in-person care, which may help retain telehealth providers participating in Medicare, but which also may overpay such providers relative to their costs.\nMedicare already allows flexibility for providers participating in APMs to bill for telehealth services, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) should allow current telehealth flexibilities in all new models where providers are participating in two-sided risk. After the onset of COVID-19, telehealth was essential in maintaining beneficiaries’ access to services.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-11-21\nTitle: What happens to telemedicine after COVID-19?\nContent:\nLooking ahead, observers note that government funding likely will bolster access to telehealth. In August, the Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes $65 billion for extending broadband. The House may vote before the end of the year, but the timing remains uncertain. Rodriguez hopes patients and health care leaders will speak up about the value of telemedicine. “It’s crucial for patients’ voices to be heard, especially those who are marginalized, to make sure we do right by them,” he says.\nBut during the federal COVID-19 PHE, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) made a dramatic change: It allowed Medicare coverage of telehealth for any patient, anywhere, as well as payment equal to in-person visits. That matters not just because Medicare insures 62 million older or disabled Americans but because its actions can influence what state agencies and private insurers decide to do. Now, a key question is how long the government will extend the PHE declaration.\nAuthorities greatly expanded telemedicine access during COVID-19. But as many emergency rules end, patients and doctors worry about the future of remote care.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-05-15\nTitle: These Four Telehealth Changes Should Stay, Even After the Pandemic ...\nContent:\nAllowing FaceTime and other “non-public facing” video conferencing platforms for telehealth has helped individuals with limited technology literacy or other access barriers. However, the risk to patient confidentiality must be addressed. Some of these platforms have proven less than secure. After the pandemic, it will be necessary to reverse the HIPAA flexibility policy, but that must be accompanied by a federal effort to increase broadband access, and practice-based efforts to help patients improve their technology literacy so they can access telehealth through truly secure platforms.\nThis should continue after the pandemic. Also, FQHCs and RHCs must continue to be allowed to be the distant site in telehealth encounters. This has improved health care access for historically marginalized populations and will be beneficial as we continue to strive for health equity.\nPhysicians should be able to continue to prescribe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications to patients they have known since birth after those patients go off to college in another state, for example, or adjust the blood pressure medications of a long-time patient who is visiting family in another state. The interstate licensing compact is a step in the right direction, but more should be done to permanently remove the barriers for treating across state lines now that telehealth has made it more feasible and common.\nBut it also has allowed opiate pain medications, as well as other substances with a high propensity for abuse, to be prescribed without an in-person visit. After the pandemic, access to controlled substances via telehealth should be maintained, but with some restrictions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-08-25\nTitle: Executive Summary: Tracking Telehealth Changes State-by-State in ...\nContent:\nSubscribe to our newsletters and client alerts and receive our attorneys’ and professionals’ unique insights on recent trends and developments in the legal world in over 30 different areas of law. Find a list of recent newsletters below.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2023, discusses the permanency of telehealth policies after the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) and suggests that Congress and the Biden administration should extend most telehealth flexibilities for Medicare beneficiaries for two years after the end of the PHE. Researchers are encouraged to evaluate the benefits of hybrid (in-person and virtual) care models, further evaluate full telehealth flexibilities in the context of value-based payment models, and rigorously assess the quality of audio-only care. Medicare should also refine reimbursement rates for telehealth after the PHE.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2022, highlights the temporary policy changes to expand telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for policymakers to consider making these changes permanent. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating the impact of telehealth on healthcare spending and determining which services should remain accessible via telehealth beyond the PHE.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2021, discusses the expansion of telehealth access during the federal COVID-19 PHE and the importance of government funding for extending broadband access. It also mentions concerns about the future of remote care as many emergency rules end and the need for patients and healthcare leaders to speak up about the value of telemedicine.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2021, outlines four telehealth changes that should stay even after the pandemic, including allowing FaceTime and other non-public facing video conferencing platforms, enabling FQHCs and RHCs to be the distant site in telehealth encounters, allowing physicians to prescribe controlled substances with some restrictions, and maintaining interstate licensing compact.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2023, is a call to action for subscribing to newsletters and client alerts to receive unique insights on recent trends and developments in the legal world in over 30 different areas of law. It does not contain relevant information to the claim.\n\nClaim: \"Will Telehealth Remain After COVID? Should It?\"\n\nBased on the information provided, it is clear that telehealth has expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many policy changes have been temporary. However, there is a growing consensus among policymakers and healthcare professionals that some of these changes should be made permanent. This includes extending most of the telehealth flexibilities for Medicare beneficiaries for two years after the end of the PHE, allowing non-public facing video conferencing platforms, maintaining FQHCs and RHCs as the distant site in telehealth encounters, and allowing physicians to prescribe controlled substances with some restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true, but it lacks specific details about which telehealth policies should remain after the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information provided, it is likely that some telehealth policies will remain after the pandemic, but the final decision will depend on the evaluation of their impact on healthcare spending, quality of care, and patient outcomes.", "response": "TRUE."}

Science, abg6296, this issue p. 1439 · Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is still under debate.\nAirborne transmission is one of the main pathways for the transmission of respiratory viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Wearing face masks has been widely advocated to mitigate transmission. Masks are thought to protect people in two ways: (i) source control, reducing the emission and spread of respiratory viruses through airborne droplets and aerosols, and (ii) wearer protection, reducing the inhalation of airborne respiratory viruses.\nIn this work, we develop a quantitative model of airborne virus exposure that can explain these contrasting results and provide a basis for quantifying the efficacy of face masks. We show that mask efficacy strongly depends on airborne virus abundance. On the basis of direct measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples and population-level infection probabilities, we find that the virus abundance in most environments is sufficiently low for masks to be effective in reducing airborne transmission.\nUnder this assumption, wearing a mask would have the same effect on the transmission of a virus disease at any level of infection probability. Our analysis, however, shows that the efficacy of face masks depends strongly on the level of infection probability and virus abundance: Masks reduce the infection probability by as much as their filter efficiency for respiratory particles in the virus-limited regime but much less in the virus-rich regime (Fig.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2013-08-06, provides recommendations on preventing the transmission of COVID-19, including wearing high-quality face masks, washing hands, keeping surfaces clean, and getting vaccinated.

That would suggest “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza,” the editorial said. After the WHO announced the 3.4% mortality rate, a number of medical experts asserted that the rate would shrink over time. “When we see systems that are able to account for not only the really sick, but also those who have infection and are outpatients, the CFR [case fatality rate] is more accurate and drops considerably,” Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said in an interview with the website Vox.\nTrump says the true rate is much lower because the WHO’s rate does not take into account unreported cases. The WHO rate comes from the actual number of known cases and fatalities. The dispute began March 3 when the head of the WHO announced that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus was 3.4%, which was higher than previously believed and made it far more deadly than the seasonal flu. “Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 (the disease spread by the virus) cases have died,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a briefing.\n“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 (the disease spread by the virus) cases have died,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a briefing. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.” · He said there had been 90,893 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3,110 deaths.\nThe World Health Organization says that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died – a global fatality figure that President Donald Trump dismissed as “a false number.” It’s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-08, discusses a video claiming that Biden's press corps admitted COVID-19 was a hoax because the case fatality rate is similar to the seasonal flu.

The bacterial and fungal contamination on used masks from hospital personnel working in the male and female medical wards and out-patient department, as well as the bacterial and fungal counts of the indoor air sample collected from the same area were relatively higher than the other wards.\nThe predominant isolated bacteria and fungi contaminated on inside and outside areas of the used masks and air samples were similar (Staphylococcus spp. and Aspergillus spp.; respectively). For its relationship, results found that bacterial and fungal counts in air samples showed significantly positive correlation with the bacterial contamination load on outside area of the used masks, r=0.16, p=0.018 and r=0.21, p=0.003, respectively.\nTo assess the relationship of bacterial and fungal contamination on used surgical masks worn by the hospital personnel and microbial air quality in their working wards. This is a cross-sectional study of 230 used surgical masks collected from 214 hospital personnel, and 215 indoor air samples collected from their working wards to culture for bacterial and fungal counts.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-07-10\nTitle: Fact check: Masks worn during COVID-19 response do not cause fungal ...\nContent:\nNash said that someone who already has a fungal infection in their lungs could possibly contaminate their own mask, but not the other way around. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “fungi are common in the environment, and people breathe in or come in contact with fungal spores every day without getting sick. However, in people with weak immune systems, these fungi are more likely to cause an infection” ( here ).  · “A fungus can infect the lung and cause a variety of problems ranging from an abscess to pneumonia to an asthmatic reaction,” Dr.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-24, states that masks do not increase the risk of developing pneumonia or any other bacterial, fungal, or viral infections in the lungs. It also mentions that masks are safe and effective for most people, with some exceptions such as very young children and people with certain health conditions.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-22, reaffirms the previous information, stating that there is no evidence to suggest that mask-wearing can increase the chance of developing pneumonia or other lung infections. It also mentions that masks do not cause hypoxia.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is unknown, explains that wearing a mask does not cause bacterial pneumonia, as the respiratory droplets exhaled into the mask are not a risk. Fungal pneumonia is extremely rare and would not be caused by a mask unless it is old and moldy. Masks should be kept clean to avoid any potential issues.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is unknown, is a study on the microbial contamination of used surgical masks in a hospital setting. It found that used surgical masks had higher bacterial and fungal contamination compared to indoor air samples. The predominant isolated bacteria and fungi were Staphylococcus spp. and Aspergillus spp.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-07-10, states that masks worn during the COVID-19 response do not cause fungal infections. It mentions that fungi are common in the environment and that people with weak immune systems are more likely to develop fungal infections.\n\nClaim: The mask grows fungi and bacteria that block oxygen and cause pneumonia.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is false. Multiple sources, including health scientists, infection preventionists, and the CDC, state that masks do not increase the risk of developing pneumonia or other lung infections. In fact, masks are designed to allow for gas exchange and do not block oxygen. The study (Information 4) on microbial contamination of used surgical masks found higher bacterial and fungal contamination on the masks compared to indoor air samples, but it does not suggest that masks cause lung infections. It is important to note that used masks should be handled and disposed of properly to avoid any potential issues.", "response": "FALSE."}

Let’s take a fresh look. ... The Defense Production Act was signed by President Harry Truman in 1950 and amended periodically since then. Broadly, it allows the federal government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n2 event in Wilmington, Del., Biden said, \"When it got up to March, I kept saying, look, you’ve got to invoke, and you remember, I think I was the first — I may be mistaken — person calling about the Defense Production Act. … Use that authority. Use it to go out there now and don’t wait to talk about the need for us to have masks.\" Biden said he may be mistaken, and he is. But Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which our friends at FactCheck.org rated skeptically. Since he has continued to say it, we will put it on the Truth-O-Meter.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-12-29\nTitle: Defense Production Act of 1950 - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe order gave USDA extraordinary powers to have firms maintain production. The order does not allow companies to ignore safety rules (except for keeping the plants opened), however, and OSHA / CDC guidance remains in force. In September 2020, OSHA fined Smithfield and JBS for failing to take the necessary actions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. On December 8, 2020, more than a month after losing the 2020 presidential election, then-president Trump said that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce vaccine doses, but he did not do so before the end of his term.\nIn January, 2021, President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act on his second day in office to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic, such as protective equipment. On March 2, Biden invoked the DPA again to supply equipment to Merck facilities needed to safely manufacture Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nIn March 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States, which includes lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese used by large-capacity batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles.\nOn June 6, 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate domestic production of green energy technology. The administration responded to growing energy costs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The invocation came along with a 2-year tariff exemption that ends in June 2024 on solar panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nThe Defense Production Act of 1950 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 81–774) is a United States federal law enacted on September 8, 1950, in response to the start of the Korean War. It was part of a broad civil defense and war mobilization effort in the context of the Cold War.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-01\nTitle: Defense Production Act Has Been Used Routinely, but Not With ...\nContent:\nBuilding an aircraft carrier or a frigate using priority ratings or saving a hundred thousand lives using priorities for ventilators?” said Larry Hall, who retired in August as the director of the Defense Production Act program division at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “If we used the president’s logic, most of our economy is already nationalized. But it isn’t.” · On Friday, the president said he had finally pressed the law into action to force General Motors to step up efforts to manufacture ventilators. Then the federal authorities raided the home of a hoarder in Brooklyn and his warehouse in New Jersey, invoking the Defense Production Act to recoup tens of thousands of surgical masks.\nInvoking the Defense Production Act is hardly a rare occurrence. As recently as last summer, the Department of Defense used it to obtain rare earth metals needed to build lasers, jet engines and armored vehicles.\nYet as governors and members of Congress plead with the president to use the law to force the production of ventilators and other medical equipment to combat the coronavirus pandemic, he has for weeks treated it like a “break the glass” last resort, to be invoked only when all else fails. “You know, we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month. “Call a person over in Venezuela, ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well.” · The Defense Production Act includes a range of authorities including issuing loans to expand a vendor’s capacity, controlling the distribution of a company’s products and the more commonly used power of compelling companies to prioritize the government’s order over those of other clients.\nWith General Motors, it is unclear what the act accomplished. The company had already announced its intention to collaborate with the medical device firm Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators. After the president threatened on Friday to invoke the Defense Production Act against G.M., the automaker announced that the venture would aim to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The Defense Production Act (DPA) is a federal law that allows the US government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency. It was signed by President Harry Truman in 1950 and amended periodically since then.\n* In March 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden claimed that he was the first person to call for invoking the DPA to boost manufacturing of high-demand health products, such as protective equipment.\n* Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which fact-checkers rated skeptically.\n* Biden was not the first official to call for use of the DPA to boost manufacturing of urgently needed medical supplies.\n* On January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden invoked the DPA on his second day in office to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic, such as protective equipment.\n* On March 2, 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA again to supply equipment to Merck facilities needed to safely manufacture Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n* In March 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States.\n* On June 6, 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA to accelerate domestic production of green energy technology.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim made by Joe Biden that he was the first person to call for invoking the DPA is false. Biden made this claim in September 2020, but fact-checkers had already rated similar remarks he made in mid to late March as skeptical. Additionally, Biden was not the first official to call for use of the DPA to boost manufacturing of urgently needed medical supplies. President Biden invoked the DPA on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022 to increase production of supplies related to the pandemic and to increase the production of minerals necessary for the clean energy transition in the United States. Therefore, the claim made by Joe Biden is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease. It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins. The study also predicts how a key entry protein is regulated with other immune system genes and reveals potential targets for the development of treatments to reduce transmission. Novel coronavirus disease -- COVID-19 -- affects the lungs and airways.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2001-12-01\nTitle: The effects of coronavirus on human nasal ciliated respiratory ...\nContent:\nHuman coronavirus (HCoV) accounts for 15–30% of common colds, but only one case report has described the effect of a coronavirus infection, that was asymptomatic, on human respiratory epithelium. The authors examined the effects of infection with HCoV on ciliary structure and function in healthy volunteers infected by intranasal inoculation with HCoV 229E.\n\nInformation 1, published on April 27, 2020, confirms the claim that the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, targets cells in the nose, lungs, and gut. The study mentioned was conducted by researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and other institutions.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 24, 2020, supports the claim as well. Researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard had been studying cell types in the human respiratory system and intestine, including the nasal cavity, lungs, and gut, where the virus has been detected. They found that the ACE2 gene, which the virus uses as a target, is critical in protecting people during lung injury but may also be exploited by the virus to infect cells.\n\nInformation 5, published in December 2001, discusses the effects of a different coronavirus (HCoV) on human nasal ciliated respiratory epithelium. However, this information is not directly related to the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and does not contradict the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered TRUE. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is most likely to target specific cells present in the nasal passages, lungs, and small intestine.", "response": "TRUE."}

Presidential Spokesperson Panelo said that the ceasefire starts on March 19, 2020, and will end on April 15, 2020.\nThe first ECQ and first MECQ were implemented between March 17 and May 31, 2020. This was announced on March 16, two days after the government of the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila under a \"community quarantine\" on March 14. It was implemented throughout Luzon from March 17 until May 15, and remained in areas with a moderate to high risk of infection until May 31.\nTV5 has also reorganized their television programming because of the ECQ.

Although the exact date of the publication of the claim is not provided, it is stated that it was posted on Facebook. The information published by the World Bank on Jan 27, 2021 (Information 1) and the report on the COVID-19 Low Income Household Panel and Economic (HOPE) survey (Information 2) suggest that the Philippine government has been conducting surveys and providing aid to low-income families affected by the pandemic. Information 5, published on Apr 26, 2021, also confirms that local governments provided aid to low-income families during the enhanced community quarantine, but many complained of the slow distribution of aid.

Despite similarities between bioweapons and natural outbreaks of viral diseases, the bioweapon conspiracy theories are easily invalidated.\nIn March 2020, the US Department of State summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest statements of a Chinese spokesperson, who suggested that the virus was brought to Wuhan by the US military, allegedly as a bioweapon.2 Then, a US senator suggested that the virus resulted from a botched Chinese bioweapons program.3 Palestinian media argued that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon being used by the US and Israel against China and Iran.4 Other US officials suspected that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory that was performing legitimate viral research because safety concerns had been previously identified at this laboratory.5 As time went on, concern grew because China was found to be censoring the results of research into the origins of the pandemic.6 It would not be the first time that modern research in China drew attack.\nIn late 2018, the announcement of gene editing of babies resulted in criminal charges against a Chinese biophysicist and his two colleagues.7 These issues have served to maintain alternative possibilities for the origin of COVID-19, based mostly on conspiracy theories and rumors that spread quickly through social media and remain difficult to stop. The virus as a bioweapon and the possible laboratory leak from legitimate research are the two most common remaining theories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2.\nIn 1977, the H1N1 virus was thought to have leaked from a Chinese laboratory.18 During the first outbreak of SARS in 2004, two accidental releases from a Beijing laboratory were reported to have occurred.19 In 1979, anthrax spores were released accidentally from a Soviet research facility near Sverdlovsk, Russia.20 These events provide some background for accidental-release theories for SARS-CoV-2.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-02-20\nTitle: Did a Chinese Intelligence Officer Reveal the 'Truth About the ...\nContent:\nA Chinese intelligence officer revealed that a new coronavirus was developed in a lab as a bioweapon. ...

This resulted in a shootout, the article claims, which led the bioweapon to be accidentally released near Wuhan, China.\nAll of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries. The article went on to claim that China, unhappy with massive protests erupting in Hong Kong, decided to make a biological agent that could make protesters more docile.

He is well known outside Spain for his \"Alatriste\" ...\nPérez-Reverte's novels are usually centered on one strongly defined character, and his plots move along swiftly, often featuring a narrator who is part of the story but apart from it. Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the Mediterranean. They often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea.\nPérez-Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper Pueblo and then for Televisión Española (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer.\nThey often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea. The novels frequently deal with some of the major issues of modern Spain, such as drug trafficking or the relationship of religion and politics.

Now even more evidence emerges casting serious doubts on the existence of the novel coronavirus which is reputed to cause the alleged new disease Covid-19. Dr. Derek Knauss, clinical scientist and immunologist-virologist at a Southern California laboratory, says he and his colleagues from 7 universities are suing the CDC for massive fraud.\nIn 2021 Samuel Eckert’s German Team and the Isolate Truth Fund offered a reward of $265,000 for any scientist who can provide incontrovertible evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated and therefore exists.

Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport. The information also highlights the testing strategy in Uganda, which tests all incoming travelers from high-risk countries, and the young age of most case-persons in Uganda.\n\nInformation 2 offers more context about Uganda's initial testing strategy, emphasizing the high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda. The information also highlights the risk posed by porous borders and the importance of strict border security and screening interventions.\n\nInformation 3 is a Wikipedia entry about the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda, including the confirmation of the first case on March 22, 2020, and the individual's travel history. The information also notes that Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nInformation 4 is a Reuters article from June 2021 about Uganda re-imposing a strict lockdown due to a surge in COVID-19 cases. The information highlights the closure of schools, suspension of inter-district travel, and other restrictions.\n\nInformation 5 provides an overview of Uganda's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the activation of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) in January 2020, the implementation of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan, and the development of the National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan in response to the delta surge.\n\nBased on the available information, the CLAIM that a photo showing Uganda's first case of COVID-19 was published on March 23, 2020, is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

You have been exposed to people who have it within the last 14 days. ... Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren't immune to the coronavirus, and because it has been mutating with new strains. If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies.\nIn January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant. Many clinical trials are underway to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones.\nImmunity is estimated to last up to three months. Having COVID-19 usually results in antibodies which should help protect you from re-infection. But the virus continues to mutate and these changes can lead to new variants which allow the risk for re-infection.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nOne paper published in the journal Science, led by scientists in New York, found that Covid-19 antibodies developed by the immune system lingered at stable levels for around five months. But two days earlier, a preprint study that has yet to be peer-reviewed, found that among hundreds of thousands of participants across England, antibody levels declined rapidly, falling more than 26 percent over a three-month period.\nBut waning antibodies could mean that Covid-19 survivors may be at risk of reinfection. A pair of studies released this week raised some confusion because of their divergent findings. One paper published in the journal Science, led by scientists in New York, found that Covid-19 antibodies developed by the immune system lingered at stable levels for around five months.\nAntibodies and other immune responses have been a major focus of coronavirus research because there are important implications for how long people could be protected before a vaccine is available. If antibodies confer immunity that is long-lasting, for example, people who have been infected may be protected until there is a viable vaccine. But waning antibodies could mean that Covid-19 survivors may be at risk of reinfection.\nMost experts agree that drops in antibody levels over time are expected, and that these declines are not altogether concerning.

The results may suggest that patients who had no detectable antibodies would be negative in population-based studies and results in falsely low prevalence rates. Since the declined antibodies may not be correlated with the neutralizing activity, we detected the neutralizing activity and S protein-specific B cells.\nTherefore, to aid in infection diagnosis and vaccine development, it is important to identify the dynamic characteristics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. We herein estimated the longevity of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a moderate COVID-19 patient, and reported that antibodies disappeared within 3 months after the onset of the symptoms.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated specific antibodies against SARS-CoV peaked at 4 months, and persisted for 2 years in patients who recovered from SARS [2]. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV antibodies can only identify some of the patients who had MERS-CoV infections, and these titers substantially waned within the first 6 months of illness [3]. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus of the Corornaviridae family. We herein reported that the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were disappeared in a convalescent COVID-19 patient within 3 months.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Antibodies against COVID-19 have been found to decline within a few months after infection in several studies.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibodies in COVID-19 patients declined sharply within 2-3 months after infection.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibody levels in COVID-19 patients declined by more than 26% over a three-month period.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibodies in COVID-19 patients declined to undetectable levels within 3 months after the onset of symptoms.\n* A study from 2020 found that neutralizing antibody titers declined over time in COVID-19 patients.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibody levels in healthcare personnel declined over a 60-day period.\n* A preprint study from 2020 found that antibody levels declined rapidly in the general population over a three-month period.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibodies in COVID-19 patients convalescent plasma declined sharply within 60 days after infection.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 disappeared in a convalescent COVID-19 patient within 3 months after the onset of symptoms.\n* A study from 2020 found that antibodies against SARS-CoV peaked at 4 months and persisted for 2 years in patients who recovered from SARS.\n* A study from 2020 found that Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV antibodies substantially waned within the first 6 months of illness.\n\nClaim: COVID-19 Antibodies Could Decline Within Months\n\nGiven the information above, the claim is TRUE. Multiple studies have found that antibodies against COVID-19 decline within a few months after infection. The decline in antibodies has been observed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and in healthcare personnel. The decline in antibodies has also been observed in convalescent plasma, which is being used as a treatment for COVID-19. The decline in antibodies has implications for interpreting serology results and for the collection of convalescent plasma. The decline in antibodies has also been observed in other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. The decline in antibodies does not necessarily mean that immunity is lost, as other parts of the immune system may also provide protection.", "response": "TRUE."}

However, there are a few ways to differentiate between COVID-19-related dyspnea and COPD exacerbation.10 COVID-19 patients may experience change in or loss of taste or smell.10 A person can develop symptoms between 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus.10 Since COVID-19 developments are rapidly changing, guidelines for vaccines and medications have yet to be approved.10\nIn fact, 8 out of 10 deaths caused by COVID-19 have been in adults 65 years and older.4 Additionally, adults 65 years of age and older are more likely to suffer from COPD; while the prevalence of COVID-19 is relatively low in COPD patients, individuals with COPD infected with the virus are associated with higher mortality compared to individuals without COPD.5 · Social distancing is a critical aspect that has heavily impacted how people interact to limit the spread of the virus in the community.\nA meta-analysis found that within COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 63% of patients that had COVID-19 symptoms reported them as severe, compared to 33.4% of patients without COPD.13 The results conclude that individuals with COPD are at a higher risk of developing more severe complications and higher rates of mortality due to COVID-19, compared to patients without COPD.13 Moreover, recent studies show that patients with COPD have a 4-fold increased risk of developing symptoms severe enough to require intensive care or mechanical ventilation.5 · Although COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system through minor damage to other organ systems, it has been found that acute myocardial injury and acute renal injury can occur in patients experiencing severe symptoms.14 In severe cases of COVID-19, patients may also develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may often require mechanical ventilation.\nRemdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and has been recommended in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 on supplemental oxygen who do not require mechanical ventilation.18 However, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not make a recommendation for the use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation.18\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The Complex Association between COPD and COVID-19 - PMC\nContent:\nThere is mounting evidence suggesting that COPD patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes; however, it remains unclear whether they are more susceptible to acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this comprehensive review, we aim to provide an up-to-date perspective of the intricate relationship between COPD and COVID-19.\nFurthermore, we review acute COVID-19 management, treatment, rehabilitation, and recovery in COPD patients and how public health measures impact their care. In conclusion, while the association between COPD and COVID-19 is complex and requires further investigation, this review highlights the need for careful management of COPD patients during the pandemic to minimize the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.\nA systematic review was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and mortality of chronic lung disease among COVID-19 patients. The review included 26 studies from China and three from the United States [31]. The pooled prevalences of lung comorbidities including asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were 3% (95% CI = 0–14), 2.2% (95% CI = 0.02–0.03), and 2.1% (95% CI = 0.00–0.21), respectively [31]. However, all of the studies included in the review were hospital-based, which may have resulted in a selection bias towards more severe disease.\nHowever, COPD was not found to be a risk factor for respiratory failure. COPD patients had the most co-morbidities, with hypertension being the most common. The pre-existing severity of COPD did not appear to influence the clinical outcomes of COVID-19, including length of hospital stay, need for intensive care, respiratory failure, or all-cause mortality; however, the number of patients with severe COPD defined by ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases) without spirometry confirmation was relatively small.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Coronavirus and COPD | University of Maryland Medical System\nContent:\nYou and your healthcare provider can work together to both manage your COPD and protect you from COVID-19.

Their lung tissues may be less elastic, and they may have weakened immunity because of advanced age. Treatment. “Treatment is the third factor,” he says. “A patient’s recovery and long-term lung health is going to depend on what kind of care they get, and how quickly.” Timely support in the hospital for severely ill patients can minimize lung damage.\nOur expert, Panagis Galiatsatos, M.D., M.H.S. discusses how smoking, vaping and air pollution might increase the severity of COVID-19. Learn about how each of these could affect a COVID-19 diagnosis.\nFor example, people living with diabetes, COPD or heart disease should be especially careful to manage those conditions with monitoring and taking their medications as directed.” · Galiatsatos adds that proper nutrition and hydration can also help patients avoid complications of COVID-19.\n“As we continue to learn about COVID-19, we’re understanding more regarding how it affects the lungs during acute illness and afterward. And this is especially true with the virus’ ongoing variants, as well,” Galiatsatos says. COVID-19 can cause lung complications such as pneumonia and, in the most severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* COPD increases the risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19\n* Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath\n* 80% of people recover fully from COVID-19 without medical treatment\n* Within COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 63% of patients reported severe symptoms\n* COPD patients with COVID-19 have a 4-fold increased risk of developing severe complications\n* Acute myocardial injury and acute renal injury can occur in severe COVID-19 cases\n* Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19\n* COPD patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes\n* Pre-existing severity of COPD did not appear to influence the clinical outcomes of COVID-19\n* People with COPD and other chronic lung conditions may be at risk of severe COVID-19 complications\n* Smoking cessation is a key part of COPD treatment\n* Smoking, vaping, and air pollution might increase the severity of COVID-19\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"COVID-19 affects COPD\" is true, but it requires further clarification. The COVID-19 virus can cause severe respiratory complications, especially in individuals with pre-existing lung conditions such as COPD. The information indicates that COPD patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute myocardial injury. Additionally, COPD patients with COVID-19 may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath and coughing.\n\nThe information also highlights the importance of managing COPD and protecting against COVID-19, especially for individuals with multiple health conditions and older adults. Proper nutrition, hydration, and smoking cessation can help patients avoid complications of COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with COPD and other underlying medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for individuals with COPD to take extra precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection, manage their COPD symptoms, and seek medical attention promptly if they experience COVID-19 symptoms. Healthcare providers should also closely monitor COPD patients with COVID-19 and provide appropriate treatment to minimize the risk of severe complications.", "response": "TRUE."}

Excess deaths refer to COVID-19 confirmed deaths as well as deaths that were not correctly diagnosed and reported.\nThe Economist reports that ‘Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines had negative excess mortality—fewer deaths than they would have recorded in a normal year, perhaps because of social distancing’.3 This researcher, however, argues that COVID-19 figures in the Philippines suffer from critical data gaps.\nCurrently, the country’s Department of Health (DOH) relies upon disease reporting units, local government units and health facilities to collate COVID-19 related data.

An Ethiopian child with malaria, a disease with an annual death rate of 619,000 as of 2021.\nInfectious diseases with high prevalence are listed separately (sometimes in addition to their epidemics), such as malaria, which may have killed 50–60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived. Ongoing epidemics and pandemics are in boldface. For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking.\nIf the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank. For the historical records of major changes in the world population, see world population. Not included in the above table are many waves of deadly diseases brought by Europeans to the Americas and Caribbean.\nAn epidemic is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time; in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic. Due to the long time spans, the first plague pandemic (6th century – 8th century) and the second plague pandemic (14th century – early 19th century) are shown by individual outbreaks, such as the Plague of Justinian (first pandemic) and the Black Death (second pandemic).

The study suggests that face masks could be effective in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-04, explains that face masks can help slow the spread of COVID-19.

Information 1, 2, 4, and 5 all provide evidence supporting the use of masks as an effective measure in preventing the spread of the virus. Furthermore, Information 4 directly contradicts the claim, stating that there is evidence supporting the use of masks.

Vaccinating them at this stage of the pandemic has limited public health impact. Countries can consider vaccinating this group based on disease burden, cost-effectiveness and other public health priorities. Children and adolescents at higher risk of severe COVID-19 (those who are immunocompromised, with severe obesity or with comorbidities) and never received COVID-19 vaccination should get one dose.\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners. However, prior to being vaccinated, inform the health staff administering the vaccine of any medication that you are taking. Each vaccine may have specific considerations for certain groups or health conditions, so it would be best to discuss with your health care provider about your specific situation. Do I need to be revaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine?\nSide effects of COVID-19 vaccines include fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. More serious or long-lasting side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines: the pandemic will not end overnight - The Lancet ...\nContent:\nA great achievement for sure, but this first step in what will need to be a global mass immunisation programme will not immediately end the COVID-19 pandemic. Although control over the infection's most harmful effects is expected and limiting its spread can be hoped for, it will likely be a few years before the virus can be brought under control worldwide. Ideally, multiple vaccines will be approved in most countries and we will have a detailed understanding of their efficacy, the duration of the immunity they induce, and their effect on viral transmission.\nAs cases and deaths continue to rise across the world, the non-pharmaceutical interventions to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that the global population has by now become accustomed to will need to remain in place for a while longer. ...

However, these countries should remember that the pandemic will really only be over when it is under control globally. International initiatives, most notably the COVAX Facility, are in place to support low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in establishing vaccination programmes and ensuring equitable access to vaccine doses. However, by Dec 16, 2020, COVAX had only secured about 400 million of the 2 billion doses needed to guarantee that 20% of the population of participating LMICs has access to a vaccine in 2021, while the EU, the UK, the USA, and Canada have already made deals with manufacturers to buy more than 50% of the doses expected to be available in 2021, despite these countries representing only \nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-03\nTitle: Get the facts about a COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine\nContent:\nFind out about <strong>the</strong> <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>vaccines</strong>, <strong>the</strong> benefits of <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>vaccination</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>the</strong> possible side effects.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International ...\nContent:\nDr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which co-leads COVAX, the global initiative for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, said: \"After more than three years of this pandemic, the world is ready to move to the next phase.

One of the enduring images from the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic was planes full of doctors arriving in New York City — then, the epicenter of the pandemic — to tears and rapturous applause. They came from around the country and around the world to support the city in a moment of need.\nPreventive measures are important, but it’s equally important to respond to a positive COVID-19 test. “You need to keep on the lookout,” Dr. Dweik urges. “If you don’t feel well, make sure you tell your doctor early because there are treatments now that weren’t there at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Those treatments can reduce the risk of hospitalization and the duration of the disease.”\nThose treatments can reduce the risk of hospitalization and the duration of the disease.” · On May 11, 2023, the Biden Administration announced the end of both the national and public health emergency declarations. While case numbers and death rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are declining, the pandemic isn’t over. Ending the emergency declarations simply means that the governmental response to the pandemic is scaling down. You can expect to see costs associated with vaccination, testing and treatment go up.\nFrom the beginning, the COVID-19 pandemic has looked dramatically different based on where you’re living and the information being made publicly available. Recently, China faced a major surge in COVID-19 cases — a side effect of lifting public health restrictions and poor-quality vaccines.\n\nInformation 1, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), provides information about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety, and side effects. It does not explicitly state that the pandemic is not over, but it does mention that vaccination efforts are ongoing and that non-pharmaceutical interventions will still be needed.\n\nInformation 2, published by The Lancet, discusses the progress of COVID-19 vaccines and the challenges of implementing mass immunization programs. It emphasizes that the pandemic will not end overnight and that it will likely take a few years before the virus can be controlled worldwide. This information suggests that the pandemic is not over.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2023, provides facts about COVID-19 vaccines, their benefits, and possible side effects. It does not provide information about the current state of the pandemic.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2023, states that the World Health Organization has lifted the \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" (PHEIC) status for COVID-19, but it emphasizes the need to continue protecting vulnerable people and managing COVID-19 alongside other infectious diseases. This information suggests that the pandemic is not over, but the global response is transitioning to a new phase.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2023, asserts that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, despite the end of emergency declarations by the U.S. government. It highlights the importance of preventive measures, responding to positive tests, and the continued availability of treatments.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and a vaccine is no longer needed is false.

The first is that “coronavirus” is not a word that only applies to the agent behind COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a subfamily in the grand classification of viruses. They include our current enemy, SARS-CoV-2, but also a different coronavirus that caused SARS nearly twenty years ago, and the coronavirus that produces the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nA French conspiracy video making the rounds points to a coronavirus patent held by the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Université Paris VII (EP 1 694 829 B1).

Smaller studies have shown that mouthwash and various other liquids commonly used to gargle can kill microbes, but whether gargling actually prevents or treats disease has not been proven in rigorous trials. Still, gargling is a common hygiene measure in many countries. In East Asia, particularly in Japan, gargling is strongly encouraged by the national government, along with other practices like hand-washing, wearing face masks and social distancing, as a matter of routine hygiene during the regular cold and flu season.\nThere is no firm proof that gargling prevents respiratory infections caused by coronavirus — or any virus or bacteria.

On 13 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply affected Brazil, the real reached a historical low against the US dollar, being negotiated at US$1=R$5.90.\nIn the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downwards path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation. Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies, and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies.\nThe Central Bank of Brazil is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994. As of April 2019, the real was the twentieth most traded currency. Currencies in use before the current real include: The Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis.

In a popular video swirling on Facebook, a local official in Pennsylvania casts doubt on the safety of face masks by arguing that a test he performs on camera shows that masks prevent people from breathing “the required oxygen level.”\nThe air is comprised of 21% oxygen, according to NASA, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, defines an “oxygen deficient atmosphere” — and therefore dangerous to life or health — as one in which oxygen falls below 19.5% by volume.

He concludes: “No matter what you choose — head sock, neoprene type fancy mask, cheap mask, N95, the best available — none of them allow you to breathe in the required oxygen level, which should be close to 21%.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nThe information provided consists of several sources that discuss a viral video showing a test with a gas detector that claims face masks result in dangerous oxygen levels for the wearer. All sources agree that the video's test is scientifically flawed. The video features a local official in Pennsylvania, named Neff, who uses a gas detector device to measure oxygen levels while wearing different types of face masks. The detector readings drop below 19.5% for oxygen, which Neff claims shows that masks prevent people from breathing \"the required oxygen level.\"\n\nHowever, experts and the gas detector's manufacturer state that the video's test is flawed due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The gas detector device is designed to measure gas levels in enclosed spaces, not while being worn on a person.\n2. Wearing a mask will cause the detector to read lower oxygen levels because masks cover the nose and mouth, causing the user to re-breathe some of the air they exhale.\n3. OSHA defines an \"oxygen deficient atmosphere\" as one in which oxygen falls below 19.5% by volume, but this definition applies to enclosed spaces, not to the immediate vicinity of a person's face.\n\nThe information sources include FactCheck.org, DenverNewsA, and other unidentified sources.

Amid a lack of evidence, many clinicians have defaulted to using dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker such as clopidogrel, which is the standard of care for similar coronary artery interventions, researchers said. But they stressed that there is no quality evidence to support use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people with PAD undergoing lower extremity revascularization.\n“People with PAD tend to be undertreated, yet they are at very high risk,” Hiatt said. “I hope that these data will lead to more education and improve how we care for these patients. From these unique data we see the benefit and risks of rivaroxaban plus aspirin were consistent regardless of concomitant use of clopidogrel. However, with higher rates of bleeding when clopidogrel is added to rivaroxaban and aspirin, these findings do not support the routine use of clopidogrel after lower extremity revascularization in these patients if they are on rivaroxaban and aspirin.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-06\nTitle: VOYAGER PAD: Clopidogrel Adds No Benefit to Rivaroxaban+Aspirin\nContent:\nCite this: Mitchel L.

The overall VOYAGER PAD results \"are practice changing for vascular interventions; it was by an order of magnitude the largest vascular intervention trial ever conducted,\" commented Sahil A.\nUse of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in this setting usually aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients who have just undergone lower-extremity revascularization is \"current dogma,\" even though it is not based on any direct evidence for efficacy, but instead came on the scene as \"an extrapolation from the coronary artery literature, where it does have some benefit, particularly after percutaneous coronary intervention,\" he explained.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Rivaroxaban and Aspirin in Peripheral Artery Disease Lower Extremity ...\nContent:\nConclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for acute limb ischemia regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use but with a trend for more International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding with clopidogrel use >30 days than with a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after lower extremity revascularization regardless of concomitant clopidogrel, with a short course (≤30 days) associated with less bleeding.\nBackground: The VOYAGER PAD trial (Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA Along With Rivaroxaban in Endovascular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for Peripheral Artery Disease) demonstrated superiority of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin to reduce major cardiac and ischemic limb events after lower extremity revascularization. Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization. Whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with symptomatic PAD undergoing lower extremity revascularization randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin.\nWith clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding within 365 days (hazard ratio, 3.20 [95% CI, 1.44-7.13]) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (P for trend=0.06).

According to the AACR here , the study found that the “enrichment of the lungs with oral commensal microbes was associated with advanced stage disease, worse prognosis, and tumor progression in patients with lung cancer.”\nDr Alison Morris, Chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine ( here ) told Reuters via email that: “There are no studies linking mask-wearing to changes in the oral microbiome” and that there’s no data to show masks “make those microbes more likely to end up in the lung.” She said that “one could argue that masks may decrease the risk of cancer since they make it harder for people to smoke.” · Dr William Nelson, director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins ( here ), also said that the bacteria referred to in the study are normally present in the oropharynx ( here ). “The best strategy for lung cancer prevention remains smoking cessation,” he added.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-02-24\nTitle: Fact check: Long-term face mask wearing does not cause lung cancer\nContent:\nCancer Discovery, Feb. 1, \"Lower Airway Dysbiosis Affects Lung Cancer Progression\" Reuters, Feb. 4, \"Fact check: No evidence linking masks to oral bacteria and to lung cancer; article refers to study that did not involve masks\"\nLeopoldo Segal, director of NYU's Lung Microbiome Program, found patients with advanced-stage lung cancer had greater amounts of oral bacteria in the lungs compared to early-stage patients. The presence of these bacteria were associated with decreased survival, poor prognosis and tumor progression. Nowhere is the impact of long-term mask-wearing or the relationship with lung cancer mentioned or alluded to. The writer of the article making the claim stated that relationship was his own personal view. There is no evidence to suggest masks, the only effective means to prevent COVID-19 transmission, instead cause disease.\nThe claim that long-term mask-wearing was found by one study to contribute to advanced-stage lung cancer is FALSE, based on our research.

Rather, the study examined how an increased amount of oral bacteria in the lower airway of lung cancer patients was correlated with a poorer lung cancer prognosis. Unsupported: No scientific evidence supports the claim that masks contribute to the development of cancer or change the microbial community in the airway of people who wear masks, as claimed.\nIn the Reuters fact-check, Alison Morris, a lung specialist and a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explained that: “There are no studies linking mask-wearing to changes in the oral microbiome”. She also stated that there’s no data to show masks “make those microbes more likely to end up in the lung”. Instead, “one could argue that masks may decrease the risk of cancer since they make it harder for people to smoke”. Overall, this claim grossly misrepresents the findings of a study on lung cancer and airway bacteria that didn’t involve masks at all to propagate a false claim about the health effects of wearing a mask.\nIn a fact-check by Reuters, the study’s corresponding author Leopoldo Segel, an associate professor at the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, explained: “There is no scientific rationale to suspect that mask wearing will increase the amount of oral bacteria that reach to the lung.” · He added that “the main source of these bacteria to the lung is the mouth and oropharynx [the part of the pharynx that is behind the mouth] itself,” and that amount of these oral microbes is influenced by oral hygiene and food intake. Generally, “they are going to be in the oral cavity of pretty much every individual.” · No scientific evidence supports the claim that masks cause cancer, nor is there a mechanism that would explain how masks would do so.\nOverall, this claim grossly misrepresents the findings of a study on lung cancer and airway bacteria that didn’t involve masks at all to propagate a false claim about the health effects of wearing a mask. Inaccurate claims that masks cause various negative health effects, aimed at discouraging people from wearing masks, have circulated throughout the pandemic; examples of these claims have been debunked by Health Feedback here and here. As this previous review by Health Feedback explained, scientific evidence demonstrates that wearing a mask can reduce the spread of viral respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Does wearing a face mask put you at higher risk of cancer?\nContent:\nFact check: No evidence linking masks to oral bacteria and to lung cancer; article refers to study that did not involve masks (Reuters)\nIt's true that oral bacteria can contribute to oral infections, dental plaque, and cancer.

The study mentioned in the misleading article did not involve mask-wearing and found an association between oral commensal microbes in the lungs and lung cancer. Dr. Alison Morris and Dr. William Nelson, both experts in the field, have stated that there is no scientific evidence linking mask-wearing to changes in the oral microbiome or an increased risk of oral bacteria reaching the lungs.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-24, is another fact-check by Reuters addressing the claim that long-term mask-wearing contributes to advanced-stage lung cancer.

Noel Celis/Agence France-Presse · Still, the W.H.O. left many researchers dissatisfied. Dr. Worobey and Dr. Bloom both signed a letter, along with 16 other scientists in May 2021, calling for more investigation into the origins of Covid — including the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 had escaped from a lab. The W.H.O. experts had identified 164 cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan over the course of December 2019.\nCollaborating with Chinese experts, the group released a report in March 2021 that contained previously undisclosed details about the market. They noted, for example, that 10 stalls in the southwest corner of the market sold live animals. The report also noted that 69 environmental samples collected from the market by the Chinese C.D.C. had turned up positive for SARS-CoV-2. But the frozen meat and live animals had all tested negative. A member of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team inside the closed Huanan market on Jan.\nAlthough the Huanan market was an early object of suspicion, by the spring of 2020 senior members of the Trump administration were promoting the idea that the new coronavirus had escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a coronavirus laboratory located eight miles away on the other side of the Yangtze River. There’s no direct evidence that the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was present at the lab before the pandemic.\nThere’s no direct evidence that the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was present at the lab before the pandemic. Researchers there have denied claims of a lab leak. But the Chinese government has come under fire for not being forthcoming about the early days of the pandemic. The report from the Chinese C.D.C. about the Huanan market’s samples, for example, had remained hidden. Starting in June 2020, two newspapers, The South China Morning Post and The Epoch Times, reported on what they claimed were leaked copies of the report.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-10-12\nTitle: The Mysterious Case of the COVID-19 Lab-Leak Theory | The New Yorker\nContent:\nThree years later, in the final days of 2019, Shi received samples from seven patients sick with a novel virus that was quietly ravaging Wuhan. Once Shi sequenced the virus, SARS-CoV-2, she scoured the W.I.V. databases for any evidence of a genetic match. The closest relative that she found, according to a paper that she and her colleagues published, in Nature, in February, 2020, was a bat coronavirus that was ninety-six-per-cent the same as SARS-CoV-2.\nThe chimeric viruses that the W.I.V. engineered are far from SARS-CoV-2 on the coronavirus family tree. According to Shi, the W.I.V. has only isolated and grown in culture three novel coronaviruses out of their nineteen thousand samples. What this chapter of her work demonstrates, however, is a high tolerance for risk. “They were essentially playing Russian roulette with the virus that the world’s expert had labelled poised for human emergence,” David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford, said.\nShe crossed another bat coronavirus from Yunnan—named WIV1—with clones of different novel spike proteins, and tested the creation in humanized mice. The viruses quickly replicated. One made the mice emaciated, a sign of severe pathogenesis. What made this work especially risky was that WIV1 was already known to be potentially dangerous to humans. Baric himself had made this clear in a 2016 study titled “SARS-Like WIV1-CoV Poised for Human Emergence.” · Some of these experiments at the W.I.V. were funded by the U.S. government, according to Shi’s published papers, as well as N.I.H.-funded grant applications and progress reports obtained by the Intercept.\nBecause they were working with novel bat viruses rather than viruses known to infect humans directly, the low biosecurity setting was in accordance with Chinese laws. But Susan Weiss, a coronavirus expert at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, who co-authored a recent paper with Andersen and others that outlines the evidence for a natural origin, was surprised when I told her that they had been working in BSL-2. “That’s not a good idea,” she said. Still, none of Shi’s documented work on chimeric viruses resulted in the creation of SARS-CoV-2.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The COVID lab-leak hypothesis: what scientists do and don’t know\nContent:\nTo obtain the best experience, we recommend you use a more up to date browser (or turn off compatibility mode in Internet Explorer).

Boosting mask wearing to 80-to-85% would dramatically drive down infections and result in fewer illnesses and deaths from COVID-19. “We need to remember to protect each other. Everybody has a grandparent or knows someone who is high-risk. Simply wearing a mask and maintaining six feet of distance from others works to reduce infections since we know that asymptomatic spread occurs,” Beckham said.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-02\nTitle: What We Need to Understand About Asymptomatic Carriers if We’re ...\nContent:\nIn an absence of an abundant supply of masks — which, by the way, also need to be worn properly to provide protection — both the WHO and CDC stressed how important social distancing was. “COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact with one another,” the CDC said in a statement. “That’s why the CDC recommends staying at least 6 feet away from other people, so someone doesn’t spread the disease if they are sick or are exposed through contact with someone who is sick.”\nAfter months of saying that healthy individuals should not wear masks, administration officials are now considering guidance for much broader, communitywide use of masks, Fauci told CNN on Tuesday. In an absence of an abundant supply of masks — which, by the way, also need to be worn properly to provide protection — both the WHO and CDC stressed how important social distancing was. “COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact with one another,” the CDC said in a statement.\nThrough their data collection, the team found that about 75% of people who were initially classified as “asymptomatic” went on to develop symptoms, she said. This matches up with the CDC’s findings at the nursing facility in Washington. Of the 13 positive patients who initially reported no symptoms during testing,10 later developed symptoms. But ultimately, the only way to really find out how many asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are out there would be to conduct blood tests across large swaths of the population to look for antibodies, which are a type of protein that provide evidence that a person’s immune system did battle with the coronavirus.\nShould we start wearing masks to the grocery store? At the same time, my colleagues were scrutinizing guidelines at various workplaces and agencies we cover: The New York City Fire Department told workers on March 19 they were to come to work, so long as they had no symptoms, even if they had had “close contact with someone who is a known positive COVID-19 patient,” according to a document obtained by ProPublica. Was that policy wise?\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-05-01\nTitle: Could You Be an Asymptomatic COVID-19 Carrier? Here's What You ...\nContent:\nRecent serosurveys in New York City that check people's blood for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 indicate that as many as one in five residents may have been previously infected with COVID-19. Their immune systems had fought off the coronavirus, whether they'd known they were infected or not – and many apparently didn't.\nBlood tests that check for exposure to the coronavirus are starting to come online, and preliminary findings suggest that many people have been infected without knowing it. Even people who do eventually experience the common symptoms of COVID-19 don't start coughing and spiking fevers the moment they're infected. William Petri is a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Virginia who specializes in infectious diseases. Here, he runs through what's known and what isn't about asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\nHere, he runs through what's known and what isn't about asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. In general, having an infection without any symptoms is common. Perhaps the most infamous example was Typhoid Mary, who spread typhoid fever to other people without having any symptoms herself in the early 1900s. My colleagues and I have found that many infections are fought off by the body without the person even knowing it.\nIt takes a little time for the immune system to rally that defense, so some cases are more aptly considered presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic. Everyone is on guard against the droplets that spray out from a coronavirus patient's cough or sneeze. They're a big reason public health officials have suggested everyone should wear masks.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Asymptomatic infection and transmission of COVID-19 among clusters: ...\nContent:\nCurrently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted in the asymptomatic stage; however, results suggest that asymptomatic infections are not limited to one population group (e.g. neonates, children, adults). In young people, it has been suggested that their strong immune status protects against COVID-19 severity.\nIn young people, it has been suggested that their strong immune status protects against COVID-19 severity. We hypothesise that asymptomatic carriers, either children or adults, should be vigilant as they are capable of transmitting COVID-19 during the incubation period without showing any signs or symptoms.\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis supports the notion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and person-to-person transmission and suggests that this is dependent on the varying viral incubation period among individuals. Children, especially those of school age (i.e. <18 years), need to be monitored carefully and follow mitigation strategies (e.g. social distancing, hand hygiene, wearing face masks) to prevent asymptomatic community transmission of COVID-19.\nFor minimising the spread of COVID-19 within the community, this study found that following the screening of asymptomatic cases and their close contacts for chest CT scan (for symptomatic patients), even after negative nucleic acid testing, it is essential to perform a rigorous epidemiological history, early isolation, social distancing and an increased quarantine period (a minimum of 14–28 days).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-27, is a fact-check by VoxCheck stating that asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers do not immunize other people and wearing masks is still crucial to reduce the transmission of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-11-05, is an article discussing the role of asymptomatic spread in community transmission of COVID-19. Dr. David Beckham, an infectious disease specialist, emphasizes the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-02, discusses the importance of social distancing and the changing guidelines regarding mask usage. It also highlights the need for proper mask usage and the limited understanding of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers at the time.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-01, discusses the possibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers and the importance of blood tests to identify antibodies. It highlights that many infections can be fought off by the body without the person ever knowing they were infected.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, is a systematic review and meta-analysis suggesting that asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers can transmit the virus during the incubation period. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring children and following mitigation strategies to prevent community transmission.\n\nClaim: The claim states that asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers immunize other people and, therefore, they should not wear masks.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim is incorrect based on the available information and current scientific understanding of COVID-19.\n\n1. Information 1 directly contradicts the claim, stating that asymptomatic carriers do not immunize others and wearing masks is essential to reduce transmission.\n2. Information 2 emphasizes the importance of following public health measures, including wearing masks, due to the role of asymptomatic spread in community transmission.\n3. Information 3, while not directly addressing the claim, highlights the importance of social distancing and mask usage, indicating that asymptomatic carriers may still transmit the virus.\n4. Information 4 discusses the possibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, but it does not support the claim that they immunize others.\n5. Information 5 suggests that asymptomatic carriers can transmit the virus during the incubation period, contradicting the claim that they immunize others.\n\nIn summary, the claim is incorrect, as there is no evidence that asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers immunize others. Instead, they can still transmit the virus, making it essential for individuals to follow public health measures, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing.", "response": "FALSE."}

During physical activity that was strenuous enough to increase heart rates by approximately 30 bpm, there were again no significant changes in gas exchange when wearing either type of facemask.\nFirst, our sample size is modest, though notably larger than many prior studies assessing gas exchange while wearing masks. Second, the duration of each study phase was 10 minutes, which was chosen to provide adequate time to observe physiologic changes but not require people to volunteer more than 90 minutes of their time. Though the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.\nThough the substantial increase in heart rate with walking supports that the duration and intensity were sufficient, future studies may consider a longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity.

If you are relocating to Peru any time soon, ideally, you should go for a private global health insurance policy that would meet your personal and family needs.\nPublic Peru healthcare system is too poor as compared to its North American counterparts. People often have to wait for months to get an appointment in a public hospital. Even for minor health issues, the waiting period is quite lengthy. It is a bitter fact that you can’t expect even basic healthcare in rural areas. Under-staffed and under-resourced clinics located in the outskirts are not the places you would like to visit during an emergency.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Peru - Medical Devices\nContent:\nPeru’s healthcare sector has five main entities: (1) MINSA is the primary publicly funded healthcare provider, serving 60% of the population through a network of public hospitals and clinics.

In 2014, there were 1,078 hospitals in the country, with 450 hospitals run by Regional Governments, 97 hospitals by EsSalud, 54 hospitals by MINSA, and 413 hospitals in the private sector. Peru has a decentralized healthcare system with five sectors administering healthcare.\n\nInformation 2 (No date): There is a shortage of healthcare providers in Peru, with doctors migrating to other countries for better salaries. This shortage leads to overcrowded hospitals, long lines at clinics, and extended wait times for treatment. In urban areas, patients may have to wait up to 40 days to consult a physician and up to 60 days for surgery. Peru has 16.43 hospital beds per 10,000 people, while countries like Japan have 130 beds per 10,000 people.\n\nInformation 3 (2020-08-01): Peru has undergone significant healthcare reform in the last 20 years.\n\nInformation 4 (2019-08-06): Peru's public hospitals, polyclinics, and medical centers are supported by the Ministry of Health and Social Security. Private sector healthcare includes hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and labs. Fees are charged for treatments in both public and private hospitals. The public healthcare system is poor compared to North American counterparts, and people often have to wait for months to get an appointment.\n\nInformation 5 (No date): Peru's healthcare sector has five main entities: MINSA, EsSalud, Armed Forces, National Police, and the private sector. There is one doctor for every 390 inhabitants and one nurse for every 368 persons nationwide. There are only two intensive care unit beds for every 100,000 persons and 700 intensive care physicians. The Government of Peru prioritizes improving the healthcare system, with medical services improving as the nation developed.\n\nClaim (2020-03-18): Peru has just nationalized hospitals and clinics.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim appears to be false. The information indicates that Peru's healthcare system consists of several sectors, including public and private entities. There is no evidence suggesting that hospitals and clinics have been nationalized. Additionally, the information highlights the decentralization of the healthcare system and the role of various entities in administering healthcare services.

From a primary impact point of view, men seem to be much more likely to have a severe form of COVID-19 or die from the disease.

Many have argued that there has been a power imbalance in the COVID-19 response, and that the insufficient number of female leaders places women at a disadvantage. For instance, the initial U.S. coronavirus task force consisted entirely of men until two women joined in February 2020.\nThe Lancet about the gendered impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, authors Clare Wenham and colleagues draw parallels with the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. “Women were less likely than men to have power in decision making around the outbreak, and their needs were largely unmet,” they say. “For example, [during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone], resources for reproductive and sexual health were diverted to the emergency response, contributing to a rise in maternal mortality in a region with one of the highest rates in the world.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The effects of COVID-19 on Sexual and Reproductive Health: A Case ...\nContent:\nMaternal mortality figures are available for some contexts; however, it is not always clear whether the rates reflect all deaths of pregnant women (including those who died from COVID-19), or only deaths caused by pregnancy complications. There has been a significant increase in maternal mortality in Colombia and the DRC, however rates appear to have improved in Burkina Faso compared with pre-pandemic figures.\nExperts also anticipated that COVID-19 would have an impact on health-seeking behaviours, with fears of contracting COVID-19 preventing women from accessing family planning, antenatal care, skilled birth assistance, and other essential reproductive, maternal, and newborn health (RMNH) services. This report reviews data from six focal countries – Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Syria in order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on sexual and reproductive health.\nStudies of previous health crises, notably the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the Zika epidemic in South America also indicate that where health systems lack resilience the indirect mortality effects (including maternal and neonatal mortality) of a public health crisis can be as significant as the direct mortality effects. While there appear to be no direct clinical outcomes among pregnant women due to COVID-19, initial projections anticipated that COVID-19 would inevitably cause a disruption of health services, with resources and personnel diverted from SRH to the public health emergency.\nAnalysis in English on World and 6 other countries about Health, Protection and Human Rights and Epidemic; published on 1 Dec 2021 by iMMAP\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2022-01-19\nTitle: Impact of COVID-19 on male and female reproductive health\nContent:\nA new review article investigated the relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection <strong>and</strong> <strong>reproductive</strong> <strong>health</strong>.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Effects of the pandemic on women’s reproductive health protective ...\nContent:\nSpending long hours in the crowded waiting rooms to receive healthcare increases the risk of infection transmission [13].

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease and a good model to further develop telemedicine [139]. With the new technologies including communication, mobility, environment interaction, and cognitive evaluation deployed in the telemedicine robot, ALS patients could get quality care from robot, which can be in turn improved by the pandemic due to heavily use and plenty of service experience.\nMoreover, according to the workers, the robot could talk to people in the native tongue which shows a considerable advantage in information transfer [131]. In the meantime, robots deployed in a hospital located in Texas, U.S., can perform repetitive chores to save the staff’s time for more important things. Moxi, a robot from Diligent Robotics, has been repurposed with new configurations in respond to the COVID-19 crisis.\nMany companies have migrated away from in-person interactions with customers and towards working remotely for employees (e.g., from home [8]) [9]. Although digital information can be transmitted virtually while people are isolated from each other, some necessary physical activities and resources are cannot be migrated online. Thus, robots could be of help in tasks like delivery and automated manufacturing (detailed in Part VI).\nWith these new technologies, the robot can not only perform many tasks as a standalone unit, but also help to share the information and build a complete network to better tackle this pandemic. Because of the above powerful capabilities, robots are found in every corner of the front line and have become our essential warriors in this battle against the COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Combating COVID-19—The role of robotics in managing public health ...\nContent:\nCOVID-19 could be a catalyst for developing robotic systems that can be rapidly deployed with remote access by experts and essential service providers without the need of traveling to front lines. Widespread quarantine of patients may also mean prolonged isolation of individuals from social interaction, which may have a negative impact on mental health. To address this issue, social robots could be deployed to provide continued social interactions and adherence to treatment regimes without fear of spreading disease.\nTo address this issue, social robots could be deployed to provide continued social interactions and adherence to treatment regimes without fear of spreading disease.

Even in such difficult times (or perhaps because of them) the majority of respondents believed that technology, robotics, and AI could help in minimizing the risk of contagion. The questionnaire also asked for applications where respondents thought technology could help. The responses were different, ranging from the use of robots to sanitize environments or to handle objects at risk to the deployment of technologies to facilitate remote work along with devices enabling faster medical testing and screening.\nThe questionnaire also asked for applications where respondents thought technology could help.

The authors found that women with COVID-19 experienced an increase in mortality, the need for intubation and ventilation, and ICU admission [78]. The study also found that women who had COVID-19 were more likely to be Black or Hispanic when Blacks and Hispanics make up only 12.4% and 18.7% of the US population according to the 2020 census [78].

How BAME women navigate maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a vigilant review of their needs on an individual basis. This is particularly relevant for hard-to-reach women, such as recent immigrants and asylum seekers, who may encounter difficulties accessing or engaging with maternity services. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess and highlight the challenges faced by pregnant BAME women during the pandemic.\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women in the UK have increased maternal mortality rates compared to other groups of women. Unfortunately, according to preliminary findings, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to mortality rates for BAME women, raising concerns that pregnant BAME women are facing greater health disparities during the pandemic.

In a correspondence piece in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Dr. Michael Xydakis of the Department of Defense, United States Air Force Medical Services Corp, and his colleagues highlight that it is not yet clear why or how COVID-19 causes someone to lose their smell.

However, their initial observations suggest that loss of smell “manifests either early in the disease process or in patients with mild or no constitutional symptoms.” · The authors of the new research wanted to explore further how the loss of smell as a COVID-19 symptom relates to the severity of the disease.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How COVID-19 Causes Loss of Smell | Harvard Medical School\nContent:\nThe findings suggest that infection of nonneuronal cell types may be responsible for anosmia in COVID-19 patients and help inform efforts to better understand the progression of the disease. “Our findings indicate that the novel coronavirus changes the sense of smell in patients not by directly infecting neurons but by affecting the function of supporting cells,” said senior study author Sandeep Robert Datta, associate professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.\nThe findings also offer intriguing clues into COVID-19-associated neurological issues. The observations are consistent with hypotheses that SARS-CoV-2 does not directly infect neurons but may instead interfere with brain function by affecting vascular cells in the nervous system, the authors said. This requires further investigation to verify, they added. The study results now help accelerate efforts to better understand smell loss in patients with COVID-19, which could in turn lead to treatments for anosmia and the development of improved smell-based diagnostics for the disease.\nTemporary loss of smell, or anosmia, is the main neurological symptom and one of the earliest and most commonly reported indicators of COVID-19. Studies suggest it better predicts the disease than other well-known symptoms such as fever and cough, but the underlying mechanisms for loss of smell in patients with COVID-19 have been unclear.\nTogether, these data suggest that COVID-19-related anosmia may arise from a temporary loss of function of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium, which indirectly causes changes to olfactory sensory neurons, the authors said.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-01-08\nTitle: Loss of Smell Associated With Milder COVID-19 Cases\nContent:\nA clinical trial currently underway is looking at omega-3 fatty acid supplements as a possible method to treat loss of smell.

However, this happened much more frequently in patients with a mild form of the disease. Researchers say the loss of smell isn’t due to nasal congestion, as in other seasonal respiratory illnesses.\nAsked why loss of smell might be more common in mild rather than severe cases of COVID-19, Overdevest said the large number of mild cases might have something to do with it. “Clarity on this association is limited by a number of confounding factors. However, a major limitation to drawing this conclusion is one of bias and statistics,” he said. “Where the sheer number of milder COVID-19 cases compared to severe cases provides a broader population of individuals to have experienced smell alteration.”\nThe impairment is usually a distorted sense of smell.READ MORE · There's a Respiratory Disease Outbreak in China, Why Experts Aren't Very Worried · China’s surge in respiratory illnesses, especially pneumonia among children, is most likely a result of the country’s extended COVID-19 lockdown…READ MORE · What We’ve Learned About Long COVID and How It Starts · New research suggests that cognitive impairment and \"brain fog\" observed in long COVID patients could be caused by diminished serotonin levels in the…READ MORE\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Loss of Taste and Smell From COVID-19 May Linger, Study Finds\nContent:\nIt is unclear how COVID-19 can lead to the loss of taste and smell, but Bhattacharyya mentions three possible reasons.

The second theory is that the virus causes inflammation around the nerves in the sinuses or nasal cavities. Lastly, it is possible that the virus attacks the blood vessels that connect to the nerves, cutting off circulation. Bhattacharyya says that there are no proven treatments for those who cannot recover their sense of taste and smell but, in his clinic, anecdotally, some therapies appear to help.\nLoss of taste and smell was more common with the early coronavirus alpha and delta variants, Dr. Bhattacharyya notes. It has become one of the less common symptoms of COVID-19 with the rise of the current omicron variant, according to VCU Health. It is unclear how COVID-19 can lead to the loss of taste and smell, but Bhattacharyya mentions three possible reasons.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Why Loss of Smell Can Persist After COVID-19 | Harvard Medical School\nContent:\nHe thinks the findings from this study could inform additional research into other long COVID symptoms such as generalized fatigue, shortness of breath, and brain fog that might be caused by similar inflammatory processes. Datta is also excited about the new avenue for research on smell that the study opens up. “These experiments define a kind of template that we can use to better understand how smell works in humans and how diseases like COVID-19 can cause changes in the sense of smell,” he said.\n“This paper allows us to look, for the first time, at COVID-19-associated smell loss in otherwise healthy people — a clinical condition that has affected millions in the United States alone,” said Sandeep Robert Datta, professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and an author on the paper. Loss of smell is one of the first symptoms that has typically been associated with COVID-19, said senior author Bradley Goldstein, associate professor in Duke’s Department of Head and Neck Surgery and Communication Sciences and the Department of Neurobiology.\nNew research has provided important insight into why some people fail to fully regain their sense of smell even months after recovering from COVID-19. The study, published Dec. 21 in Science Translational Medicine and conducted by researchers at Duke Health, Harvard Medical School, and the University of California San Diego, reveals that long-term loss of smell may be linked to an ongoing immune assault on olfactory nerve cells and an associated decline in the number of those cells. ... “This paper allows us to look, for the first time, at COVID-19-associated smell loss in otherwise healthy people — a clinical condition that has affected millions in the United States alone,” said Sandeep Robert Datta, professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and an author on the paper.\nScientists discuss what's next as SARS-CoV-2 evolves and why COVID-19 won’t be our last pandemic · MassCPR experts are weighing in on an evolving 'tripledemic' Goldstein added that many people who experience an altered sense of smell during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection recover within one to two weeks, but some do not. “We need to better understand why this subset of people will go on to have persistent smell loss for months to years after being infected with SARS-CoV-2,” Goldstein said.\n\nInformation 1, published on April 30, 2020, is a news article discussing a study that found that loss of smell may indicate a milder case of COVID-19. The study was conducted by Michael Xydakis of the Department of Defense, United States Air Force Medical Services Corp, and colleagues. They found that loss of smell \"manifests either early in the disease process or in patients with mild or no constitutional symptoms.\"\n\nInformation 2, although the publication date is not provided, is an article from Harvard Medical School discussing how COVID-19 causes loss of smell. The study mentioned in this information suggests that the infection of non-neuronal cell types may be responsible for anosmia in COVID-19 patients. The findings also offer clues into COVID-19-associated neurological issues and help accelerate efforts to better understand smell loss in patients with COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on January 8, 2021, is an article discussing a new study that found that 86% of people who have COVID-19 lose their sense of smell, and this happened more frequently in patients with a mild form of the disease. The study also mentions that the loss of smell isn't due to nasal congestion, as in other seasonal respiratory illnesses.\n\nInformation 4, although the publication date is not provided, is an article discussing that loss of taste and smell from COVID-19 may linger. The article mentions three possible reasons for the loss of smell and taste, including the virus attacking the olfactory nerves in the nose, inflammation around the nerves in the sinuses or nasal cavities, and the virus attacking the blood vessels that connect to the nerves, cutting off circulation.\n\nIn summary, multiple studies and articles provide evidence that loss of smell is a common symptom of COVID-19 and is often associated with milder cases of the disease. The loss of smell is not caused by nasal congestion, as in other seasonal respiratory illnesses, but rather by the virus affecting the function of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium. The loss of smell may linger even after recovery from COVID-19, and there are ongoing efforts to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential treatments for this symptom.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Loss of smell may suggest milder COVID-19, study finds\" is TRUE. The studies and articles provide evidence that loss of smell is a common symptom of COVID-19 and is often associated with milder cases of the disease. The loss of smell is not caused by nasal congestion, as in other seasonal respiratory illnesses, but rather by the virus affecting the function of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium. The loss of smell may linger even after recovery from COVID-19, and there are ongoing efforts to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential treatments for this symptom.", "response": "TRUE."}

The virus was confirmed to have reached Burundi on 25 March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

In the USA, death counts for COVID-19 between February and April 2020 indicated a similar male vulnerability (59% male deaths of 37 308 deaths) [22–24]. Altogether, our study yielded some evidence for a possible COVID-19-related hospital-based mortality trend for May 2020. However, this evidence needs to be treated with caution as the study has some limitations. On the one hand, our study was conducted over a period of 5 months of which only 2 months were after the confirmation of new COVID-19 cases in Burundi.\nHowever, from the time Burundi confirmed new COVID-19 cases (31 March 2020), there seemed to be an interesting trend. With a hospital death rate of nearly 13% in April, the figure sharply rose to about 22% in the following month. Most importantly, our findings suggested that mortality rate became significantly higher in May 2020 which could be considered as an onset of the pandemic in Burundi.\nWith a hospital death rate of nearly 13% in April, the figure sharply rose to about 22% in the following month. Most importantly, our findings suggested that mortality rate became significantly higher in May 2020 which could be considered as an onset of the pandemic in Burundi. Additionally, the study found evidence that time-to-death was much shorter in 2020 with patients dying in 6.7 days on average. Therefore, a combination of the above evidence i.e. date of appearance of COVID-19 new cases, sharp increase in mortality rate in the following month (May 2020), and the shorter time-to-death observed in the same period could serve as an initial warning of COVID-19 impact in the country.\nHowever, until late July 2020, only one COVID-19-related death had been officially reported earlier on 13 April 2020 [7, 8].

Immunity is protection against a disease, and it can be passive or active, natural or vaccine induced. Active immunity comes from being exposed to a disease-causing organism. Natural immunity results from being infected by a disease-causing organism, whether the infection is symptomatic or not. Vaccine-induced immunity results from being exposed to killed or weakened bacteria or viruses—or even just important pieces of them—through vaccination.\nBecause immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination. Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected. But a vaccinated person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection.\nCan you still get infected after being vaccinated? Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination. Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected.\nBy contrast, non-live vaccines typically require at least three doses to achieve protection that fades over time and must be restored with booster doses. ... Offer long-lasting, even lifetime protection. Could cause a life-threatening infection in someone with a weak or suppressed immune system.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How Vaccines Work: Immune Response and the Body's Reaction | Pfizer\nContent:\nVaccination, as well as natural infection, also help produce memory” B- and T-cells.5 That means if you become ill in the future with the pathogen you’re vaccinating against, your immune system is trained to protect you and prevent serious illness.\nDeveloping this tailored immune response is not immediate, says Gruber, who warns that it can take several weeks to build up enough antibodies to provide protection. Sometimes, he adds, people need to receive one or more additional doses of a vaccine to build a stronger and durable immune response.\nAll vaccines teach the immune system to create antibodies to help it fight off a particular pathogen.1 However, the method they use to accomplish this goal depends on the underlying vaccine technology. It’s a particularly exciting time for vaccine technology. We are seeing the opportunities that may come from matching different pathogens to specific vaccine technologies and shifting from traditional vaccines to mRNA vaccines in some cases.\nTraditional vaccines contain a version or part of the virus, bacteria, or other pathogen.1 It may be live but weakened, such as in the measles or chickenpox vaccines. Or, it might be dead or inert, such as in the pertussis (whooping cough) or tetanus vaccines.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: 10 Rumors About The COVID-19 Vaccines That Aren't True | Henry ...\nContent:\nThis experience has informed us that unknown, delayed side effects show up within two months of receiving the vaccine. These vaccines have been in use for many months, since the first vaccine trials were conducted over a year ago. There are no long-term side effects to worry about.\nHealth and wellness tips delivered right to your inbox. ... Three safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines are available in the United States: Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. All three have been put through rigorous clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy, and all three have been proven to greatly reduce the chance of contracting COVID-19.\nAlso, he adds, COVID-19 is similar to other coronaviruses we’ve seen in humans, like MERS and SARS, so there was previous research that could be used to speed up the process. “With vaccines, if there is going to be a complication or side effect (like an allergic reaction, for example) it will occur within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine,” says Dr.\nThese vaccines have been in use for many months, since the first vaccine trials were conducted over a year ago. There are no long-term side effects to worry about. “There’s no live virus in the vaccines, so they can’t infect you,” says Dr. Cunningham.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Common Questions About Vaccines (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth\nContent:\nNo, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chickenpox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or through a vaccine. Being vaccinated against one disease does not weaken the immune response to another disease. It's impossible to get the disease from any vaccine made with dead (killed) bacteria or viruses or just part of the bacteria or virus.\nOnly those vaccines made from weakened (also called attenuated) live viruses — like the chickenpox (varicella) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines — could possibly make a child develop a mild form of the disease. But it's almost always much less severe than if a child became infected with the disease-causing virus itself. However, for kids with weak immune systems, such as those being treated for cancer, these vaccines may cause problems.\nA lot of consideration and research went into creating the immunization schedule most doctors use, and it has been proven safe time and time again. Still, some parents choose to use alternative schedules (spreading or \"spacing out\" vaccines) because they're concerned about the number of shots their babies get at each checkup.\nBut vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases. They greatly reduce your child's risk of serious illness (particularly when more and more people are vaccinated) and give diseases fewer chances to take hold in a population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on September 27, 2023, by the CDC, explains that VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) reports do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for pregnant women and those trying to get pregnant. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain a live virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 24, 2023, by the CDC, explains how vaccines work and the difference between natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, and vaccinated people can still get infected, but the severity of the disease is significantly reduced.\n\nInformation 3, from Pfizer, explains that vaccination helps produce memory B- and T-cells, providing protection against a pathogen in the future. Developing a tailored immune response takes several weeks, and sometimes additional doses are needed to build a stronger and durable immune response.\n\nInformation 4, from Henry Ford Health, states that there are no long-term side effects to worry about with the COVID-19 vaccines, as they have been in use for many months with no unknown, delayed side effects. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States.\n\nInformation 5, from Nemours KidsHealth, explains that vaccines do not weaken the immune response to another disease and that it's impossible to get the disease from any vaccine made with dead (killed) bacteria or viruses or just part of the bacteria or virus.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim states, \"We do not need a vaccine. We need a body that can resist this and any other virus.\" This claim is incorrect based on the available information and current scientific understanding.\n\nVaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens. They help produce memory B- and T-cells, which provide protection in the future if the person encounters the pathogen again. It takes several weeks for the immune system to build up enough antibodies to provide protection, and sometimes additional doses are needed to build a stronger and durable immune response.\n\nThe claim that we need a body that can resist any virus is misleading. While it is true that a strong immune system is important for overall health, it is not possible for the immune system to be prepared to fight off every single virus without prior exposure or vaccination. Viruses are constantly evolving and changing, making it impossible for the immune system to be prepared for every possible variant.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is false. Vaccines are an essential tool in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and protecting public health. They work by training the immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens, providing protection in the future if the person encounters the pathogen again. It is essential to rely on accurate information from credible sources when making decisions about personal and public health.", "response": "FALSE."}

Lopinavir and ritonavir were reported to have in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV141,142. Alone, the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir had little therapeutic benefit in patients with COVID-19, but appeared more effective when used in combination with other drugs, including ribavirin and interferon beta-1b143,144.\nIn vitro data showed SARS-CoV-2 is even more sensitive to type I interferons than SARS-CoV, suggesting the potential effectiveness of type I interferons in the early treatment of COVID-19 (ref.150). In China, vapor inhalation of interferon-α is included in the COVID-19 treatment guideline151. Clinical trials are ongoing across the world to evaluate the efficacy of different therapies involving interferons, either alone or in combination with other agents152.\nPatients with COVID-19 showed typical features on initial CT, including bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution118,119.

One more huzzah should be added to the list: cancer survivor. Ginsburg was first diagnosed with colon cancer two decades ago, and over a period of more than 20 years beat it back. She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it. A decade later came a new diagnosis, pancreatic cancer, discovered early because the jurist was still undergoing regular screening because of her first cancer. In 2018, two tumors were surgically removed from her lungs, and then last year a new malignancy was discovered on her pancreas.\n\nInformation 1, published on September 23, 2020, confirms that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died due to metastatic pancreatic cancer.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 and has since spread to 27 countries, according to the World Health Organization.\nResearch evidence suggests that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats. SARS-CoV then spread from infected civets to people, while MERS-CoV spreads from infected dromedary camels to people. To date, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 which caused the COVID-19 pandemic has not been identified.\nIn January 2020, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The disease, later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread globally. In the first three months after COVID-19 emerged, nearly 1 million people were infected and 50,000 died.\nTo date, there have been roughly 45 million cases and 727,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. One of the troubling observations about COVID-19 is that people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 – some scientists estimate up to 40% -- can transmit the virus to others before they have symptoms or without ever having symptoms of disease.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19, SARS and MERS: are they closely related? - PubMed\nContent:\nSources: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics.

However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS.\nThis novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood.\nAlthough related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. Aims: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS.\nThere is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-08-27\nTitle: From SARS and MERS to COVID-19: a brief summary and comparison ...\nContent:\nMolecular tests such as polymerase chain reaction using viral RNA extracted from clinical samples have become the standard and primary diagnostic test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 due to its high sensitivity, specificity and simplicity [122, 130]. However, the sensitivity of serology tests such as antibody detection was generally lower than that of molecular tests and antibody detection was predominantly used in retrospective diagnosis for SARS and MERS [93]. Similarly, the slow plasma antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed, however, serological assay remains significant for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 because the combination of antibody test greatly increased the sensitivity of viral RNA detection in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 [131]. As presented in Table 2, the laboratory findings of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 patients are greatly similar, of whom the commonest abnormal laboratory findings are lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.\nThe imaging performance of viral pneumonia is almost overlapping, however, some specific differences exist as well. Although the chest X-ray/CT performance of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV, MERE-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, chest CT is preferred due to its high resolution, sensitivity and efficacy. As shown in Table 3, the commonest chest radiological performance of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 patients is multifocal or mixed ground-glass opacities, or crazy paving pattern in some cases, followed by consolidation, smooth or irregular interlobular septal thickening and air bronchogram [132,133,134,135,136,137]. Pleural effusion is rare or only occurs in severe SARS and COVID-19 patients, while it is common in MERS cases (roughly 33–50%). Pneumothorax and centrilobular nodules can be detected only in a few patients, whilst cavitation and lymphadenopathy are both rare or absent.\nAs shown in Table 4, pulmonary histopathological abnormalities of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases are non-specific. These changes result from direct viral cytotoxic and immunopathogenic effects. They are mainly characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which includes two categories, namely acute exudative DAD and proliferative DAD. Several SARS autopsy research showed that SARS-CoV could damage multiple tissues, however, the major histopathology involves lungs [55, 150, 151]. Different traits of DAD were observed during different disease stages [152]. Specifically, acute exudative DAD is the predominant pulmonary pathology finding of early period SARS.\nRecently, many researchers are focused on the application of cytokine-based interventions, including immune inhibitors (such as inhibitors of IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in the therapy of COVID-19, and some of these inhibitors showed enthusiastic results (such as IL-6 inhibitor, siltuximab) [90, 91], however, more studies are needed to further investigate the therapeutic effects of these inhibitors. ...

Biden and White House officials had wanted July to be a moment of reopening for the U.S. and a time for the economy to show signs it was moving past the pandemic. The virus hasn’t cooperated, and there are signs its resurgence comes with a political cost for Biden. Biden’s approval rating dropped to 50% in Gallup polling released on July 23, a dip from 56% in June. Biden is facing pressure from multiple sides.\nBiden is facing pressure from multiple sides. Americans of all political leanings are struggling to make sense of more than a year of morphing guidelines and rules. In the first weeks of the pandemic in the U.S., the CDC didn’t recommend face masks among the general public out of fear of a debilitating run on medical masks.\nWithout more Americans being vaccinated or continuing to wear masks, there could be more tough times ahead for Biden and for the country. “All the smug pronouncements have come smack dab into reality,” says Joe Grogan, who served as former President Donald Trump’s domestic policy advisor when the pandemic began spreading rapidly on U.S. shores last year.\nBeing vaccinated continues to be the best way to prevent dying or being hospitalized with severe disease when exposed to the virus, the CDC says. The uptick in cases and the new medical guidance on mask wearing has put Biden into a tough spot. Biden and White House officials had wanted July to be a moment of reopening for the U.S. and a time for the economy to show signs it was moving past the pandemic.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-21, is a fact-check by Reuters about a claim discrediting the Biden campaign for not wearing masks during a pre-pandemic campaign event. The event took place in Detroit, Michigan on March 9, 2020. Reuters confirmed the date through photographs and video footage from C-SPAN and ABC. At that time, the CDC recommended face-coverings only for those who showed symptoms, health workers, and caretakers.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-10-27, is a fact-check about a video showing Joe Biden without a mask after a campaign rally. The video was misleadingly captioned, implying that Biden didn't wear a mask because he thought he wasn't on camera. However, the video showed journalists with cameras nearby, and Biden put on his mask seconds after the clip ended.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-08-14, discusses Biden's stance on masks as a campaign issue and his criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic. Biden and Harris have used the mask issue to distinguish themselves from Trump and set an example for the American people.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-07-27, discusses the CDC's reversal on masking guidelines and its impact on Biden's presidency. The resurgence of the virus and the new masking guidelines have put Biden in a difficult position, as his approval rating has dropped.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that pre-pandemic footage was used to discredit the Biden campaign for not wearing masks is true, as confirmed by Information 1. However, it is important to note that the event took place before the CDC recommended face-coverings for the general public. Therefore, while the claim is technically correct, it lacks context and could be misleading. The public should be aware that the event occurred before the pandemic's severity was fully understood and before the CDC recommended masks for everyone.", "response": "FALSE."}

An abortion is defined as a medical procedure to end a pregnancy.\nThe number of abortions occurring worldwide over two days is roughly 400,000, based on annual estimates from between 2015 and 2019 from a study published in July 2020 in the journal The Lancet Global Health. Although the global number of abortions carried out over two days did exceed the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported in March 2020, when this claim surfaced, the number of deaths from COVID-19 has been growing steadily over time.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-01-13\nTitle: Abortion in the U.S.: What the data says | Pew Research Center\nContent:\nSince then, abortions have generally decreased at what a CDC analysis called “a slow yet steady pace.” · Guttmacher recorded more than 1.5 million abortions in the U.S. in 1991, about two-thirds more than the 930,160 it reported for 2020. The CDC reported just over 1 million abortions in 1991 and 620,327 in 2020, looking at just the District of Columbia and the 47 states that reported figures in both years.\nA quarter of women who had abortions in 2020 had one previous live birth, 20% had two previous live births, 10% had three, and 6% had four or more previous live births. These CDC figures include data from 42 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York). The vast majority of abortions occur during the first trimester of a pregnancy.\nIn 2020, 93% of abortions occurred during the first trimester – that is, at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to the CDC. An additional 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, and 1% were performed at 21 weeks or more of gestation. These CDC figures include data from 40 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York).\nSome examples included providing additional state funds for women’s travel expenses and for abortion clinics that were expecting more out-of-state patients. In the 46 states that reported data to the CDC in 2020, the majority of women who had abortions (57%) were in their 20s, while about three-in-ten (31%) were in their 30s.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality - PMC\nContent:\nMore than one-third of all pregnancies are unintended, and 1 in 5 ends in abortion. In developing countries, two-thirds of unintended pregnancies occur among women who were not using any method of contraception.9 Greater contraceptive access and use alone can thus drastically reduce safe and unsafe abortion by reducing unintended pregnancies.\nUnsafe abortion is thus a pressing issue. Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion—less restrictive abortion laws and greater contraceptive use—face social, religious, and political obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions (97%) occur.\nThe median rate of unsafe abortions in the 82 countries with the most restrictive abortion laws is up to 23 of 1000 women compared with 2 of 1000 in nations that allow abortions.4 Abortion-related deaths are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (34 deaths per 100,000 childbirths) than in countries with less restrictive laws (1 or fewer per 100,000 childbirths).1\nLess restrictive abortion laws do not appear to entail more abortions overall. The world’s lowest abortion rates are in Europe, where abortion is legal and widely available but contraceptive use is high; in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, the rate is below 10 per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-11-25\nTitle: Abortion\nContent:\nOf all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e., by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods.Developing countries bear the burden of 97% of all unsafe abortions. More than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia.\nMore than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. In Latin American and Africa, the majority (approximately 3 out of 4) of all abortions are unsafe. In Africa, nearly half of all abortions occur under the least safe circumstances (2).\nThe legal status of abortion can also affect children’s educational outcomes, and their earnings on the labour market later in life. For example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7).\nFor example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7). Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions (1); however, it does affect whether the abortions that women and girls attain are safe and dignified.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-09-25, explains that the claim is false. The number of abortions worldwide over two days is roughly 400,000 based on estimates from 2015-2019. However, the number of COVID-19 deaths has been growing steadily over time and exceeded the 400,000 mark in June 2020. Information 2, also published on 2020-09-25, confirms the findings of Information 1. It mentions that similar posts comparing the total number of deaths from COVID-19 with the number of abortions have circulated since at least March 2020.

Information 5, published on 2021-11-25, provides information on unsafe abortions and their impact on children's educational outcomes, but it does not contain information relevant to the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Information 1 and 2, the claim is false as the number of COVID-19 deaths exceeded the number of abortions over two days in June 2020.", "response": "FALSE."}

The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.
