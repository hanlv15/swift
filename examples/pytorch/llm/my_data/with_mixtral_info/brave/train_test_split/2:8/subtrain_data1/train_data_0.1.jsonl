UV light has been used for decades (yes, decades!) to reduce the spread of bacteria, such as that which causes tuberculosis, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nStill, it’s pretty damn impressive; UVC, which has the shortest wavelength and the highest energy of all the UV radiation, is a known disinfectant for air, water, and nonporous surfaces. So, when talking about UV light disinfection, the focus is on UVC, says Malley. Here’s why: when emitted at certain wavelengths and for specific amounts of time, UVC light can damage the genetic material — DNA or RNA — in bacteria and viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate and, in turn, causing their normal cellular functions to break down, explains Chris Olson, microbiologist and program manager of Infection Prevention and Emergency Preparedness at UCHealth Highlands Ranch Hospital.\n(Related: Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Skin Damage — Even When You’re Indoors) UVC rays, on the other hand, never actually make it to the Earth’s surface (the ozone layer blocks ’em), so the only UVC light humans are exposed to is artificial, according to the FDA.

Ultraviolet radiation has a shorter wavelength than visible light, but is longer than x-rays [1]. UV radiation is divisible into four spectra, based on its wavelengths, and these are UV (100–200 nm), UVC (200–280 nm), UVB (280–315 nm) and UVA (315–400 nm) [1,2]. UVC is the most effective at killing different types of microorganisms [3].\nUltra-violet (UV) C (200–280 wavelength) light has long been known for its antimicrobial and disinfecting efficacy. It damages DNA by causing the dimerization of pyrimidines. A newly designed technology (MUVi-UVC; Mobile UV Innovations Pty Ltd., Melbourne, VIC, Australia) that emits UVC at 240 nm is composed of an enclosed booth with three UVC light stands each with four bulbs, and has been developed for disinfecting mobile medical equipment.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on April 29, 2020, includes a statement from Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, a clinical assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University, who clarifies that there is no evidence that injecting UV light into the body will kill bacteria or viruses. However, UV radiation has been used for decades to reduce the spread of bacteria, such as that which causes tuberculosis, and can damage the genetic material in bacteria and viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate.\n\nInformation 2, the History of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation for Air, explains that public health concerns such as multi- and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis, bioterrorism, pandemic influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome have intensified efforts to prevent transmission of infections that are completely or partially airborne.\n\nInformation 3, Does UV Light Actually Disinfect and Kill Viruses?, explains that UVC radiation is a known disinfectant for air, water, and nonporous surfaces. When emitted at certain wavelengths and for specific amounts of time, UVC light can damage the genetic material in bacteria and viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate and causing their normal cellular functions to break down.\n\nInformation 4, Ultraviolet C irradiation: an alternative antimicrobial approach, discusses the potential of UVC irradiation as an alternative approach to current methods used to treat localized infections. It has been reported that multidrug-resistant microorganisms are equally sensitive to UVC irradiation.\n\nInformation 5, Efficacy of Ultraviolet Radiations against Microorganisms, explains that UV radiation has been used for many years to disinfect contaminated surfaces, as well as for treating infections. UVC is the most effective at killing different types of microorganisms.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that Ultraviolet Radiation is administered into the body as a disinfectant to kill bacteria and viruses and this has been used for a while now.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is false. The information provided explains that UV radiation is used to disinfect surfaces, air, and water, but there is no evidence or mention of administering UV radiation into the body as a disinfectant to kill bacteria and viruses. Additionally, a medical professional has stated that there is no evidence that injecting UV light into the body will kill bacteria or viruses.", "response": "FALSE."}

The 2009 H1N1 virus is not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal flu vaccine because it was identified after manufacturers had started making the seasonal flu vaccine.\nPersons who have some antibody from previous vaccination or exposure to infection with another related flu strain will have much greater increases in antibody to flu vaccines. Studies that looked at blood samples taken from children before the pandemic indicate that very few children had any measurable immunity against 2009 H1N1 prior to the outbreak Therefore, all children younger than 10 should get 2 doses regardless of whether they ever have been given seasonal influenza vaccine\nSo, increased activity from either seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 or both are still possible this season. For example, during the 1957-58 pandemic, flu activity dropped in December and January.

It was phase III clinically trialled in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey and relies on traditional technology similar to other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, another Chinese vaccine, and Covaxin, an Indian vaccine.\nCoronaVac is being used in vaccination campaigns in various countries in Asia, South America, Central America, and Eastern Europe. By April 2021, Sinovac had a production capacity of 2 billion doses per year. It is currently being manufactured at several facilities in China, with overseas manufacture planned for Brazil in September 2021 and eventually Egypt and Hungary.\nIn July 2020, Sinovac began Phase III trials to evaluate efficacy and safety on 9,000 volunteer healthcare professionals in Brazil, collaborating with Butantan Institute. On 19 October, São Paulo Governor João Doria said the first results of the clinical study conducted in Brazil proved that among the vaccines being tested in the country, CoronaVac is the safest, the one with the best and most promising immunization rates.\nIn early January 2021, Brazilian health officials announced that the vaccine had an efficacy of 78%. One week later, they revised this figure to 50.4%, stating that the revised figure now included \"very mild\" cases of COVID-19 among trial participants which were omitted in the earlier analysis. Ricardo Palácios, medical director of Brazil's Instituto Butantan, said Sinovac's relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to more rigorous standards for what counted as an infection among trial participants.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-03-08\nTitle: Exclusive: Study in Brazil indicates Sinovac vaccine works against ...\nContent:\nPreliminary data from a study <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong> indicates that the COVID-19 <strong>vaccine</strong> developed by China&#x27;s <strong>Sinovac</strong> Biotech Ltd is effective against the P1 variant of the virus first discovered <strong>in</strong> <strong>Brazil</strong>, a source familiar with the study told Reuters on Monday.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a date, is about a city in Brazil using the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains the CDC's H1N1 flu vaccine, including its name and the fact that it doesn't indicate how long the vaccine will work or the year it should be administered.

Multiple research studies and news reports show that patients were kept on ventilators in Italy, and there is no specific medicinal cure available yet.\n3. A video from May 26, 2020, claims that Italian doctors discovered that the coronavirus is not a virus but a bacteria causing blood clots, which can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants. However, this information is not accurate.\n4. A lengthy text message from June 11, 2020, making similar claims about Italy finding the cure for the coronavirus was fact-checked and found to be false.\n5. A fact-check article from May 1, 2020, states that the coronavirus is a virus, not a bacterium, and there is no evidence to support the claim that aspirin can cure or treat COVID-19.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that Italy has found the cure for the coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including Poynter, the Press Information Bureau (India), and various fact-checking articles, have debunked this claim. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, and while symptoms can be treated, there is no cure available at this time.

Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.\nNICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.

NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.\nThe fascination with vitamin D supplementation began with the discovery in the early 1920s that vitamin D prevented rickets and was further driven by the recognition of other potential roles of vitamin D in non-skeletal outcomes, including immune function, cardiovascular health, and cancer. However, whereas data on the function of vitamin D in bone growth and maintenance is clear-cut and has informed practical clinical guidelines and public health policies over the years, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in other health and disease processes, in particular in acute respiratory tract infection, remains patchy.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D may not protect against COVID-19, as previously ...\nContent:\nBut there is still not enough evidence that taking supplements can prevent or treat COVID-19 in the general population. “Most vitamin D studies are very difficult to interpret since they cannot adjust for the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as older age or having chronic diseases, which are also predictors of low vitamin D,” says co-author Guillaume Butler-Laporte, a physician and a fellow under the supervision of Professor Brent Richards at McGill University.\nWhile previous research early in the pandemic suggested that vitamin D cuts the risk of contracting COVID-19, a new study from McGill University finds there is no genetic evidence that the vitamin works as a protective measure against the coronavirus. \"Vitamin D supplementation as a public health measure to improve outcomes is not supported by this study. Most importantly, our results suggest that investment in other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be prioritized for COVID-19 randomized clinical trials,\" say the authors.\nFuture studies are needed to explore the relationship with vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes in other populations, say the researchers. “In the past Mendelian randomization has consistently predicted results of large, expensive, and timely vitamin D trials.

It adds substantial further material claiming to provide evidence for these dangers and calls for better regulation from the European Union, as well as asking for donations to support the running of its site.\nEventually taken down by YouTube, but also republished through other video sharing sites, the video reached some 224 spaces with at least 2.8 million followers; Icke also released a further video, repeating claims that COVID-19 itself did not exist and that 5G was instead preventing human bodies from absorbing oxygen, thus causing COVID-like symptoms. Posted on the video sharing site Vimeo on 7 April, the video reached some 229 spaces with at least 4.3 million followers before it was taken down. The conspiracy theory takes an even stranger turn with a post and accompanying videos that purport to present revelations by ‘a former executive of Vodafone’ in the United Kingdom, outlining the supposed dangers of the technology that Vodafone – ‘in partnership with Huawei’ – is now installing in the United Kingdom.\nFrom 22 March, a variety of posts in Italian also circulate widely; this is very likely prompted by the shutdown of all non-essential businesses and total domestic travel ban announced late on 21 March by Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte (Safi et al., 2020). An article in the alternative health site Oasi Sana (Healthy Oasis) points to tweets by the Belgian economist Gunter Pauli, allegedly an economic advisor to the Italian Prime Minister, that repeat the claim that Wuhan was the first location in the world to roll out 5G technology and add a further claim that northern Italy, which saw the country’s worst COVID-19 outbreak, was the first European region to deploy 5G; an article in Affari Italiani (Italian Affairs), now deleted, similarly connects COVID-19, vaccines and 5G; and a lengthy Facebook video by the journalist Nicola Porro, raging against the new lockdown restrictions although he tested positive for COVID-19 himself, is shared widely especially among supporters of the fa\nFocussing in detail on one key component of the infodemic surrounding COVID-19, this article traces the dissemination dynamics of rumours that the pandemic outbreak was somehow related to the rollout of 5G mobile telephony technology in Wuhan and around the world.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-24\nTitle: The conspiracy theory about 5G causing coronavirus, explained - Vox\nContent:\nThe loose and incorrect reasons some have connected 5G technology to the coronavirus outbreak are myriad and maddening. Some seem to think that both 5G and the coronavirus are new, so they must be connected somehow. Others point to suspicious sources like misunderstood legislation as evidence that the government is hiding something in this global crisis.\nMany of the sites that promoted 5G conspiracy theories are now steering their audiences toward the 5G coronavirus connection. The “uncensored health news” website Natural News, for example, has long warned of the supposed dangers of 5G technology. Lately, the site has run headlines like: “Did the 5G rollout in Wuhan damage the innate cellular defense cells of the population, putting the people at risk of complications and death from coronavirus?”\nThe theory posits that Bill Gates not only caused the outbreak but also, somehow, used 5G to do it. One tweet identified by Recode, which has garnered thousands of likes and retweets, falsely posits the alleged Bill Gates connection and finds it suspicious that Facebook is blocking accounts that share information about the 5G coronavirus conspiracy.\nBy early April, conspiracy theorists were setting cell towers on fire in Europe and starting to intersect with other conspiracy-minded communities like anti-vaxxers, raising fears that the towers could pose a threat to public health. In the face of these fears, it remains unclear if the platforms where these ideas are spreading — Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube — can do anything to stop the madness.

What makes this even more surprising is that 5G technology isn’t brand new. Rather, it’s a continued development, based on international standards, of the communication technologies preceding it, like 4G.\nBut, the team was surprised that there seems to be a consistent, global misunderstanding of 5G technology.

Instead, this theory claims that the radiation from 5G is what’s actually causing COVID-19 symptoms. Another variation of the conspiracy theory asserts that radiation from 5G can weaken your immune system to the point that you are more easily infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nFor example, if you were to map out the number of times people laugh and fart at the same time, which incidentally is called “larting,” you’d probably see a similar geographic distribution. Why? Is larting somehow causing COVID-19? Or do 5G towers go up every time enough larting occurs? No, because there is at least one big confounder at play here that is driving these three things: population density. Places in the U.S. with more people are more likely to have more 5G towers just because more people means more telecommunications demand.\nIndeed, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that RF fields to be “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” And the EPA does say on its website: “When RF energy is very strong, such as from radar transmitters, it can be dangerous. It can heat parts of your body very rapidly and cause serious injuries, like severe burns.” · However, before you freak out about 5G, consider what else the EPA says on its website: “These extremely high RF energy levels are only found near powerful equipment, such as long-distance transmitters.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-01-26, states that there is no proof for the claim that the roll-out of 5G is causing the coronavirus or coronavirus-like symptoms.

(March 31) New Jersey Chief Justice Stuart Rabner signed an order calling for the temporary release of 1,000 people from jails(almost a tenth of the entire state’s county jail population) across the state of New Jersey who were serving county jail sentences for probation violations, municipal court convictions, “low-level indictable crimes,” and “disorderly persons offenses.” (March 23)\nFollowing a ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on April 3rd, which made people held for technical probation/parole violations eligible for release hearings, 13 people were released and 58 people were paroled from state prisons. In addition, 23 requests for medical parole were approved. (April 14) Maryland Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera ordered the state’s trial courts to identify and release people in prisons who are at risk for COVID-19 and “pose no threat to public safety.” (April 14)\nAnd yet state prisons are filled with people with preexisting medical conditions that put them a heightened risk for complications from COVID-19. So far, we are aware of these state officials taking steps to reduce the prison population in the face of the pandemic: The New Jersey legislature passed a bill (S2519) on October 19th, signed shortly after by Governor Phil Murphy, that allowed for people with less than a year left on their sentences to be released up to eight months early.

Under the ruling, San Quentin can house no more than 1,775 people – a steep reduction from the 2,900 people at the facility at the time of the decision.\nIn an analysis of state and federal court records and data and interviews with prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys and court administrators, the New York Times found that dozens of incarcerated people died behind bars this year after being approved for release by a parole board or while being held in jail without a conviction.

The virus entering into cell by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and use the host cell’s machinery to reproduce and contaminate new host cells. Nano-based materials could help in: (i) enhanced the speed and sensitivity of virus detection; (ii) help in the development of more efficient and safer treatment and vaccines and (iii) improve the safety of healthcare workers through the development of nano-based Personal Protective equipment (PPE)\nAmid the pandemic, we have witnessed rapid progress in the development of different diagnostic kits for COVID-19. However, the race continues and nanosensors are an integral part of this process in the search for new solutions and have contributed significantly to the process of translating in vitro systems into in vivo systems [119]. The effect of the corona protein, which is when the surface of nanoparticles in the medium of biological fluids is quickly covered by a selected group of biomolecules, has been extensively investigated for these nanosensors.\nIn this context, the future for these nanotechnology-based systems is to explore the integration of various properties (optical, magnetic, electrochemical and biological) to promote a more precise and fast response for the diagnosis [121]. As demonstrated throughout this topic, nanotechnology has been extensively investigated in the development of new detection systems.

In this short review, we discuss how nanotechnology offers new ways to combat COVID-19, and how nanomaterials can be applied to control the COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn this short review, we discuss how nanotechnology offers new ways to combat COVID-19, and how nanomaterials can be applied to control the COVID-19 outbreak. We also summarize relevant studies regarding the use of nanomaterials for preventing viral spread, preparing vaccines, and diagnosing coronavirus, as well as studies that show how nanoparticles can be used as drug delivery systems for the treatment of viral infections.\nAs a result of their nanoscale structure, such nanomaterials display unique and excellent optical, electrical, and biological performances [9, 10]. Nanotechnology, and nanomaterials in particular, can offer new applications in biomedicine, such as intelligent and controlled drug delivery, or diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, including viral infections [11]. Currently, thousands of laboratories around the world are involved in working to develop preventative measures and treatments for COVID-19. The results of these research efforts have revealed various biomedical applications of nanomaterials; for example, filters with nanometer coatings, vaccines with nanometer adjuvants, drug delivery systems prepared with nanometer carries, and medical apparatus and instruments, among others.\nOn May 16th, 2020, the first batch of COVID-19 patient volunteers was injected with the mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) developed by Moderna; this vaccine technology employed lipid encapsulation, and the project has now entered the emergency use in several countries [66]. Meanwhile, researchers found that polymeric nano-adjuvants were effective for preparing hepatitis B and Newcastle disease vaccines because of their slow antigen release and high biocompatibility.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2022-06-27\nTitle: Nanotechnology for the management of COVID-19 during the pandemic ...\nContent:\nWith several highly effective COVID-19 vaccines deployed at scale in many countries, an important question is whether the use of nanotechnology in vaccines provides the necessary ability to rapidly redesign vaccines when concerning variants appear that are more virulent. Outlined below are the major advantages of mRNA delivered in lipid nano-carriers. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, new variants of concern are being generated with altered virulence and transmissibility, resulting in altered levels of protection from existing vaccines [95]. The Omicron variant has shown a particularly rapid global spread and has replaced Delta as the most prevalent variant.\nThe power of nanotechnology-driven detection such as the LFA and nanopore sequence can be further explored to manage COVID-19 and other potential virus diseases. During this pandemic, lipid nanoparticles for delivering mRNA in vaccines have played a major role in population-level vaccination strategies, and will likely play an increasing role in the future, both as a platform for the rapid development of vaccines, and for updating vaccines to address viral mutations. New nanoparticles with higher antigen-delivery efficiency, better stability, especially thermal stability, and target delivery are desired for vaccines.\nIn this review, we discuss the role of nanotechnology in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and its role in the post-pandemic era. We discuss nanotechnology as applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development and the development of antiviral medicines.\nWithin weeks after the first published report of COVID-19, the full sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome had been determined, and it was shared globally, informing the development of vaccines and medicines. Nanoscale features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were characterized using cryo-electron microscopy [7,8]. These analyses revealed that for viral entry into human cells, the viral spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and this is followed by membrane fusion of the viral envelope and the host cell membrane.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 discuss the potential of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in preventing, diagnosing, and treating COVID-19.

The drugs in question — hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — are among a number of medications being studied as part of a global effort to fight COVID-19. So far, experts say evidence of their effectiveness in treating the disease is thin. Hydroxychloroquine is currently used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, while azithromycin is an antibiotic for infections caused by bacteria and can be used in treating bacterial pneumonia.\nExcept when there is a clinical trial, the statement instructs both doctors and pharmacists not to provide the drugs as a treatment for COVID-19. Giontsis confirms he saw an initial rush of orders for azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, including some requests from doctors labelled 'for office use.'\nGiontsis confirms he saw an initial rush of orders for azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, including some requests from doctors labelled 'for office use.'

It is allowed for doctors to decide if the treatment is appropriate for their patients.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-27, discusses a surge in demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine due to President Donald Trump promoting them as possible treatments for COVID-19. The American Medical Association requested that doctors cease writing prescriptions for themselves and their families.

Based on the information available, this claim is generally true. However, there are exceptions, such as the Maine doctor mentioned in Information 4, who faced the loss of her license for prescribing hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to COVID-19 patients. Information 5 also indicates that medical regulators in Canada can sanction doctors for prescribing unproven COVID-19 drugs like hydroxychloroquine to themselves or friends and family. Therefore, while the claim is generally accurate, there are specific circumstances where doctors could potentially face consequences for their prescribing practices related to hydroxychloroquine.", "response": "FALSE."}

Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19.\nRecent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. We used observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death.\nNonetheless, race and ethnicity cannot fully capture ancestry, so the associations between blood types and COVID-19 we report may still be confounded by ancestry, even after adjustment. Further work is needed to better understand any potential residual confounding due to ancestry, not captured by race and ethnicity. In this study we found evidence for associations between ABO and Rh blood groups and COVID-19. Using data from NYP/CUIMC, we found moderately increased infection prevalence among non-O blood types and among Rh-positive individuals. Intubation risk was increased among AB and B types, and decreased among A and Rh-negative types.\nRisk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B.

In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognise the term \"Rohingya\" and prefers to refer to the community as \"Bengali\".\nSince 2015, over 900,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to south-eastern Bangladesh alone, and more to other surrounding countries, and major Muslim nations. More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar are confined in camps for internally displaced persons. Shortly before a Rohingya rebel attack that killed 12 security forces on 25 August 2017, the Myanmar military launched \"clearance operations\" against the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state that, according to NGOs, the Bangladeshi government and international news media, left many dead, and many more injured, tortured or raped, with villages burned.\nThe Rohingya refer to themselves as Ruáingga /ɾuájŋɡa/. In Burmese they are known as rui hang gya (following the MLC Transcription System) (Burmese: ရိုဟင်ဂျာ /ɹòhɪ̀ɴd͡ʑà/) while in Bengali they are called Rohingga (Bengali: রোহিঙ্গা /ɹohiŋɡa/).

The genocide has consisted of two phases to date: the first was a military crackdown that occurred from October 2016 to January 2017, and the second has been occurring since August 2017.\nThe persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar dates back to at least the 1970s. Since then, the Rohingya people have been persecuted on a regular basis by the government and Buddhist nationalists. In late 2016, Myanmar's armed forces and police launched a major crackdown against the people in Rakhine State which is located in the country's northwestern region.\nThe population of the western coastal province of Rakhine State is predominantly Buddhist Rakhine (4% of Myanmar's total population, about 2 million people) while the Rohingya (2% of Myanmar's total population, about 1 million people) are predominantly Muslim.\nTensions between Buddhist and Muslim communities have frequently led to violence in Rakhine State, with nationalist Buddhists often targeting Rohingyas.

When violence resumed in October, it engulfed nine more townships and became a coordinated campaign to forcibly relocate or remove the state’s Muslims.\nThe October attacks were against Rohingya and Kaman Muslim communities and were organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces. Rohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed.\nRohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed. While the state security forces in some instances intervened to prevent violence and protect fleeing Muslims, more frequently they stood aside during attacks or directly supported the assailants, committing killings and other abuses.\nThe violence since June displaced at least 125,000 Rohingya and other Muslims, and a smaller number of Arakanese, to internally displaced person (IDP) camps. Many of the displaced Muslims have been living in overcrowded camps that lack adequate food, shelter, water and sanitation, and medical care.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by Human Rights Watch, details the history of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, a Muslim minority group that has faced systematic abuses and persecution by the Myanmar military and Buddhist nationalists. The Rohingya have been denied citizenship and face restrictions on their freedom of movement, access to food, healthcare, education, and livelihoods. The Myanmar government does not recognize the term \"Rohingya\" and instead refers to the community as \"Bengali.\"\n\nInformation 2, published by The New York Times, discusses a study on how doctors and nurses can accommodate the needs of Muslim patients within the traditional healthcare system, particularly in relation to their religious practices.\n\nInformation 3, published in the Wikipedia article on Rohingya people, provides information on the Rohingya's self-identified name, their history, and the ongoing Rohingya genocide.\n\nInformation 4, published in the Wikipedia article on the Rohingya genocide, details the history of persecution against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, dating back to the 1970s.

Although there are also studies that reported to have no benefit for using chloroquine on COVID-19 patients and documented increased risk of cardiotoxicity [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Notably, chloroquine is an ionophore for zinc and could increase the cellular entry of zinc [46]. Additionally, intracellular antiviral effects of zinc might be partly related to the chloroquine-induced beneficial effects documented in COVID-19 patients. In a recent clinical observation, zinc sulfate, in combination with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, has shown to provide better therapeutic benefits to the COVID-19 infected patients than the patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, without zinc; an increased frequency of hospital discharge and reduced mortality are documented in zinc sulfate added-COVID-19 patients [47]. \nThe zinc-binding sites were shown to be conserved in RdRp and 3CLpro by molecular modeling [20]. Though exact mechanisms are not yet defined, zinc-binding can reduce the enzymatic activities of 3CLpro and RdRp to inhibit viral replication [19]. In vitro studies have claimed that low zinc levels favor viral multiplication in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells [21]. Similarly, zinc could markedly inhibit the replication potential of the respiratory syncytial virus [22]. Investigators had shown an 800-fold reduction in the respiratory syncytial virus when 10 μM concentration of zinc was present during preincubation, adsorption, penetration, and egress [22]. In the clinical scenario, zinc supplementation resulted in a marked reduction in pneumonia prevalence in children [23], [24].

Although the symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by different viruses.\nBoth the flu and COVID-19 spread in similar ways. Droplets or smaller virus particles from a sick person can transmit the virus to other people nearby. The smallest particles may linger in the air, and another person can inhale them and become infected.\nFlu: A vaccine is available and effective in preventing some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity or duration of the flu. The flu vaccine is reformulated every year in anticipation of the influenza strains that are expected to circulate. It is very important to get vaccinated for the flu as the COVID pandemic continues.\nLisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, explains how the flu and COVID-19 are similar and how they are different.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: PolitiFact | No, WHO has not said COVID-19 no worse than the flu\nContent:\nCorrectiv, which is based in Germany and is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, found in October 2020 that the WHO did not confirm that COVID-19 is less bad than the flu. The WHO told Correctiv that flu deaths vary every year, but that it estimated the infectious mortality rate for seasonal flu to be below 0.1%, which means the severity of the flu is \"much lower\" than of COVID-19.\nHe estimates that the true infection mortality rate is between 0.4% and 0.8%. While flu is a lethal disease, Russo said, he thinks Fuellmich underestimates the risk from COVID-19. \"I think we can all agree, we never with influenza see the carnage that we’re seeing with COVID,\" Russo said.

This left them feeling faint, light-headed, or \"smothered.\"\nThey were also concerned about how dangerous this might be, and how less oxygen and more carbon dioxide might affect their health. One driver who crashed his SUV into a pole in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, on April 23, 2020, actually blamed his collision on his mask.\nHe told police he passed out because he'd been wearing an N95 mask for too long. Initially, the investigating officers believed him, writing in a Facebook post that he was the only person in the car and passed out due to \"insufficient oxygen intake/excessive carbon dioxide intake.\" The post was shared more than 2,700 times and received hundreds of comments, with a few sharing their own experiences of feeling smothered by this type of mask.\nThis is why a cloth mask does not absolutely protect you from inhaling the virus, but by disturbing your exhalation flow it tends to protect those around you from aerosols in your breath.\" Carroll doubted that any cloth face covering would ever fit against the face so tight that someone would pass out from a lack of oxygen.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: From the Frontlines: The Truth About Masks and COVID-19 | American ...\nContent:\nThere is a tremendous amount of disinformation circulating regarding the use <strong>of</strong> <strong>masks</strong> <strong>to</strong> decrease transmission of COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-19\nTitle: Coronavirus: 'Deadly masks' claims debunked\nContent:\nOne of the most common themes in misleading posts surrounding the use of masks is that they limit the amount of oxygen getting into the body.

In our larger study of a more generalizable cohort, we tested the effects of cloth and surgical facemasks on heart rate, oxygen saturation and transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels both at rest and during physical activity. With approval from the University Hospitals of Cleveland IRB (study #20200804), we enrolled hospital employees in this study between August and October 2020.\nOverall, these findings may help people–especially those unaccustomed to wearing facemasks–be reassured that their body is able to adequately get oxygen in and carbon dioxide out while wearing a facemask, and therefore may help increase usage and limit viral spread. We observed two statistically significant changes in physiology during our study, both changes in heart rate and not gas exchange. First, we observed an expected and intended increase in heart rate with walking without a mask compared to sitting without a mask. This finding supports that the level of activity achieved by our subjects was considerable, though future studies may use treadmills or other devices to more precisely prescribe the level of exertion.\nIn conclusion, facemasks did not impair oxygenation or ventilation among 50 adults at rest or during physical activity. No episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia occurred with either cloth or surgical masks, both at rest and while walking briskly. The risk of pathologic gas exchange impairment with cloth masks and surgical masks is near-zero in the general adult population. The authors received no specific funding for this work.\nOne subject had SpO2 decrease by ≥3% (99% to 95.7% while walking with a cloth mask). Five subjects had CO2 tension increase by ≥5 mmHg, one of whom had this occur during three phases (walking with a cloth mask, both sitting and walking with a surgical mask).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-06-03, is an article from TEMPO that debunks the claim that a cyclist died due to lack of oxygen from wearing a mask.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.\nTwo studies (Rowhani-Rahbar et al, 2013; Klein et al, 2010) indicate that for every 10,000 children who get their first MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots when they are ages 12-23 months, about four will have a febrile seizure during the 7-10 days following vaccination. Children of the same age who get the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine as their first vaccine against these diseases are twice as likely to have a febrile seizure during the same time period.\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that decreases the body’s ability to stop bleeding. It can happen after both natural measles infection as well as after getting the MMR vaccine. However, it is usually not life threating. Treatment may include blood transfusion and medications.\nThe illness usually develops within 1 year after initial measles infection and has a high death rate. There have been three published reports of this complication happening to people who are vaccinated. In these cases, encephalitis developed between 4 and 9 months after MMR vaccination.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-11-26\nTitle: Fact check: MMR vaccine is not more dangerous than measles and ...\nContent:\nSocial media users have been sharing content online claiming the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is more dangerous than measles itself. This claim is false. Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS · An example can be seen here and here . One post’s description reads: “Most doctors are trained to deny vaccine failure, vaccine injury, and vaccine death. The MMR causes measles and other various side effects some of which are more serious than the measles that they try to scare the public with.”\nFalse. The MMR vaccine that prevents the measles virus is not more dangerous than the virus itself and does not cause the virus.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measles causes symptoms such as high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and rash. (here ) The CDC recommends the MMR vaccination to prevent measles, which the United States reported 1,282 cases of in 2019. (www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html and here )\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America explains on its website that the MMR vaccine does not cause measles. (here ) The vaccine is made from a weakened live virus which the immune system reacts to, causing some to have mild symptoms such as a fever or rash.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2018-06-15\nTitle: The Truth About the MMR Vaccine\nContent:\nThe MMR vaccine, introduced in the United States in 1971, helps prevent the measles, the mumps, and rubella (German measles). This vaccine was a huge development in the battle to prevent these dangerous diseases. However, the MMR vaccine is no stranger to controversy. In 1998, a\nCDC states that “getting [the] MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.” · Side effects from the MMR vaccine can range from minor to serious: ... If you or your child has side effects from the vaccine that concern you, tell your doctor. ... CDC, vaccines have reduced outbreaks of many dangerous and preventable infectious diseases.\nThe MMR vaccine protects against three major diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). All three of these diseases can cause serious health complications. In rare cases, they can even lead to death.\nCDC, vaccines have reduced outbreaks of many dangerous and preventable infectious diseases. If you’re concerned about the safety of vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, the best thing to do is to stay informed and always examine the risks and benefits of any medical procedure.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps and Rubella Vaccine) | Vaccine Knowledge ...\nContent:\nThe <strong>MMR</strong> <strong>vaccine</strong> gives protection against three serious diseases: <strong>measles</strong>, mumps, and rubella · According to the WHO, an estimated 128,000 people died globally from <strong>measles</strong> in 2021 – mostly children under the age of five years,\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Addressing misconceptions on measles vaccination\nContent:\nMMR vaccines provide protection against measles, mumps and rubella without causing the development of severe symptoms, complications or sequelae that are associated with the diseases. Mild symptoms such as rash or fever may occur after vaccination in 3 to 5 of 100 individuals, as MMR is a live-attenuated vaccine.\nOne reason why this misperception exists may be that natural immunity against measles, which is acquired through disease, gives life-long immunity while vaccination does not [4]. However, it has been shown that a second dose of the vaccine does lead to a protective level of antibodies [4]. Thus, two doses of MMR vaccine are recommended to reach immunity against measles.\nDuring this time, non-immune individuals may be infected and measles can spread. Another reason why the myth exists may be the desire to avoid potential side effects from vaccination. Vaccinations, as every other pharmaceutical substance, do entail a certain probability of side effects [6], such as fever in 5–15 of 100 first doses or seizures in 1 of 3 000 first doses [7]. More severe reactions occur only in single cases with incidences below 1 in 10 000. MMR vaccination thus has an excellent safety record and is therefore recommended by all EU countries.\nVaccines provide protection against measles without the development of severe symptoms, complications or sequelae. Severe adverse events following MMR vaccination are very rare. It is therefore safer to vaccinate than to contract the disease. Further, immunity through vaccination will protect others while immunity through the disease exposes others to the risk of the disease before and during the time of infection.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 contains details about the MMR vaccine's safety and side effects from the CDC. It mentions that the MMR vaccine can cause febrile seizures and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but these cases are rare. The vaccine cannot cause measles, mumps, or rubella, but it may cause mild symptoms like fever or rash.\n\nInformation 2 is a fact-check from Reuters, published on the same date as the claim, debunking the myth that the MMR vaccine is more dangerous than measles and causes measles. The fact-check refers to the CDC and the Infectious Diseases Society of America as sources.\n\nInformation 3 is an article from Verywell Health, published in 2018, discussing the MMR vaccine's history, safety, and benefits. It highlights that the MMR vaccine is safe and reduces outbreaks of dangerous diseases.\n\nInformation 4 is a page from Vaccine Knowledge Project, providing information about the MMR vaccine. It mentions that the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella and that measles caused an estimated 128,000 deaths globally in 2021.\n\nInformation 5 is a document addressing misconceptions about measles vaccination. It explains that MMR vaccines protect against measles, mumps, and rubella without causing severe symptoms or complications. It also states that severe adverse events following MMR vaccination are very rare.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim is true, as the MMR vaccine does not cause measles and is not more dangerous than measles. The provided information supports this conclusion, with multiple sources confirming that the MMR vaccine does not cause measles and has a much better safety profile than measles.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim and Information 2 directly address the topic and debunk the myth that the MMR vaccine is more dangerous than measles and causes measles. Information 1 provides details about the MMR vaccine's side effects, further emphasizing that the vaccine does not cause measles. Information 3, 4, and 5 also support the claim by discussing the MMR vaccine's safety and benefits.\n\nGiven that the claim and Information 2 share the same publication date, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is based on the fact-check provided in Information 2.

In the pantheon of emerging infectious diseases, Ebola virus stands out as one of the deadliest. The Zaire species of Ebola kills somewhere between 40 to 90% of its victims, and usually upwards of 60% of infected people die [30]. Only a handful of infectious diseases can claim such high death rates, including rabies [31, 32], pneumonic plague, and inhalational anthrax [33]. About 14,000 deaths due to Ebola were recorded in 2014. Why did the Ebola outbreak result in a much lower death toll compared to COVID-19?\nThe second major outbreak was due to exportation of MERS from Saudi Arabia via a business traveler to South Korea resulting in an explosive but in the end contained outbreak in 2015 [28]. Lessons learned from the MERS outbreak were the foundation of Korea’s enhanced pandemic preparedness plans which enabled the country to successfully curb the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea in early 2020. Ebola was declared a public health emergency in 2014 in West Africa, and again in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo [6, 29]. In the pantheon of emerging infectious diseases, Ebola virus stands out as one of the deadliest.\nCOVID-19 is not associated with the highest case fatality rate compared with other emerging viral diseases such as SARS and Ebola, but the combination of a high reproduction number, superspreading events and a globally immunologically naïve population has led to the highest global number of deaths in the past 20 decade compared to any other pandemic.\nWhy did the Ebola outbreak result in a much lower death toll compared to COVID-19? One major difference between Ebola and COVID-19 is the mode and timing of transmission. Ebola is spread during the last stage of the disease through bodily fluids. Exposure of infected individuals to a high-density population could result in a catastrophic outbreak, however, overall the R0 is far lower than that of COVID-19 as transmission depends on closer proximity between humans, in particular contact to bodily fluids.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-08-06\nTitle: Fact Check-Misleading comparison between COVID-19 and diseases ...\nContent:\nHIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea are primarily transmitted via sex (here) , here), while Ebola is transmitted via direct contact with bodily fluid of someone infected or who recently died (here).

Kenya does not guarantee social security for all and does not protect the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food and shelter at all times, even during an emergency.\nThe research focused on Nairobi in part because it has the fastest growing number of informal settlements in the country and was one of the counties targeted by the government’s pandemic-related cash transfer program. Of the 10 million people living in informal settlements across Kenya, 2.4 million live in Nairobi – making up half the city’s population yet crammed into only 1 percent of its land. Residents of informal settlements, who are the most likely to live in extreme poverty and thus struggle to meet their basic needs, were also the most socio-economically affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nDirect the relevant state departments to, in the short term, re-start the emergency cash transfer program given the control measures are still in place and allocate more funding to greatly expand it for as long as the government of Kenya has Covid-19 pandemic-related measures in place to ensure that all vulnerable households, including those in Nairobi’s informal settlements, have the means to afford food, rent, and other expenses fundamental to human rights.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-14\nTitle: Cash transfers lead the social assistance response to COVID-19 | Devex\nContent:\n“The debate should no longer be about what cash transfers are critical interventions in such an emergency situation like this, it should really be how we need to use cash transfers to deploy quickly, faster, and reach as many as we can.”— Milkah Chebii, social protection payments specialist, Financial Sector Deepening Kenya · Other options include electronic vouchers — such as something like a debit card — which people can redeem for products from a vendor. For example, Indonesia has expanded its e-food voucher program from 15 million to 20 million low-income households in response to the pandemic. Otherwise, physical cash is also an option, which can be distributed by local mobile agents of banks. But because the COVID-19 can persist on surfaces, some governments, such as in Kenya, are encouraging people to use mobile payments rather than cash.\nAmong social assistance responses from governments, cash transfers have been the most widely used during this crisis. There are 143 cash programs in 81 countries that have been expanded or adapted to the crisis. Of those programs, 65 in 43 countries are new initiatives introduced as part of the response to COVID-19.\nWomen leave a bank after withdrawing cash during a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Agra, India.

For some countries, distributing cash transfers will be easier than others. Some countries have existing social safety net structures they can expand upon and others already have well-established ways to deliver cash easily, such as widespread use of mobile money. On March 24, India put its population of 1.3 billion people under lockdown. On April 3rd, the government launched a cash transfer program, which included putting 500 rupees, or $6.50, in the accounts of 204 million women who are already enrolled in one of its existing financial inclusion programs.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-08-24\nTitle: Kenya enhances its cash transfer programmes in response to the ...\nContent:\nKenya’s private sector, financial institutions, non-state actors and philanthropists have additionally pooled resources to complement Government efforts to fight the virus. The donor community has also been at hand to augment the country’s initiatives largely centred around cash transfers and health support. However, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold, a well-coordinated, coherent approach is imperative.\nUrban women who are employed as domestic workers are worst hit with COVID-19 crisis as employers minimise contacts with these persons now considered ‘external,’ hence a cash transfer modelling this segment presents an opportunity.

Cash transfers, Coronavirus, Covid-19, Financial service providers, HSNP, Inua Jamii, Poverty, Social protection\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Protection has been instrumental in the successful implementation of the programme dubbed ‘Inua Jamii’ and has transformed its payment delivery mechanism from a manual system to a fully digital solution that offers choice, convenience and greater dignity to the recipients. This aligns with the wider government’s quest to digitise all Government to Persons (G2P) payments. A total of KShs. 13 billion (US$ 130 million) has so far been disbursed to cover January to June 2020 payments, cushioning recipients from COVID-19-shocks.\nThere is a need for greater fiscal space in the short term to boost health expenditure, contain the spread of the pandemic, and cushion the hardest-hit economic sectors, all with an eye on stimulating domestic consumption. Consequently, to enhance the coordination of different initiatives from multiple stakeholders and ensure effective management and accountability of the various resources, the Government has set up a COVID-19 emergency response fund board.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-07-20\nTitle: 'Who received that money?'

In response to the first confirmed case in Kenya on March 13, 2020, the government instituted a series of measures designed to limit personal interactions, including a curfew and travel ban.\nAdditionally, 18 percent of the women had closed their businesses between January and May 2020, at least temporarily, while 47 percent expected the Covid-19 crisis to shut down their business at some point at least temporarily. While the Government of Kenya implemented a number of policies designed to partially stabilize incomes and reduce health risk, only 17 percent of business owners in this study had received any government relief by May 2020, as the relief primarily catered to the formal economy (i.e. through tax cuts and formal loan protections).\nIn response to the pandemic, many governments around the world implemented short-term unconditional cash transfers as a critical assistance tool. As of September 2020, 156 countries had initiated some form of cash transfers to combat the Covid-19 crisis.2 However, limited rigorous evidence exists on the effectiveness of these programs, particularly on the effects of one-off emergency cash transfers on small businesses and entrepreneurs.3\nCan one-time cash transfers help women-led microenterprises withstand Covid-19 shocks and improve business outcomes? Dandora is a dense informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, with 150,000 residents. It is the site of a thirty-acre trash dump that services all of Nairobi, despite having been declared full in 2001, and its pollution plays a major role in poor health and respiratory issues among its residents. This, along with the density of Dandora and surrounding areas, led to substantial anxiety that Covid-19 would spread quickly among its residents.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, describes the difficulties faced by many Kenyans, particularly those in informal settlements, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government's cash transfer program had limitations, such as not considering job loss as a factor for eligibility. The UNDP reported that residents of informal settlements, who are most likely to live in extreme poverty, were the most socio-economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, discusses the increasing use of cash transfers as a social assistance response to the Covid-19 crisis. There are 143 cash programs in 81 countries, with 65 being new initiatives. Kenya is encouraging mobile payments to minimize the risk of surface transmission.\n\nInformation 3, published after the claim, highlights Kenya's efforts to enhance its cash transfer programs in response to the pandemic. The Government Social Payments Specialist at FSD Kenya, Dr. Milkah Chebii, suggested that a cash transfer model for urban women employed as domestic workers could be beneficial. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection has been instrumental in implementing the 'Inua Jamii' program, which has disbursed KShs. 13 billion (US$ 130 million) to cover January to June 2020 payments.\n\nInformation 4, published after the claim, reports on a Human Rights Watch investigation alleging that Kenya's cash transfer program failed to protect most vulnerable people suffering economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Political leaders funneled some funds to friends, relatives, and supporters, and the implementation of the program was shrouded in secrecy.

However, the information does establish that the Kenyan government has implemented cash transfer programs as part of their response to the pandemic.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is also FDA-approved to treat autoimmune conditions such as chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus in adults, and rheumatoid arthritis. The EUA was based upon limited evidence that the medicines may provide benefit, and for this reason, we authorized their use only in hospitalized patients under careful heart monitoring.\nJuly 1, 2020 Update: A summary of the FDA review of safety issues with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is now available. This includes reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.\nJune 15, 2020 Update: Based on ongoing analysis and emerging scientific data, FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients when a clinical trial is unavailable or participation is not feasible.\nThe FDA is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin and other QT prolonging medicines. We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions. Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-09, is about a clinical trial called ORCHID, which was conducted by the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Clinical Trials Network of NHLBI. The trial began in April 2020 at 34 hospitals across the United States and enrolled 479 of the expected 510 patients. The trial was initiated based on lab studies and preliminary reports suggesting that hydroxychloroquine might have promise in treating SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, preliminary evidence in June indicated that the drug was unlikely to offer any benefit. The final data and analyses of the trial showed that hydroxychloroquine does not improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a review of existing evidence on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating and preventing COVID-19. The review concludes that hydroxychloroquine is not beneficial for patients with COVID-19 who require care in hospital. The evidence is less clear for prevention of COVID-19 and for people being treated as outpatients.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) based on findings from 30 trials with more than 10 000 COVID-19 patients. The recommendation states that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce mortality, the need for or duration of mechanical ventilation. The WHO also does not recommend hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-11-17, is a study that found similar rates of COVID-19 in patients who received hydroxychloroquine and those who did not. Adverse events were more common in those who received hydroxychloroquine, and symptom alleviation and time to relief of symptoms did not differ meaningfully between the two groups. The study concludes that their findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, is a caution from the FDA against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19, except in hospitalized patients under careful heart monitoring. The FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for these drugs in June 2020 based on ongoing analysis and emerging scientific data.\n\nClaim: Publication date: 2020-05-15, Content: Further evidence does not support hydroxychloroquine for patients with COVID-19\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. The ORCHID trial, which began in April 2020, showed that hydroxychloroquine does not improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A review of existing evidence and a recommendation from the WHO also support this claim. Additionally, a study published in November 2023 found that adverse events were more common in patients who received hydroxychloroquine, and their findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. The FDA also cautions against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19, except in hospitalized patients under careful heart monitoring.", "response": "TRUE."}

The origin of this quote goes back to 2012, the year in which is published the global financial stability report from the IMF. Chapter 4 mentions the potential risk of increasing life expectancy for the global economy. We can read there that: “Like any other risk faced by economic agents – such as interest rate or exchange rate risk – longevity risk must be recognized and addressed.” Solutions are also mentioned: “To cushion the financial effects of longevity risk, action must be taken on several fronts, including raising the retirement age […] Governments must recognize their exposure to longevity risk.\nThe image illustrating the article is a photo of Christine Lagarde with the title “IMF calls for lower pensions due to” risk of people living longer than expected “”, but neither this sentence nor Lagarde is directly quoted in the article.

The sensation impressed upon the reader is that the head of the IMF would be suggesting or even indicating a kind of pogrom against the elderly. Let us examine these one at a time. The most recent text in which Christine Lagarde addresses the risks associated to the aging population dates back to the beginning of March 2016.\nFirst of all, we are invited to consider the fact that this longevity is the result of an increase in the quality of life.

He said this must be done “so you don’t have side effects”. “If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more -- 700,000 people -- who will suffer from that. So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know: pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities. It's very, very hard, and that actual decision of 'OK, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world', governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on,” Gates said.\nNotably, the interview with Gates was published on April 9, 2020 -- months before any medical research companies had released preliminary efficacy results of the various vaccine trials that have now led to a batch of promising candidates.

She spoke with Dr. Roby Bhattacharyya, an infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, who cited data suggesting that omicron may be just as severe as previous variants in unvaccinated people, while spreading faster — which could lead to a sharp increase in hospitalizations. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told ABC News' This Week on Sunday that the country is seeing \"almost a vertical increase\" in cases and that even a relatively lower rate of hospitalizations could strain already overwhelmed hospitals.\nThe CDC now estimates that 95.4% of coronavirus cases are caused by the omicron variant, based on data for the week ending Saturday. \"Just seeing the transmissibility of delta was remarkable already, but this is just even beyond that,\" Dean added. \"So I think that's something that's hard to wrap our heads around. Just how many people are likely to be infected over the next month is just going to be a lot of disruption, unfortunately.\"\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-01-09\nTitle: U.S. Sets Covid Global Daily Record of Over 1 Million Virus Cases ...\nContent:\nThe U.S. added more than 1 million people to its Covid-19 case count on Monday as the true scope of a surge in infections over the holidays began to round into view.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2022-01-09\nTitle: U.S. reports nearly 1 mln COVID-19 cases in a day, setting global ...\nContent:\nJan 4 (Reuters) - The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world and nearly double the previous U.S. peak set a week ago as the spread of the Omicron variant showed no signs of slowing.\nHe said projections show COVID hospitalizations could surpass 5,000, far higher than Maryland's previous peak of 1,952 last year.

Others stay and are married off at a young age. Bangladesh, despite having earned global praise for hosting the large Rohingya population, is getting impatient with the attendant burdens. By refusing to acknowledge that the crisis will likely drag on indefinitely and planning accordingly, Dhaka risks making a difficult situation worse.\nThe Rohingya refugees in southern Bangladesh are facing increasingly grim prospects of returning to their homes in Myanmar, as conditions in the camps become ever more difficult. Over the last two years, international funding for basic, life-saving services has dropped dramatically as crises elsewhere grab attention and donor fatigue sets in.\nIn this excerpt from the Watch List 2023 – Autumn Update, Crisis Group urges Europe to keep providing humanitarian assistance and increase its intake of refugees. ... The future looks increasingly bleak for close to one million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, most of whom were forced out of western Myanmar more than six years ago.\nBefore a new conference can take place, however, Dhaka will need to change its approach to the refugee crisis, accepting that the vast majority of the refugees will remain in Bangladesh for years to come. Thirdly, the EU and member states should send a clear signal about repatriation. Given the crisis in Myanmar, the chances that Rohingya refugees can go home have only grown slimmer.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: A forced migration from Myanmar to Bangladesh and beyond: ...\nContent:\nSince after independence, the Rohingya Muslims suffer numerous human rights abuses such as mass killings, rape, and torture, and this has continued till today. These have created a chronic refugee crisis in neighbouring Bangladesh. As of late, thousands of Rohingyas remain displaced depending on humanitarian aid for survival, while some also undergo brutal repression by the Myanmar border guard (Abdelkader 2013).\nMoreover, Rohingya’s crisis is not only religiously founded, it comprises both economic- and political-related issues. The Rohingyas were viewed as economically developed by the Buddhists of Myanmar who thought that their culture is under siege than that of the Rohingya. This coupled with the deeply entrenched Islamaphobia in Rakhine and Myanmar being surrounded by Islamic countries, like Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh.\nThe fear of being persecuted has been raised by the refugees, and the foreign minister of Bangladesh has raised this issue in her visit to Myanmar. Although Bangladesh’s authorities want to see the Rohingyas repatriated as they are wary that their national resources will be drained, yet pushing them back will be inhumane in the face of the Rohingya crisis.\nIn 1993, during a meeting held to discuss the possible solutions for the 250,000 Rohingya refugees who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a senior UNHCR staff member was quoted saying “these are primitive people (referring to the Rohingyas). At the end, they will go where they are told to go”. This statement reflects the exemplary of the organisation engagement with the Rohingyas for years and the lack of willingness to uphold the UNHCR protection principles. Moreover, Jeff Crisp also highlighted that from the unpublished material by UNHCR, in 1970s and 1980s, many refugees were sent back to Myanmar in a way that was untimely, involuntary and unsafe (Crisp 2018).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Future Bleak for Rohingya in Bangladesh, Myanmar | Human Rights Watch\nContent:\nOne million Rohingya refugees in <strong>Bangladesh</strong> face little prospect of safely returning home, six years since <strong>the</strong> <strong>Myanmar</strong> military launched a campaign of mass atrocities in Rakhine State on August 25, 2017.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2, both published in 2019, discuss the interest of 100 South Korean businesses in relocating from Myanmar to Bangladesh.

Facebook vice president for public policy Brian Rice wrote the same month that Slavitt’s pressure seemed “very much like a crossroads for us with the [Biden] White House in these early days.”\nThen-White House press secretary Jen Psaki openly said in July 2021 that the White House was “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation,” including about COVID-19 vaccines, for removal. The government policing of alleged misinformation ultimately prompted pushback from civil libertarians when it emerged last spring that the Department of Homeland Security intended to create a “Disinformation Governance Board.” · The idea was ultimately shelved. In October, the Intercept reported that Facebook had introduced a special portal through which federal officials made moderation requests, including to squelch “parody accounts or accounts with virtually no followers or influence.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-02-08\nTitle: Facebook says it plans to remove posts with false vaccine claims.\nContent:\nMonday’s move goes further by targeting unpaid posts to the site and particularly Facebook pages and groups. Instead of targeting only misinformation around Covid-19 vaccines, the update encompasses false claims around all vaccines. Facebook said it had consulted with the World Health Organization and other leading health institutes to determine a list of false or misleading claims around Covid-19 and vaccines in general.\nFacebook also said it would give $120 million in advertising credits to health ministries, nongovernmental organizations and United Nations agencies to aid in spreading reliable Covid-19 vaccine and preventive health information. As vaccination centers roll out more widely, Facebook said it would help point people to locations where they can receive the vaccine. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, has been proactive against false information related to the coronavirus. He has frequently hosted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, on Facebook to give live video updates on the American response to the coronavirus.\nIn October, the social network prohibited people and companies from purchasing advertising that included false or misleading information about vaccines. In December, Facebook said it would remove posts with claims that had been debunked by the World Health Organization or government agencies.

There are twelve hundred different mutations between the genomes of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2—scattered variations that demonstrate the messiness of evolution.\nAfter the pandemic began, he was among the scientists whom Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, consulted regarding the origins of the virus. On January 31, 2020, according to an e-mail obtained by BuzzFeed News, Andersen wrote to Fauci and others that the SARS-CoV-2 genome seemed “inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”\nAndersen noted that “a really small part” of SARS-CoV-2’s genome had “unusual features.” Its spike—the crucial bit of surface protein that a coronavirus uses to invade a cell—appeared able to bind tightly to a human-cell receptor known as ACE2. This, Andersen told me, “means that it’s more effective at infecting human cells.” The other significant trait, a rare insertion in the genome of twelve nucleotides, called a furin cleavage site, might also increase the virus’s transmissibility, and lower the species barrier, allowing the virus to jump more easily to humans.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-28\nTitle: What does the science say about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic?\nContent:\nTwo U.S. intelligence agencies reportedly support the lab leak theory — with low-to-moderate confidence.

The virus as a bioweapon and the possible laboratory leak from legitimate research are the two most common remaining theories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2.\nOn the surface, similarities exist between bioweapons and viral pandemics that may have allowed this conspiracy theory to seem plausible. As nonconventional, nonkinetic weapons of mass destruction, bioweapons can create the same havoc as pandemics. As with a pandemic, if a bioweapon attack spreads widely, healthcare systems could be overwhelmed, perpetuating societal panic as well as frustration, despair, and psychological casualties among healthcare workers, adding to the panic.\nDespite similarities between bioweapons and natural outbreaks of viral diseases, the bioweapon conspiracy theories are easily invalidated. Biowarfare as imagined by the public is different from biowarfare that has been deployed in real life. Casualty from a successfully deployed bioweapon has never been remotely close to the devastation caused by this pandemic, and most likely, never will.\nThe virus as a bioweapon and the possible laboratory leak from legitimate research are the two most common remaining theories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this perspective is to show that the current pandemic is unlikely to have resulted from either bioweapons or a laboratory leak.

A prediction theory came up, when netizens started sharing a segment from Netflix Korean drama My Secret Terrius, where the characters discussed the outbreak of a new human-made coronavirus bioweapon.\nEach of these instances have given strong credence to the bioweapon theory, making it likely for such rumours to appear again. Furthermore, certain psychological traits play a big role in drawing people to such conspiracies. Karen M. Douglas, a social psychologist who studies belief in conspiracies at the University of Kent in Britain, told the New York Times that such conspiracies \"satisfy certain psychological motives\".\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-30, is a fact-checking article by BOOM FactCheck debunking the claim that a Marathi newspaper reported a conspiracy theory of coronavirus being a bioweapon. The newspaper had actually picked up the conspiracy theory from a Reddit thread that hosts contests for fictional stories inspired by real events.\n\nInformation 4, although the publication date is not specified, discusses the conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19, including the virus as a bioweapon and the possible laboratory leak. It explains the similarities between bioweapons and viral pandemics, but also points out that the current pandemic is unlikely to have resulted from either bioweapons or a laboratory leak.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-04-10, is another fact-checking article by BOOM FactCheck about the claim that coronavirus is a bioweapon. It mentions that the claim has been debunked, but certain psychological traits make people drawn to such conspiracies.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim that a Marathi newspaper reported a conspiracy theory of coronavirus being a bioweapon is false, as confirmed by Information 1. The newspaper had picked up the conspiracy theory from a Reddit thread, which is a work of fiction.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the conspiracy theory of coronavirus being a bioweapon is still circulating on the internet, as mentioned in Information 4 and 5. Although the claim has been debunked, people are still drawn to such conspiracies due to certain psychological motives.\n\nTherefore, while the specific claim about the Marathi newspaper is false, the broader issue of the coronavirus bioweapon conspiracy theory is still relevant and should be addressed.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim is false based on Information 1, which is a fact-checking article by BOOM FactCheck. The article debunks the claim and provides evidence that the Marathi newspaper had picked up the conspiracy theory from a Reddit thread that hosts contests for fictional stories inspired by real events.\n\nFurthermore, Information 4 and 5 provide additional context about the coronavirus bioweapon conspiracy theory. While the claim about the Marathi newspaper is false, the conspiracy theory itself is still circulating on the internet and should be addressed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

The agencies coordinate their enforcement and regulatory efforts pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding – often called the “FDA-FTC Liaison Agreement” – that governs the basic division of responsibilities between them.[9] The FDA has primary responsibility for claims that appear in labeling, including the package, product inserts, and other promotional materials available at point of sale.\nFor example, provisions in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) regarding “structure/function” claims[11] in labeling don’t govern the FTC’s assessment of those claims in advertising.[12] The FTC follows the same basic steps when evaluating any health-related claim regardless of whether, under FDA law, the claim would be considered a health claim, a structure/function claim, or a drug claim.\nLike the 1998 guide, this document provides guidance from FTC staff on how to ensure that claims about the benefits and safety of health-related products are truthful, not misleading, and supported by science. Since 1998, the FTC has settled or adjudicated more than 200 cases involving false or misleading advertising claims about the benefits or safety of dietary supplements or other health-related products, including foods, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, homeopathic products, health equipment, diagnostic tests, and health-related apps.\nFTC, 738 F.2d 554, 559 (2d Cir. 1984) (“FDA requirements and regulations . . .simply do not govern this case”).

Various scientific studies (we’ll get to those in a moment) have shown zinc lozenges to be effective in shortening the misery phase of common colds.

The findings of systematic reviews of related populations are promising; however, the reviews are limited by population, intervention, or are out of date [56], [57], [58].\nA 2016 Cochrane review of six RCTs concluded zinc supplementation was effective for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months [57]. Unlike an earlier review in 2000 of seven RCTs with adult participants and one RCT with children [59], an updated 2011 systematic review of 13 RCTs found a dose-dependent effect of zinc lozenges compared to placebo controls for reduced duration of common colds in adults [60]. Daily dosages less than 75 mg of zinc had no significant effect on duration of colds, however, daily dosage over 75 mg reduced the duration of colds by 42 % (95 % CI: 35 %–48 %). In a subsequent 2017 systematic review of seven RCTs of zinc lozenges with a daily dose >75 mg, a smaller reduction of 33 % (95 % CI 21 %–45 %) in the duration of common colds was found [61].

Articles about coronavirus being listed in search results after a specific Google query about “new cases” and a three-digit number are likely due to search engine algorithms and the extent of the pandemic. This is not, therefore, evidence that COVID-19 nor case numbers are fake.\nBut it is false to suggest these Google search results are evidence of a faked virus or faked numbers – and can be better explained as proof of an amalgam of search engine algorithms and the extensive reach of COVID-19. The novel coronavirus has resulted in a pandemic, which, according to the World Health Organisation, is defined as a “worldwide spread of a new disease” ( here ). Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the virus since it was first discovered, has listed more than 22 million cases of COVID-19 in 188 countries and regions across the globe ( coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ). Nearly 1 million people have died, while billions more have been forced to change their lifestyles as lockdowns and strict measures have been implemented to halt transmission of the illness.\nSeveral posts are circulating on Facebook that falsely claim Google search results can provide proof that the pandemic is not real. The basis of the claim involves Facebook users encouraging others to search Google with a combination of any three-digit number and the phrase: “new cases”. This produces a search result that is often topped with a news article about COVID-19 and includes a case number matching the three-digit figure in the search bar.\nThe basis of the claim involves Facebook users encouraging others to search Google with a combination of any three-digit number and the phrase: “new cases”.

The Link Between Distinct Conspiracy Beliefs ...\nContent:\nAnalytic-thinking predicts hoax beliefs and helping behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [Preprint]. 10.31234/osf.io/m3vth [CrossRef] Swami V., Coles R., Stieger S., Pietschnig J., Furnham A., Rehim S., Voracek M. (2011). Conspiracist ideation in Britain and Austria: Evidence of a monological belief system and associations between individual psychological differences and real-world and fictitious conspiracy theories.\nSpecifically, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs claiming that the pandemic is a hoax are linked to a weaker support of containment-related behavior compared to perceiving the pandemic as human-made which should be linked to a stronger support of self-centered prepping behavior.The COVID-19 Pandemic and Conspiracy Beliefs\nA higher perceived risk is, for example, associated with a greater likelihood to engage in protective behavior (Brewer et al., 2004). Therefore, if people believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax or exaggerated by the government, they should be less likely to follow official recommendations such as handwashing and social distancing (see also Stanley et al., 2020).\nWith the current research question in mind, we also added (in that order) questions about perceived threat by COVID-19, pandemic-related behaviors, endorsement of conspiracy beliefs, and a measure of general conspiracy mentality. We expected conspiracy beliefs that COVID-19 is a hoax or its relevance exaggerated to be associated with hesitancy to follow official recommendations but conspiracy beliefs stating that SARS-CoV-2 was human-made to be associated with increased tendencies to engage in prepping behavior.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Evidence from internet search data shows information-seeking ...\nContent:\nFinally, although one might expect official news to reduce concerns related to false messages, we do not find much indication that state announcements of first COVID-19 cases affect searches questioning whether the epidemic may be a hoax. Overall, our analysis of internet search data suggests that government information disclosure does help focus public attention on the crisis. Our evidence also indicates that people seem to mainly react by seeking information on what they can and should do in response to the epidemic.\nAverage search frequency per state per day for the terms: coronavirus symptoms (8,522.6), coronavirus treatment (448.2), hand sanitizer (3,214.7), testing near me (381.6), quarantine (2,158.2), isolation (631.2), coronavirus conspiracy (205.1), and coronavirus hoax (123.0). Evidence from internet search data shows information-seeking responses to news of local COVID-19 cases\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries, including the United States, with confirmed cases in all states. The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state.\nThere was no observable trend in the search behavior in the days leading up to the announcements, suggesting the first “local” case indeed heightened the collective attention to the pandemic. However, the increased level of information seeking faded within 2 wk, even though many announcements of school closures or other mitigation strategies followed, suggesting that increased attention is only short-lived. This is consistent with no observable trend in the sense of urgency prior to the local announcement. ... Time-varying effects of announcements of the first COVID-19 case in a state on searches for coronavirus.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-05-13\nTitle: Fact Check-Different methods used to report COVID-19 deaths are ...\nContent:\nAlternative ways of recording COVID-19 deaths are not evidence the pandemic is a hoax, despite social media users claiming otherwise. The false claim was suggested by a popular Facebook video that isolated a comment from Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser (here). Reuters has repeatedly debunked misinformation downplaying the pandemic, for instance here and here .\nMost importantly, all these different measures concur that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on deaths. Government data shows huge spikes during the first and second waves (here) and ONS figures illustrate that mortality was significantly higher than the five-year average during these periods (here). Globally, over 3.3 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organisation so far (covid19.who.int/). False. Different methods of measuring COVID-19 deaths are not evidence that the pandemic is a hoax.\nThe UK government, the ONS and other agencies publish different data on coronavirus deaths that have strengths and weaknesses in helping us understand the pandemic. The government, for instance, records deaths within 28 days of a positive test (coronavirus.data.gov.uk/). By contrast, one method used by the ONS is to record deaths where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. A representative for the organisation told Reuters that a doctor or coroner will analyse evidence like laboratory tests, post-mortem results, and symptoms, before deciding the causes of death “to the best of their knowledge and professional judgement”.\nHowever, the latest ONS monthly analysis showed that just 3.3% of COVID-19 deaths in England and Wales between March 2020 and March 2021 were recorded as suspected” coronavirus deaths (here). Further information on how the ONS calculate their statistics is available (here). Most importantly, all these different measures concur that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on deaths.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2022-01-05\nTitle: Fact check: The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hoax\nContent:\nNearly two years since the first COVID-19 case was detected, some people are still pushing the conspiracy theory that the pandemic is a hoax, despite 800,000 deaths and 55 million confirmed infections in the U.S. alone. The false narrative that COVID-19 doesn’t exist took off in May 2020, after the “Plandemic” documentary produced by a widely discredited scientist promoted misinformation surrounding the virus and its origins.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic is not a \"lie\" or a hoax, as the post claims. Data shows COVID-19 has infected and killed millions of people across the world, and scientists have identified and isolated the novel coronavirus. Special access for subscribers! Click here to sign up for our fact-check text chat · The Twitter and Facebook users who shared the post did not return requests for comment. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020, and data shows there have been more than 5 million confirmed deaths from the virus and 290 million positive cases worldwide.\nSeveral independent fact-check organizations have previously debunked the claim that nobody has been discovered dead in their home from COVID-19, as well as claims that the pandemic is a hoax. Since the first case of COVID-19 emerged, the WHO has identified different variants of concern including beta, gamma, delta and most recently, omicron. Health officials say the pandemic will fade when enough people become immune to COVID-19 either through vaccination or prior infection.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-21, is a fact-check article that debunks the claim that Google search results can be used as evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. The article explains that the search results are likely due to search engine algorithms and the extensive reach of the pandemic. It also mentions that there have been more than 22 million cases of COVID-19 and nearly 1 million deaths worldwide.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not specified, is a preprint article that investigates the link between conspiracy beliefs and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that conspiracy beliefs that the pandemic is a hoax are linked to a weaker support of containment-related behavior.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, is an analysis of internet search data that shows information-seeking responses to news of local COVID-19 cases. The analysis found that there was an increase in searches for terms related to the pandemic after the first local case was announced, but the increased level of information seeking faded within two weeks.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-05-13, is a fact-check article that debunks the claim that different methods of measuring COVID-19 deaths are evidence that the pandemic is a hoax. The article explains that different methods of measuring deaths, such as recording deaths within 28 days of a positive test or recording deaths where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, all show that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on deaths.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-01-05, is a fact-check article that debunks the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. The article states that data shows that the pandemic has infected and killed millions of people worldwide, and scientists have identified and isolated the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn summary, all the information provided supports the claim that search results are not evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. The pandemic is a real and serious global health crisis, with millions of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. The claim that Google search results can be used as evidence that the pandemic is a hoax is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-check articles. Additionally, different methods of measuring COVID-19 deaths all show that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on deaths, and conspiracy beliefs that the pandemic is a hoax are linked to a weaker support of containment-related behavior.", "response": "FALSE."}

Minister Roberto Speranza appointed Walter Ricciardi, a member of World Health Organization's executive committee and former president of Italian National Institute of Health, as a special adviser for relations between Italy and international health organisations.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Italy Coronavirus Map and Case Count - The New York Times\nContent:\nSee the latest charts and maps of coronavirus <strong>cases</strong>, deaths and vaccinations <strong>in</strong> <strong>Italy</strong>.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Italy COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer\nContent:\n<strong>Italy</strong> Coronavirus update with statistics and graphs: total and new <strong>cases</strong>, deaths per <strong>day</strong>, mortality and recovery rates, current active <strong>cases</strong>, recoveries, trends and timeline.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-11-09\nTitle: How covid-19 surprised Italy again - The Washington Post\nContent:\nCrisanti said no country can keep pace with contact tracing when it is seeing 35,000 cases per day, as Italy is now. But Italy could have given itself a better chance to contain the wave if it had built more labs across the country, performing granular surveillance of hot-spot neighborhoods and workplaces, at the first beginning of the uptick. Crisanti said Italy should have been testing 400,000 people per day at the end of the summer when it was instead testing 75,000. The summer heightened the dangers for what Italians call the “rientro” — the post-holiday return to city life.\nHospitals now have more protective gear, more ventilators and more intensive-care capacity than in the spring. But Italy’s breakdown came in an earlier line of defense: Contact tracers increasingly struggled to identify and isolate infected people before the virus spread through communities. ... The contact-tracing system “crumbled as soon as we exceeded 1,000 cases per day,” said Andrea Crisanti, a virologist at the University of Padua who advised the Veneto region in the spring.\nSeveral European scientists, including in Italy, made the case that the virus had weakened, a minority scientific position that nonetheless captured attention with summer hospitalization rates so low. Italy had given itself one of the best chances among European countries to sustainably contain the virus after the spring crisis. Its emergence from the March and April lockdown had been anything but swift or reckless, with new reopenings coming at two-week intervals to gauge their riskiness.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had said in August that the country would be able to deal with any future increases in cases without limits on “economic activity.” · All along, some degree of resurgence was inevitable — especially as the weather cooled and people began to socialize more indoors. But Italian health officials had reasoned that a second wave wouldn’t be nearly as severe as the first. Hospitals were more prepared.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-01, states that the first COVID-19 case in Italy was confirmed on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-12-30, confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 9 March 2020.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, published on 2020-04-22 and without a specific date, provide real-time updates on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-11-09, states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. The article also mentions that hospitals were more prepared for a second wave of the virus, but the contact-tracing system had already crumbled.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true. The pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, which occurred in February and March 2020, as the country struggled to cope with the sudden surge of cases. However, the claim does not mention any specific date or context for the pictures.\n\nThe information published on 2021-02-01 and 2023-12-30 confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020. Therefore, it is possible that the pictures in question were taken during the first wave of the virus in Italy.\n\nHowever, the information published on 2020-11-09 states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. This suggests that the situation in Italy had worsened again by November 2020, and the country was facing a second wave of the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true, it does not provide enough context or evidence to support the claim. The available information suggests that the pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, but it is also possible that they are from a later stage of the pandemic when the country was facing a second wave of the virus. Therefore, the claim cannot be classified as entirely true or false without further information.", "response": "FALSE."}

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.

On the most basic level, insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness and feelings of fatigue. Sleep disturbances cause reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impair our ability to maintain focus.

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has shined a concerning light on the the physical and mental health of health care workers – and their lack of sleep.\nI am an expert in sleep and stress among middle-aged adults in the workplace, and my research has found that work-related stress influences sleep quantity and quality. And not only that – poor sleep may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for both health care workers and their patients.\nHealth care workers face many stressors, and many studies have shown that sleep plays a major role. For example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\nFor example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media.\nA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Sleep disorders, particularly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), affect a significant number of healthcare workers (HCWs). These sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, daytime drowsiness, and sleep deprivation, which can impair work productivity, lead to occupational accidents and errors, and negatively impact patient care. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA, and 40.9% of HCWs reported at least one type of sleep disorder.\n2. A study published in 2021 found that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression, 50% more likely to report psychological distress, and 70% more likely to report anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened sleep patterns and mental health issues among HCWs due to increased stress and workload.\n3. Insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impairments in maintaining focus. These effects can have severe consequences in patient care.\n4. Health care workers face significant work-related stress, which can negatively impact sleep quantity and quality. A 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\n5. A study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that nearly all frontline HCWs reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim \"Sleep Troubles Hit Health Care Workers\" is TRUE.

The CDC reported just over 1 million abortions in 1991 and 620,327 in 2020, looking at just the District of Columbia and the 47 states that reported figures in both years.\nA quarter of women who had abortions in 2020 had one previous live birth, 20% had two previous live births, 10% had three, and 6% had four or more previous live births. These CDC figures include data from 42 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York). The vast majority of abortions occur during the first trimester of a pregnancy.\nIn 2020, 93% of abortions occurred during the first trimester – that is, at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to the CDC. An additional 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, and 1% were performed at 21 weeks or more of gestation. These CDC figures include data from 40 states and New York City (but not the rest of New York).\nSome examples included providing additional state funds for women’s travel expenses and for abortion clinics that were expecting more out-of-state patients. In the 46 states that reported data to the CDC in 2020, the majority of women who had abortions (57%) were in their 20s, while about three-in-ten (31%) were in their 30s.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality - PMC\nContent:\nMore than one-third of all pregnancies are unintended, and 1 in 5 ends in abortion. In developing countries, two-thirds of unintended pregnancies occur among women who were not using any method of contraception.9 Greater contraceptive access and use alone can thus drastically reduce safe and unsafe abortion by reducing unintended pregnancies.\nUnsafe abortion is thus a pressing issue. Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion—less restrictive abortion laws and greater contraceptive use—face social, religious, and political obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions (97%) occur.\nThe median rate of unsafe abortions in the 82 countries with the most restrictive abortion laws is up to 23 of 1000 women compared with 2 of 1000 in nations that allow abortions.4 Abortion-related deaths are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (34 deaths per 100,000 childbirths) than in countries with less restrictive laws (1 or fewer per 100,000 childbirths).1\nLess restrictive abortion laws do not appear to entail more abortions overall. The world’s lowest abortion rates are in Europe, where abortion is legal and widely available but contraceptive use is high; in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, the rate is below 10 per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-11-25\nTitle: Abortion\nContent:\nOf all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e., by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods.Developing countries bear the burden of 97% of all unsafe abortions.

In Latin American and Africa, the majority (approximately 3 out of 4) of all abortions are unsafe. In Africa, nearly half of all abortions occur under the least safe circumstances (2).\nThe legal status of abortion can also affect children’s educational outcomes, and their earnings on the labour market later in life. For example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7).\nFor example, legalization of abortion – by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted – can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling (7).

The World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although \"garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,\" there's no evidence that \"eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus\":\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Multiple sources, including FactCheck.org, the Indian government's Press Information Bureau, and BOOM Live, have debunked the claim that freshly boiled garlic water can cure the novel coronavirus.\n* These debunking articles were published between early February and mid-March 2020.\n* No scientific evidence or medical research supports the claim that garlic boiled in water can cure the novel coronavirus.\n* Garlic does have some antimicrobial properties, but there is no evidence that eating garlic can protect against the new coronavirus.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that freshly boiled garlic water is a cure for the coronavirus is false. The claim was debunked by multiple reputable sources before the claim's publication date, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim. Additionally, the World Health Organization has specifically addressed and debunked this claim.", "response": "FALSE."}

A general internist mentioned that their health system decided to pay physicians and other employees for 8 weeks, until May 15, borrowing about $150 million to do so. Physicians are expected to receive base pay at their 2019 level during this period. However, the situation after May 15 is uncertain. Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, mentioned that it's hard to predict the future of the COVID-19 crisis.

But experts are clear that this is a hoax and that petrol pumps have not been found to be a source of contagion in any case. The hoax seems to have started in England, where Public Health officials have slammed it as fake.\n“ACAPMA encourages all members to share the clear and simple advice from the Department of Health that all people should, after touching any hard surface, avoid touching their face and wash their hands as soon as possible.

Claims coronavirus is spreading through petrol pumps have been rubbished by health professionals today. It was feared Covid-19 was moving “rapidly” down the pumps and infecting drivers across the country. WhatsApp messages and posts on social media suggested a senior NHS nurse had advised people to wear gloves at petrol garages.\nBut a Public Health England spokesperson offered some clarity on this saying the pumps offer no more exposure than any other surface. \"Petrol pumps are no worse than other surfaces, although we do recommend people use gloves and wash their hands after using them,” they said today.\nOne such message read: \"A senior nurse at the Queen Elizabeth believes the virus is spreading rapidly through people using petrol pumps. \"She asks that if you need to fill your car up use gloves or a paper towel and then bin them. Please pass this on.\" More than 5,000 cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in the UK. This figure includes the 233 deaths of patients who were tested positive. But the majority of those had underlying health conditions, such as severe respiratory problems.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-27, is an AFP fact-checking article that discusses a claim about Australia's Department of Health issuing a warning that using petrol pumps can spread COVID-19. The claim is false, and no such warning has been issued by Australian health authorities. The article mentions a post circulating on Facebook, claiming that hospitals have sent messages asking people to wear gloves or use paper towels when filling up at petrol stations to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nInformation 2, 3, and 4 are not primary sources but instead refer to the same hoax about petrol pumps spreading COVID-19. These articles mention that social media is filled with false claims about the virus spreading through petrol pumps and provide advice from health professionals and organizations, such as Public Health England and ACAPMA, that debunk this hoax.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-22, is an article from The Mirror discussing a similar hoax in the UK. The claim that COVID-19 is spreading through petrol pumps has been exposed as a social media hoax, and health professionals, including a Public Health England spokesperson, have clarified that petrol pumps are no worse than other surfaces regarding the spread of the virus.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that Australia's Department of Health issued a warning about petrol pumps spreading COVID-19 is false. No such warning has been issued by Australian health authorities. This claim has been debunked by Information 1, which is a reliable fact-checking source. Additionally, Information 2, 3, 4, and 5 support the claim's falsity, as they discuss similar hoaxes in other countries and provide statements from health professionals debunking these claims.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published after Information 1, which is a reliable fact-checking source. Information 1 explicitly states that the claim is false and that no such warning has been issued by Australian health authorities.

Suicide prevention strategies must be tailored to better address disparities in youth suicide risk.\nSchool settings can play an important role in suicide prevention by providing age-appropriate programs that reach a large and diverse number of youth. Although the impact of school closures on youth suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear, racial and ethnic disparities in access to in-person instruction have been documented during the pandemic, and the lack of live instruction has been associated with impaired academic progress, decreased physical activity, lower levels of social and emotional support, and greater emotional distress and exposure to in-home conflict.48 Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of school-based suicide prevention programs to increase mental health literacy, enhance awareness about suicide risk, and to decrease the incidence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation.49–51 Opportunities exist to continue adapting these programs to broaden their reach with on-line modes of instruction and delivery.\nA recent US Surgeon General’s Advisory provides further research recommendations to effectively respond to the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of the nation’s youth.58 A Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion–informed framework applied to the study and prevention of youth suicide also offers a promising approach to achieving health equity and reducing suicide risk for all youth.59,60 Examining geographic variations in youth suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic is another important opportunity for future research, and a comparative analysis across subgroups may also shed perspective on this study’s findings.\nFindings highlight the need to identify potential mechanisms underlying differential increases in youth suicide deaths associated with the pandemic and to develop broadened and more effective suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide. Additionally, preteen rates of suicide are increasing warranting further research and clinical attention for this understudied subpopulation at risk. Future research is needed to understand the impact of racial and ethnic disparities62 on emotional and mental health of young people, and to monitor longer-term trends of COVID-19-related suicide morbidity and mortality.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Rethinking Youth Suicide Prevention During COVID - WebMD\nContent:\n<strong>COVID</strong>-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases. Here’s a quick guide on how to spot symptoms, risk factors, <strong>prevent</strong> spread of the disease, and find out what to do if you think you have it.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During the COVID-19 Pandemic - National ...\nContent:\nIn a new study supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, researchers examined national youth suicide trends and characteristics in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A research team led by Jeffrey Bridge, Ph.D. , Donna Ruch, Ph.D. , and Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., MPH, analyzed national suicide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers first identified all U.S. youth aged 5 to 24 years with suicide listed as the cause of death over the first 10 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020–December 31, 2020).\nThe significantly higher number of suicide deaths reported for certain racial and ethnic groups, specifically non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black youth, highlights ongoing disparities in rates of suicide that the pandemic may have exacerbated. The increase in suicide deaths among preteens also suggests that more attention may need to be paid to this age group, who tend to be understudied in suicide prevention research and have different developmental needs than older adolescents and young adults.\nThis study shows that the pandemic impacted youth suicide rates, but the impact was not the same for everyone and varied based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity. As such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups.\nAs such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups. Moreover, given the extended duration of the pandemic and its ongoing impact on young people in the United States, it will be important to monitor long-term trends in suicide rates associated with COVID-19 and identify factors driving the increased risk for suicide among some people.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During COVID-19 Pandemic, Especially ...\nContent:\nData suggest depression, anxiety and social isolation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to suicide risk in youth.  · In a study published today in Pediatrics, researchers in the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital found that in the United States, youth suicides increased during COVID-19, with significantly more suicides than expected among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth.\nNational trends in suicides were sourced from the Web-based Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Individuals aged 5-24 years between 2015 and 2020 with suicide listed as the cause of death were included in this analysis. The start of the COVID-19 period was defined as March 2020.  · A total of 5,568 youth living in the United States died by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThis is a group of young people that typically have a very low rate of suicide relative to other young people, and to see an increase in their rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was a cause for concern,” said Donna Ruch, PhD, co-author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Suicide Prevention Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  · The findings of this study highlight the importance of suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide.\n“To our knowledge, no national study examined changes in youth suicide rates that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeffrey A Bridge, PhD, lead author of the study and director of the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “We wanted to a see if there were any changes in the youth suicide rate that occurred and whether these changes happened with the onset of the pandemic.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Suicide spectrum among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: ...\nContent:\nThird, from a wider perspective, the present work calls for urgent investments in the mental health area aimed at offering the young people easy and free access to the services, both in schools and in other public institutions, to enable the early detection of mental disorders and the prevention of the escalation into suicidality. However, literature about youth suicidality during COVID-19 is still expanding and further research is needed to clarify this complex clinical and public health issue.\nAfter the reopenings, we could have assisted to a sort of rebound, in which long-lasting COVID-19 related worries and a potentially hard adaptation to frequent social interactions after months of limitations could have strongly affected the most vulnerable youth's mental health. These findings have great relevance from both a clinical and a public health point of view. Understanding whether and how adolescents' mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can allow the implementation of tailored policies to prevent and control suicidal phenomena, and to improve the quality of life of this particularly susceptible population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2021, discusses a study on youth suicide during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that suicide deaths among US youth increased during COVID-19, with substantial variation by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and suicide method. School-based suicide prevention programs have been proven effective, and opportunities exist to adapt these programs to online modes of instruction and delivery. The US Surgeon General's Advisory provides further research recommendations to respond to the pandemic's impact on youth mental health.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2013, provides general information about COVID-19, its symptoms, risk factors, and prevention measures, but does not contain any relevant information about youth suicide prevention during COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published by the National Institute of Mental Health, discusses a study on youth suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that suicide deaths among US youth increased during COVID-19, with significant variations based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity.

The study found that in the United States, youth suicides increased during COVID-19, with significantly more suicides than expected among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth. The authors suggest that suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide are needed.\n\nInformation 5, published in a scientific journal, discusses the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people and the need for urgent investments in mental health services to enable early detection of mental disorders and prevention of suicidality. The study highlights the importance of understanding the impact of the pandemic on adolescents' mental health to implement tailored policies to prevent and control suicidal phenomena.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that it is necessary to rethink youth suicide prevention during COVID.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is TRUE. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of young people, leading to an increase in suicide rates among certain groups.

By July, the term “pandemic pod” exploded into the vernacular.\nFor Christina Jackson and the nine other parents in her pod, there is no such thing as a peaceful weekday morning anymore. The setting rotates: each day one of the five families offers up their West Philadelphia home as a temporary schoolhouse. The 8 o’clock hour is the most frantic — a mad dash of plugging in headphones, turning on surge protectors, and reconnecting to the Wi-Fi as the parents race to prepare six second-graders for another day of virtual lessons.\nThey reached out to Mainline Tutoring Collaborative, a tutoring service that had sprung up over the summer to connect parents and link them with private tutors to help their kids with virtual school.

It can last up to 15 days at maximum and only be extended, with no limit, by the authorization of the Congress.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nThe information provided consists of five pieces from various sources, discussing the Spanish state of alarm and its relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of alarm is regulated by Article 116 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and Organic Law 4/1981. The government can declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it.

Based on the provided information, the claim is partially correct. The Spanish government does declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it. However, the information does not explicitly state that the government \"asks Congress to renew the state of alarm every 15 days because it is required by law.\" Instead, it is implied that the government requests an extension after the initial 15-day period.\n\nConsidering the provided information and the publication date of the claim (2020-05-05), it is reasonable to assume that the claim is accurate, as the state of alarm was in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government would have needed to request extensions from the Congress of Deputies to maintain the state of alarm beyond the initial 15-day period.", "response": "FALSE."}

A temporary shortage of protective gear was an urgent threat in the early days of the outbreak that exposed medical workers and the public to a greater risk of infection.\nMoreover, on March 13, the WHO, the UN Foundation, and partners launched a first-of-its-kind COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which will go towards actions outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to enable all countries - and particularly those most vulnerable and at-risk, and with the weakest health systems - to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 crisis including rapidly detecting cases, stopping transmission of the virus, and caring for those affected. Donations amounting to more than US$ 108 million have been received from 203,000 individuals and organizations in just two weeks (11).

As COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, spreads around the world, numerous false and misleading claims of “cures” for the virus are spreading on social media.\nThe post also claims that this “cure” is the reason that the “People of Israel is relaxed” about COVID-19. Actually, the Israeli government has issued emergency regulations that include reducing entry to the public space, imposing responsibility on employers, closing non-essential stores and imposing restrictions on public transport, as well as “home isolation” guidelines. The post’s “recipe” for the phony cure includes lemon and bicarbonate — short for sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which is commonly used as an antacid.\n“There’s no data that shows using lemon juice or hot tea or anything like that would kill a virus,” she said. Angela Rogers, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center, noted in an email that “there is nothing that has been shown yet to kill or eliminate COVID-19 virus, and it’s still not clear whether any other therapies in the news (steroids, targeted immune modulators, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine) are actually helpful.”\nIn reality, as of April 2, more than 6,800 people in Israel have tested positive for COVID-19, and 36 have died. Over 100 people were in serious condition and 83 were on life support. The post also claims that this “cure” is the reason that the “People of Israel is relaxed” about COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-26\nTitle: Build Your Immunity to Fight Covid: Lemon juice in warm water - ...\nContent:\nAs the <strong>Covid</strong>-<strong>19</strong> pandemic rages on, with the healthcare system almost on the brink of collapse, people are looking towards easy and homemade immunity boosters.

Lemon juice will not prevent or cure a COVID-19 infection, no matter what is mixed with it. Consuming acidic drinks like lemon juice has no effect on coronavirus infections. Viral infections spread in your body when viruses enter your cells and make copies of themselves and then those copies enter new cells and repeat the process.\nDrinking the juice hot, with or without baking soda, also will not prevent you from getting COVID-19 or destroy the virus if you are already infected. The same goes for boiling lemon peels in water and inhaling the steam.\nAspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation.

That means the studies will be randomized, controlled trials, in which some of the patients in each study will get blood plasma with COVID-19 antibodies while others will get regular plasma without antibodies (a placebo).\nWEDNESDAY, May 13, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- Could blood plasma drawn from people who've recovered from COVID-19 help prevent new coronavirus infections or ease symptoms in those already infected? Two groups of researchers aim to find out. One clinical trial, from doctors at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, will try to determine whether \"convalescent plasma\" injected into hospitalized COVID-19 patients can protect them from developing severe disease or requiring a ventilator.\nCOVID-19 survivor Domenico Piccininni, 50, donated his plasma in late April at Atlanta's Northside Hospital. He hopes his antibodies can help kick-start the immune systems of people made very ill by coronavirus. \"My wife volunteered me,\" he said, laughing. \"I've never even donated blood before.\nThe two main ones are the patient catching an infectious disease, though blood screening helps to lessen that possibility, or a patient's immune system reacting badly to the injected plasma of another person. Grudzen noted that, \"especially in older people, it's a little more risky.\" And Casadevall cautioned that plasma therapy still needs to be tested on COVID-19 to see if it'll work against this specific virus, \"simply because it's a new organism.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: FDA to allow COVID-19 treatments with blood from survivors | Fierce ...\nContent:\nThe FDA unlocked the use of convalescent plasma—derived from the donated blood of people that have recovered from COVID-19 and which may contain helpful antibodies—as an investigational t | The FDA unlocked the use of convalescent plasma—derived from the donated blood of people that have recovered from COVID-19 and which may contain helpful antibodies—as an investigational treatment for patients with severe cases of the disease.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-03-28\nTitle: Plasma of COVID-19 Survivors Could Save Lives - The Atlantic\nContent:\nThe day before Prowell tweeted her plea, the Food and Drug Administration began allowing doctors to use plasma, the yellow fluid in which blood cells are suspended, as a Hail Mary to treat very ill COVID-19 patients. The idea of using plasma from survivors, also known as convalescent-plasma therapy, dates back to the late 19th century. Doctors have transfused the blood of recovered patients into those still sick with the 1918 flu, measles, polio, chickenpox, SARS, and Ebola—to varying degrees of success. Given the dearth of treatments for COVID-19, convalescent plasma has gained new prominence.\nGiven the dearth of treatments for COVID-19, convalescent plasma has gained new prominence. The blood of survivors, the thinking goes, contains proteins called antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus. Early data from very small numbers of COVID-19 patients in China show some promise.\nSo doctors, scientists, blood banks, and government agencies have begun mobilizing to collect, distribute, and study plasma from COVID-19 survivors. The advantage of plasma is that you don’t need to develop a vaccine or treatment from scratch. But in these early days of the pandemic, when the number of recovered and confirmed patients is still relatively small, finding them will take time.\nThey should have had a lab test confirming COVID-19, which is hard to get now and was even harder to get when the donors would have first gotten sick, several weeks ago. And, as with normal blood donation, patients and donors have to be matched by blood type.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Does Blood Plasma from COVID-19 Survivors Help Patients ...\nContent:\nCP therapy involves infusing patients with antibodies extracted from the blood of donors who have successfully recovered from COVID-19, with the hope that the resulting boost to their immune systems will shorten the length and reduce the severity of the disease.

The ACTRI is providing personnel, infrastructure support and other resources for the CP trial and for other COVID-19-related clinical trials at UC San Diego.\nAnd one treatment that is more than a century old. Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and UC San Diego Health have launched a clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) to prevent COVID-19 after a known exposure to the virus.

As Bruce Aylward, a prominent epidemiologist with the WHO, puts it, “This is one of the most serious diseases you will face in your lifetime.” · If the Ebola trial—carried out in under a year in a war-torn country—is the current record for testing an outbreak treatment, the world hopes to beat that mark now.\nIn what public health experts say could be a model for how to battle covid-19, a trial was carried out involving 673 patients to compare four treatments. It was less than a year later, Kyratsous says, in August of 2019, that he received a call saying the trial was being halted. It wasn’t a failure; rather, it was too much of a success. Regeneron’s antibody cocktail and one from the NIH (based on an antibody collected from a survivor of a 1995 outbreak) worked so well that it would be unethical not to give them to every patient.\nIf the right antibody can be found, manufactured, and bottled, it could be among the first treatments for covid-19.

They were negative. She also said that no antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus had been found. The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.

But Hassad adds he believes that this lab-leak theory is on the “extreme low end” of possibilities, and it “will quite likely remain only theoretical following any proper scientific investigation,” he says.\nNewly reported information has revived scrutiny of this possible origin for the coronavirus, which experts still call unlikely though worth investigating. ...

It mentions the work of Shi Zhengli and her team at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who have been studying coronaviruses in bats. The article explains that Shi's lab fully sequenced RaTG13 in 2018 and tested workers' serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, with negative results.\n\nInformation 2 (No date): This is a brief mention of Nature examining arguments that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab in China and the science behind them.\n\nInformation 3 (2023-03-08): This source describes a hearing by the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability regarding COVID origins. It does not provide specific details about the content of the hearing.\n\nInformation 4 (No date): This source explains the more plausible lab-leak hypothesis, in which the Wuhan laboratory isolated the novel coronavirus from an animal and it accidentally escaped.

Novavax is available under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization. MF59 MF59 is the adjuvant contained in Fluad quadrivalent (an influenza vaccine licensed and recommended for adults aged 65 or older).\nAdjuvanted vaccines can cause more local reactions (such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and more systemic reactions (such as fever, chills and body aches) than non-adjuvanted vaccines. Aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum potassium sulfate have been used safely in vaccines for more than 70 years.

Adjuvants are critical components of both subunit and certain inactivated vaccines because they induce specific immune responses that are more robust and long-lasting.\nIn previously reported exploratory and pre-clinical CoV vaccine studies, adjuvants such as aluminum salts, emulsions, and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, have been used in vaccine formulations for studies with various animal models ( Table 1 ). The adjuvants AS03, MF59, and CpG 1018 have already been used in licensed vaccines (28) and have been committed by GlaxoSmithKline, Seqirus, and Dynavax to be available for COVID-19 vaccine development (29). When combined with subunit and specific inactivated antigens (30, 31), adjuvants with various characteristics elicit distinctive immunological profiles with regard to the direction, duration, and strength of immune responses. Thus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32).\nThus far, there are at least 40 candidate vaccines in clinical trials and 149 vaccines in preclinical evaluation, of which 67 subunit and 15 inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have being developed (32). Among these adjuvants, alum have been formulated with S protein or RBD to induce neutralizing antibody production (17, 18), which has suggested to be associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 (15, 16, 24).\nOther adjuvants, e.g., emulsion adjuvants and TLR agonists, which have been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses could be more favorable. However, no phase III clinical trial results of COVID-19 vaccines are published so far, thus, there is no direct evidence to indicate which type of immune response induced by vaccine plays a more critical protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How a new vaccine adjuvant might help to shorten race to COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nDifferent adjuvants also trigger different sensing pathways in our immune system.

Does that not solve the problem for vaccines against the novel coronavirus?\nBecause if you have an existing vaccine that already has an adjuvant that may be active, but perhaps weak, if you combine it with a bisphosphonate, you would expect to see synergistic activity. In fact, we tried bisphosphonate in combination with readily available vaccines, and we saw, indeed, that there was an amplification of the antibody immune response to those vaccines. What we are now trying to explore in animal models is, could we basically use bisphosphonate to turbocharge whatever COVID-19 vaccines may come online, hopefully within a year or so.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adjuvants for COVID-19 Vaccines - PMC\nContent:\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination focused on mRNA-type and viral vector vaccines.

When the drug enters your bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate, Dr. Shaw explains. The coronavirus uses RNA as its genetic material.\nNote: Since this story about Merck’s molnupiravir was originally published, the Food and Drug Administration has provided emergency use authorizations for pills from both Merck and Pfizer. Scientists continue to study the real-world effectiveness of both. Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nOver the past year, discussions—sometimes heated ones—about ending the COVID-19 pandemic have largely focused on the availability, effectiveness, and safety of vaccines. But in December 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for two pills that patients can take at home in the days after COVID-19 symptoms arise to prevent severe disease and avoid going to the hospital.\nIt’s important to note that the pill is meant to be taken after you’ve experienced COVID-19 symptoms.

Some social media posts circulating on Monday suggested Yeadon’s opinions were credible because of his former role as a chief scientist of allergy & respiratory research at Pfizer.\nCLAIM: The COVID-19 pandemic is “effectively over” and there’s no need for vaccines. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The claim, made in an article by a former employee at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, ignores that large numbers of people continue to fall ill and die from the coronavirus in many parts of the world. The United Kingdom, which is the subject of the article, saw a surge in coronavirus cases this fall and exceeded 50,000 coronavirus-related deaths earlier this month.\nAnd thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of COVID-19-related deaths are still being reported daily in the U.K., where Yeadon is based. Yeadon argues a larger portion of the population is immune to the coronavirus than government scientists assume because many people have previously been infected by different common cold-producing coronaviruses.\nTHE FACTS: A former Pfizer employee’s inflammatory claims denying global data are gaining traction on social media this week as the pharmaceutical company seeks FDA authorization to distribute its coronavirus vaccine. It started when Michael Yeadon, a retired British doctor, wrote an op-ed in October on a U.K.-based blog opposing government restrictions for the coronavirus. In the article, Yeadon wrote that the “pandemic is effectively over” and could “easily be handled” by the U.K.’s National Health Service if it were “properly functioning.” He also said there was “no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.”\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-27\nTitle: Ex-Pfizer Vice President’s claim ‘COVID is effectively over’ ...\nContent:\nThe video features a conversation between talk show host Julia Hartley-Brewer and Yeadon in which the former Pfizer VP made the similar claim that \"the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.\" According to Health Feedback, the video contains several inaccurate claims about the pandemic that were previously debunked by the organisation and other fact-checkers. Challenging Yeadon's claims, Health Feedback said that several European countries, including the UK, experienced a resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths starting in September and October. In the article published in Lockdown Sceptics, Yeadon made claims about a large section of the population having prior immunity against the disease.\nAfter drugmaker Pfizer's former Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy and Respiratory Michael Yeadon claimed that \"the pandemic is fundamentally over in the UK,\" health fact-checker Health Feedback termed his assertions \"false\". In an article published in Lockdown Sceptics (lockdownsceptics.org) on October 16, Yeadon claimed that the \"the susceptible population (in the UK) is now sufficiently depleted and the immune population sufficiently large that there will not be another large, national scale outbreak of COVID-19.\"\nPfizer last week said that it is seeking emergency approval from US regulators for its COVID-19 vaccine, which has shown 95 percent efficacy in a totality of two data sets.

Inaccurate: Between September and early November 2020, there was a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.K, and this trend will likely persist for some time. The claim that “the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” is false.\nYeadon: “I am saying the pandemic is fundamentally over in the U.K.” · The suggestion that COVID-19 PCR testing produces false positives as a result of “cross-reacting” and detecting common cold coronaviruses is unsupported. As this previous Health Feedback review explained, the PCR test for COVID-19 is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and does not detect coronaviruses that cause the common cold. Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is “over in the U.K.” is contradicted by data from both the U.K. government and Our World in Data showing that there is a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.K., going from below 5,000 in September to about 25,000 in November (Figure 2).\n\nThe claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is \"fundamentally over\" in the U.K. and that \"we now know loads of people had prior immunity to COVID-19\" was made in November 2020. However, this claim is false based on the available information and current understanding of the pandemic.\n\nAt the time the claim was made, there was a spike in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.K. This trend was expected to persist for some time, contradicting the claim that the pandemic was \"fundamentally over.\"\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that some people who have never had COVID-19 have a certain type of immune cell (memory T cell) that can recognize SARS-CoV-2, the implications for immunity are still unknown. More studies are needed to determine the role of memory T cells in immunity to COVID-19. A person's antiviral immune response is comprised of several components, including antibodies, which can bind to certain proteins on the surface of the virus and prevent it from infecting cells. One of the key goals of COVID-19 vaccines is to stimulate the production of antibodies that prevent infection.\n\nIt is important to note that the claim was made by Michael Yeadon, a former scientific advisor to Pfizer. However, his opinions should not be considered credible solely based on his former role. Scientific claims should be based on peer-reviewed research and data, not on the opinions of a single individual.\n\nIn summary, the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is \"fundamentally over\" in the U.K. and that \"we now know loads of people had prior immunity to COVID-19\" is false based on the available information and current understanding of the pandemic. It is important to rely on accurate and up-to-date information from reputable sources to make informed decisions about COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

As using face masks could be a long‐term preventive measure in the COVID‐19 era, further studies are needed, particularly to explore the impact on pre‐existing respiratory problems in children and adults.\nSurgical or medical masks are recommended by international and national institutions in order to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID‐19. 1 , 2 , 3 In some countries, these are supported by government regulations. There is evidence that wearing masks has produced additional benefits, including the reduction in other viral diseases, such as influenza.\nOur mini review only found one paediatric study, and eight adult studies, which explored the medical parameters of mask wearing, and these did not report any harmful effects. Further studies are needed so that evidence‐based recommendations can be produced for different age groups. Face masks have become a crucial part of everyday life across the globe since COVID‐19 was declared a pandemic.

In fact, the mask allows oxygen to properly flow in and around it while protecting your child from coming in contact with spit, coughs, sneezes, or other airborne particles that could carry the COVID-19 virus. Preventing or limiting the spread of COVID-19 with masks is one way to make sure your child’s lungs stay healthy.\nPreventing or limiting the spread of COVID-19 with masks is one way to make sure your child’s lungs stay healthy. Not at all. Wearing masks won’t compromise your child’s immunity or increase their risk of catching COVID-19 or other infections.

In fact, because face masks cover your nose and mouth, they stop your child from constantly touching their face. It cuts down on several infections, including COVID-19, that are spread through touch, droplets from bodily fluids, or through the air.\nFace masks have become an essential tool to protect yourself and others from the COVID-19 infection and limit its spread. Under the CDC’s guidance, many communities have relaxed some of their recommendations regarding COVID-19 preventive measures like masking when there are low COVID-19 transmission rates, low hospital admission rates, and adequate hospital capacity in their area.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Masked education? The benefits and burdens of wearing face masks ...\nContent:\nThis measure could contribute greatly to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, with the benefit greatest in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical interventions [such as physical distancing] that reduce community transmission” ([26], p. 305). German pediatricians have voiced a similar opinion [76]. However, in the light of what has been discussed so far, this can hardly be the final verdict, when it comes to wearing face masks at school to prevent the spread of the present corona pandemic.\nAs regards the prevention of Covid-19, additional concerns of wearing face masks have been articulated, for example: ... Wearing a face mask may give a false sense of security and may make people less compliant with other infection control measures. ... Because of problems with understanding speech (see below), people may move closer together, without intention, and thereby increase infection risk.\nDuring the time of school-closures (from about the middle of March into April and/or May 2020) it became clear that face masks covering mouth and nose in closed public spaces (public transportation, stores, restaurants etc.) are an effective means of preventing the spread of the virus and thus, the worsening of the pandemic. This had not been clear at the time when the pandemic started in most countries (February 2020), as institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and, for example, the German Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI), as well as many governments across the globe, did not recommend the use of face masks to fight Covid-19.4\nA natural experiment published on June 16th 2020 used the different timing (between April 8 and May 15) of state policies mandating public or community use of face masks or covers in 15 US states plus DC in mitigating covid-19 spread [52]. The study found that the changes in the daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates between March 31, 2020 and May 22, 2020, was associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 2% by two to three weeks after the mandatory face mask use.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in a mini-review, discusses the impact of face masks on children and adults, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory problems. The review found no harmful effects in one paediatric study and eight adult studies. However, the authors suggest further studies are needed to produce evidence-based recommendations for different age groups. Surgical or medical masks are recommended by international and national institutions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, from the Mayo Clinic, explains that face masks can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It provides information on mask types and usage.\n\nInformation 3, from Nemours KidsHealth, explains that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. They also prevent people from touching their mouths and faces, reducing the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 4, from KidsHealth, states that wearing masks for long periods at school won't affect a child's lung development. Masks allow oxygen to flow properly and protect the child from coming in contact with airborne particles that could carry the COVID-19 virus. Masks also reduce the risk of several infections spread through touch, droplets from bodily fluids, or through the air.\n\nInformation 5, from a study published in 2020, found that changes in daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates were associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 2% two to three weeks after the mandatory face mask use.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that wearing face masks to help stop the spread of COVID-19 will cause children physical and psychological problems is false. The information provided supports the use of face masks for children and adults to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. No harmful effects of wearing face masks were found in the studies reviewed. In fact, masks protect children from coming in contact with airborne particles that could carry the COVID-19 virus and reduce the risk of several infections spread through touch, droplets from bodily fluids, or through the air. Additionally, masks do not affect a child's lung development or immunity. The natural experiment published in 2020 found that mandatory face mask use was associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate.

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020–February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1).

National COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19.\nNational COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19.

Fluctuations in symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic highlight the importance of real-time monitoring of mental health symptoms.\nFifth, the decrease in the frequency of symptoms observed through June 2021 occurred before the recent surge in COVID-19 cases involving the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; that decreasing trend might have slowed or reversed since June. Finally, these data are based on self-report and are subject to recall and social desirability biases.

In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered.

The UP government and Congress have exchanged at least 9 letters over the matter. The UP government released data showing that the Congress provided 351 buses, out of which 271 were allowed to enter UP after passing the fitness test. An FIR has been filed against Priyanka Gandhi's secretary, Sandeep Singh, for alleged discrepancies in the list of buses.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-05-18, states that the Uttar Pradesh government accepted Priyanka Gandhi's request to allow the Congress to run 1,000 buses to ferry migrants.

However, Information 1 and 4 suggest that there were discrepancies in the list of buses provided by the Congress, leading to an FIR against Priyanka Gandhi's secretary. Additionally, Information 1 indicates that only 351 buses were provided, out of which 271 were allowed to enter UP. Therefore, it can be said that Priyanka Gandhi attempted to arrange 1,000 buses, but only a portion of that number was ultimately provided and allowed to enter UP.", "response": "FALSE."}

First of all, the letter has a number of sloppy mistakes, highlighted by each (sic) above. It also claims to be sent from the Office of the Taoiseach. Dr Tony Holohan is not the Taoiseach. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan also told a briefing this evening at the Department of Health that it was a fake.\nLike most hoaxes, on first glance it may appear real – referring to the Office of the Taoiseach and Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan – but real news about when pubs can reopen will be disseminated through multiple channels and after consultation with vintners representative bodies such as ourselves.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-17\nTitle: Dr Tony Holohan says letter asking pubs not to open until September ...\nContent:\nThe fraudulent message which has a signature supposed to be that of the Chief Medical Officer and is headed 'Office of the Taoiseach', has been widely circulated on WhatsApp. It claims that pubs will be asked to remain shut until September 1st - but is completely fake.

If you're in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nCOVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person. People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection. The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.\nIn general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Controlling Chronic Lung Diseases Amid COVID-19 | American Lung ...\nContent:\nHaving a chronic lung disease means that you can be more likely to get severely ill and have complications from COVID-19.

Even after the disease has passed, lung injury may result in breathing difficulties that might take months to improve.\nAlso, make sure that your chronic health conditions are managed as well as they can be. For example, people living with diabetes, COPD or heart disease should be especially careful to manage those conditions with monitoring and taking their medications as directed.”\nFinally, he stresses, being vaccinated and boosted appropriately at the time of the infection helps ensure the best possible outcome.  “While the vaccine’s immunity makes our immune systems ʻsmarter’ by having a ʻplay book’ to fight off the virus strategically with minimal collateral damage, the vaccine’s immunity may also help in the healing process as well. Abnormal healing is seen often in people who have not previously been vaccinated.\n“As we have learned more about SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19, we have discovered that in severe COVID-19, a significant pro-inflammatory condition can result in several critical diseases, complications and syndromes,” Galiatsatos says.

Tea brings a number of health benefits including improving insulin sensitivity.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The Effects of Green Tea on Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes - PMC\nContent:\nThe study presents the results of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that γ-PGA can interact with EGCG, and this possible complex formation may delay the absorption of GCs to systemic circulation from the intestine, resulting in decreased blood glucose level.\nTherefore, they suggest that GTE+γ-PGA treatment may be a promising preventative and therapeutic tool for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Future studies, especially in human, are warranted to confirm these benefits in patients with diabetes or healthy subjects, as well as to define the precise molecular mechanisms of action of green tea supplementation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Green tea may help stabilize blood sugar levels due to its 0 calorie content and polyphenol antioxidants. It contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which has a calming effect and may help reduce anxiety and stress-related increases in blood pressure.\n2. A literature review suggests that green tea may be helpful for weight loss as part of a healthy eating plan, but more well-controlled human studies are needed. Some studies show green tea benefits for those with diabetes, but results are mixed due to genetics, gender, type of tea leaves used, and bioavailability of active ingredients.\n3. Green tea catechins have been shown to have various biological activities, including antioxidation and modulation of cellular lipid and proteins. They may be beneficial against degenerative diseases, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various inflammatory diseases. However, chronic consumption of green tea may result in adverse effects, and interindividual variations in the green tea effect are large.\n4. Teas such as black tea, green tea, and oolong tea contain polyphenols, which may increase insulin activity. Drinking two cups of tea each day could help you live longer, and green tea and coffee have been found to reduce the risk of death among type 2 diabetes. Polyphenols have anti-oxidative properties which can help protect against inflammation and carcinogens.\n5. A study suggests that GTE+γ-PGA treatment may be a promising preventative and therapeutic tool for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The possible complex formation of γ-PGA and EGCG may delay the absorption of GCs to systemic circulation from the intestine, resulting in decreased blood glucose level.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that \"Coffee, Green Tea May Help Against Type 2 Diabetes\" is likely true, but with some caveats. Green tea has been shown to have various benefits for those with type 2 diabetes, including increased insulin activity, weight loss, and reduced risk of death. However, more well-controlled human studies are needed to confirm these benefits, and chronic consumption of green tea may result in adverse effects. Coffee has not been mentioned explicitly in the provided information, but tea has been shown to reduce the risk of death among type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the claim should be more specific to green tea rather than both coffee and green tea.", "response": "TRUE."}

South Africa received the country’s first shipment of the vaccine at the start of February — a total of one million doses just as President Cyril Ramaphosa said the second wave of Covid-19 had “passed the peak”.\nThe vaccine sent to South Africa is licensed for production by AstraZeneca to a number of pharmaceutical companies around the world, including the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker by volume. The SII supplied South Africa with its first consignment.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-02\nTitle: Hoax advert for Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials circulates across ...\nContent:\nIts AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine or AZD1222 vaccine is widely regarded as one of the world's most advanced experimental Covid-19 vaccines in development, with trials underway in the US, Britain, South Africa, Brazil and Japan, according to this AFP report. The image was also shared here and here on Facebook; here and here on Twitter; here on Naver, alongside similar claims. However, the claim is false. AstraZeneca Korea published this statement on October 28, 2020 denying the claim.\nAn image purporting to show a recruitment advertisement by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Korea for participants in a paid Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms in South Korea. However, this claim is false: AstraZeneca Korea published a statement denying the claims, and South Korea’s National Institute of Health told AFP that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccines have not been approved for clinical testing in the country.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-03-30\nTitle: False claim circulates online in Thailand about coronavirus vaccine ...\nContent:\nThe claim is false. As of March 2021, Thailand is vaccinating essential workers and other groups with more than 100,000 jabs from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac imported for emergency use.\nAs Thailand launched its coronavirus vaccination drive, a claim circulated on Facebook and messaging app Line in late March 2021 that all adults aged over 19 could receive the jab in the Thai capital Bangkok. The claim is false: as of March 30, 2021, a top official in Thailand’s disease control department told AFP that Covid-19 vaccines would only initially be available to people in certain risk groups.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 Vaccine ...\nContent:\nOur apologies.

The claim suggests that the vaccine is not produced in India and that the South African president and health minister are hiding a Chinese link to an unsafe vaccine. This claim likely stems from AstraZeneca's partnership with a Chinese drugmaker, Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products, which will be the exclusive manufacturer of the vaccine in mainland China. The first 1.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines for South Africa are expected in January and February 2021, manufactured in India.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-11, discusses a Facebook post sharing misleading claims about the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa. The post mentions Switzerland suspending approval for the vaccine, but this is false, as they only requested more trial data. The vaccine was developed in partnership by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and supplied to South Africa by the Serum Institute of India.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-11-02, debunks a false claim about an AstraZeneca Korea recruitment advertisement for a paid Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial. AstraZeneca Korea denied the claims, and South Korea's National Institute of Health confirmed that AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccines have not been approved for clinical testing in the country.\n\nInformation 4, with no publication date, discusses a false claim circulating in Thailand about all adults being able to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. As of March 2021, Thailand is vaccinating essential workers and other groups with more than 100,000 jabs from AstraZeneca and Sinovac.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2021-01-26, states that a false claim is circulating in South Africa linking the AstraZeneca vaccine to China. The provided information supports this claim, as there have been multiple instances of false claims regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, Thailand, and South Korea. These false claims can create confusion and mistrust in the vaccine, which is essential to combat the pandemic. It is important to rely on accurate information from trusted sources to make informed decisions about vaccination.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is considered TRUE.", "response": "FALSE."}

It wasn’t. There are many human coronaviruses, and these products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold.\nIn terms of the disinfectants, testing is required for manufacturers to make claims about their products.

Similarly, some Lysol products — including disinfectant and multi-purpose sprays and wipes— have shown effectiveness against similar viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces, per a statement from Lysol.

On 10 August 2022, IEBC announced that 14 million Kenyans, who were identified electronically, had voted bringing the total percentage to 65.4%.\nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced plans to roll out the first phase of a 30-day mass voter registration exercise beginning 4 October 2021. The exercise targeted between 6 and 7 million new voters. However, with the home stretch of voter registration approaching, the commission raised concerns over its failure to reach its target.\nIEBC registered all aspirants expected to run for the various elective seats between 29 May and 7 June 2022. William Ruto and Raila Odinga were cleared on 4 and 5 June respectively, in an event that would see them present their nomination papers.\nSonko filed a petition at the High Court to have it compel IEBC to clear him for the gubernatorial race. On 13 July 2022, the court noted in its ruling that Sonko's impeachment case was yet to be determined by the Supreme Court, and ordered the electoral commission to clear Sonko to vie for the Mombasa governorship.\nGeneral elections were held in Kenya on Tuesday, 9 August 2022. Voters elected the president, governors, senators, members of the National Assembly, and members of county assemblies. This was the third general election and the fourth presidential one since the promulgation of the 2010 constitution.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission\nContent:\n<strong>IEBC</strong> - Independent <strong>Electoral</strong> and Boundaries <strong>Commission</strong>\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2022-09-19\nTitle: Seven Takeaways from Kenya’s Consequential Election – Africa ...\nContent:\nIts parallel vote tabulation (PVT) produced almost similar results to that of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) with a margin of error of between 0.1 and 2.1 percent. ELOG deployed 5,000 observers in all 47 counties, covering 47,000 polling stations. An additional 1,000 PVT monitors crunched incoming data from the IEBC portal in real time. Complementing the PVT, for the first time in Kenya—and possibly Africa—IEBC data released from the polling stations was accessible to the public. This allowed Kenyan media to run their own tallies and release provisional results 72 hours before the IEBC.\nThis overturned the practice of vesting sweeping powers in the IEBC Chair to alone “confirm, alter, vary, and/or verify the presidential election results.” The Kiai Petition was upheld in its entirely in August 2017 by the Court of Appeals, Kenya’s highest court, rejecting a government appeal. The Supreme Court decision to overturn the 2017 elections was based on this petition. While doubts over the autonomy of Kenya’s judiciary persist, with many Kenyans saying at least some of the country’s judges are corrupt, Kenya’s upper courts have painstakingly established institutional traditions of independence irrespective of their composition.\nThis allowed Kenyan media to run their own tallies and release provisional results 72 hours before the IEBC. Armed with this data, they also provided 24-hour analysis of the polls, setting a new norm worth emulating.

The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 113,000 deaths, in mid-June, as state governments considered how to prevent the spread of the disease in schools once a vaccine is available.\nBut a meme circulating on Facebook and other versions on social media claim the bill does not give parents any opportunity to avoid vaccinations for their children. “My heart is with Colorado!” the meme reads. “They passed bill SB-163 removing exemptions for vaccines. Very horrendous bill. Students must take Flu, HPV AND COVID19 vaccine to attend school.” The HPV vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus. That’s wrong on several counts. First, the bill has not become law yet. As we noted, the current version must still be approved by the Colorado Senate and then be signed by the governor.\nIt is also not true that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines or that “students must take” vaccines “to attend school.” · Colorado state law currently requires any student under 18 to submit a certificate of immunization, a doctor-certified medical exemption, or a statement of religious or personal belief that bars immunization. The new bill makes no changes as to who can choose to exempt their children and does not take away the opportunity to claim an exemption based on “a religious belief whose teachings are opposed to immunizations or a personal belief that is opposed to immunizations.”\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vaccine exemptions | Department of Public Health & Environment\nContent:\nColorado law requires all students attending Colorado schools and licensed child cares to be vaccinated against certain diseases unless they have a certificate of medical or nonmedical exemption on file.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he praised Hanks for doing \"a superb job of carrying Cast Away all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time\" by \"never straining for effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.\"\nThe second episode of the seventh season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, \"The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\" refers to a Cast Away scene.

Doria resigned the office of mayor in April 2018 to run for Governor of São Paulo.\nJoão Agripino da Costa Doria Júnior was born in São Paulo, the son of an advertising professional and federal deputy João Doria and businesswoman Maria Sylvia Vieira de Moraes Dias. From his paternal family, he is a descendant of the aristocratic Doria family of Genoa, specifically the Costa Doria Family branch, that migrated to Colonial Brazil in 1549, and become one of the richest in Bahia, owing its wealth to the ownership of Engenhos and slaves.\nFollowing the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, Doria's father was ousted from the Chamber of Deputies for supporting leftist president João Goulart.

The approach of Leffler et al. (29) was replicated by Goldman Sachs for both US and international regions, finding that face masks have a large reduction effect on infections and fatalities, and estimating a potential impact on US GDP of 1 trillion dollars if a nationwide mask mandate were implemented (32). Although between-region comparisons do not allow for direct causal attribution, they suggest mask wearing to be a low-risk measure with a potentially large positive impact.\nHowever, masks were far less effective at blocking rhinovirus particles of any size, or of blocking small influenza particles. The results suggest that masks may have a significant role in source control for the current coronavirus outbreak. The study did not use COVID-19 patients, and it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves the same as these seasonal coronaviruses, which are of the same family. In a pair of studies from 1962 to 1975, a portable isolation box was attached to an Andersen Sampler and used to measure orally expelled bacterial contaminants before and after masking.\nIn a study of the effect of mask use on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, masks were found to be highly effective, including for children, and the secondary attack rate for children was found to be only half that of adults. However, the impact of masks on children was not compared to adults (10). Some researchers have proposed that face shields may be appropriate in some environments (132), but it has not been well studied.\nHomemade masks worn by sick people can also reduce transmission through droplets.” One preprint systematic review (19) including epidemiological, theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence found that “face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.” On the other hand, a preprint systematic review that only included RCTs and observational studies (20) concluded, based on the RCTs, that there was only weak evidence for a small effect from mask use in the community, but that the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural ...\nContent:\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.

In 1948, there was rising agitation in East Bengal against the omission of Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz Khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of repression while charging protesters.\nOn 23 June 1949, Bengali nationalists from East Bengal broke away from the Muslim League, Pakistan's dominant political party, and established the All Pakistan Awami Muslim League. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Shamsul Huq were elected the first president and general secretary of the party respectively, Ataur Rahman Khan was elected the vice-president, Yar Mohammad Khan was elected as the treasurer, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and A. K. Rafiqul Hussain were elected the party's first joint secretaries. The party was formed to champion the rights of the masses in Pakistan against the powerful feudal establishment led by the Muslim League.\nVeteran student leader and language movement stalwart Khaleque Nawaz Khan defeated incumbent prime minister of the then East Bengal Mr. Nurul Amin in a landslide margin. Mr. Nurul Amin was defeated in his home Nandail constituency. Khaleque Nawaz Khan created history at age 27 by defeating sitting prime minister and Muslim League was wiped out from political landscape of the then East Pakistan. A. K. Fazlul Huq assumed the office of Chief Minister of East Bengal and drew up a cabinet containing many of the prominent student activists that were leading movements against the Pakistani state.\nInspiring from Soviet and Indian economic models, Awami League under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman implemented an economic system based on strict protectionism, state intervention and economic regulation under a planned economy and limited market activities, which was characterized as \"neither capitalist nor socialist\" in nature. Since Sheikh Hasina became the leader of Awami League in 1981, the party begun espousing more economically liberal positions, and has moved closer to the centre of the political spectrum. In 1991, AL president and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina noted that socialism was a failed system.\nThe Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ আওয়ামী লীগ, romanized: Bānglādēsh Awāmī Līg, lit.

After 1971 in Pakistan (West) the PPP led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took power. 1977 Bhutto was removed by General Ziaul Haq through a coup. 1988, after the death of Pakistan's military ruler and later civilian President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a new Muslim League was formed under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, but it had no connection with the original Muslim League.\nThe Muslim League was the original successor of the All-India Muslim League that led the Pakistan Movement to achieve an independent nation. Five of the country's Prime Ministers have been affiliated with this party, namely Liaquat Ali Khan, Khwaja Nazimuddin, M. A. Bogra, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, and I. I. Chundrigar. The Muslim League was defeated in the 1955 elections to the Constituent Assembly by a political alliance known as the United Front.\nThe All-India Muslim League was disbanded in December 1947 and succeeded by two organisations, the Muslim League and the Indian Union Muslim League, the first being its original successor in Pakistan. Jinnah resigned as the president of the Muslim League on 17 December and the two Muslim Leagues respectively elected Ch. Khaliquzzaman as President of the Muslim League (Pakistan) and Muhammad Ismail as the president for Indian Union Muslim League.\nThe party was dissolved in 1958 after the declaration of Martial Law by General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the Commander-in-Chief of Pakistan Army. ...

The average daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases during the study period was 8.3% in prisons, compared with 3.4% in the general population.\nThis largely comes down to age. Just 3% of the prison population is 65 years old or above compared with 16% of the U.S. population. This age group accounted for the majority of deaths from COVID-19 in the general population.\nA new analysis of COVID-19 in prisons in the United States finds that the number of cases is five times higher, and the number of adjusted deaths is three times higher than in the general population. ...

COVID-19 has highlighted the relationship between incarceration and health, but prior work has not explored how COVID-19 spread in communities have influenced case rates in prisons.\nCOVID-19 has highlighted the relationship between incarceration and health, but prior work has not explored how COVID-19 spread in communities have influenced case rates in prisons. Our objective was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 case rates in the general population and prisons located in the same county.\nFrom June-August 2020, NC ordered 29,605 tests from prisons and detected 1,639 cases. The mean case rates were 215 and 427 per 100,000 in the general and incarcerated population, respectively. Once counties reached substantial COVID-19 spread, the COVID-19 prison case rate increased by 118.55 cases per 100,000 (95% CI: -3.71, 240.81).\nFurther, COVID-19 spread in carceral facilities may reproduce and exacerbate health inequities in the general population. Black and Hispanic people are much more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are white [5], and are also much more likely to be incarcerated due to systemic racism with one in three Black men and one in six Latino men born in 2001 going to jail or prison at some point in their lifetime as opposed to one in seventeen white men [6]. Incarceration, systemic racism, and COVID-19 therefore may operate as syndemics that mutually exacerbate one another and drive inequities [7].\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 in Prisons and Jails\nContent:\nWith more than half a million infections behind bars and over 3,000 deaths, America’s response to COVID-19 in prisons and jails was a failure.

Lessons for the next pandemic, reviews of state efforts to address COVID, how mass incarceration made the pandemic worse outside of the prison walls, and more.\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, it was clear, the most effective way to mitigate the devastation of COVID-19 in prisons and jails is to reduce the number of people behind bars. The United States locks up a larger portion of its population than any other nation in the world. While it is true that the incarcerated population is lower than it was at the beginning of the pandemic, it is still far too high and trending back up.

The findings were published online in a research letter July 8 in JAMA.

This claim is consistent with the findings presented in Information 1 and Information 4, both of which were published on or before the claim.
