The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’\" But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here).

Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body’s ability to fight infection.” · It is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body’s immune system.

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

The World Health Organization recommends mothers continue breastfeeding even if they have COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, proposes the use of Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not accurate. According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather. The article explains that while the threat from hand sanitizer exploding might be overstated, there is still a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 24, 2020, from an article on WFTV, shares a statement from a fire expert who explains that a car's internal temperature would need to reach 572 degrees to cause hand sanitizer to explode. The expert also recommends keeping hand sanitizer with you and allowing it to dry for about a minute after applying it.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 2, 2020, from an article on USA TODAY, states that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable but can only ignite if a flame is introduced. Experts say that although leaving small amounts of ABHS in your car does not pose a significant fire risk, it should not be kept in vehicles because high temperatures can lower its disinfectant ability.\n\nClaim Accuracy:\n\nConsidering the information provided, the claim that a car blew up in Belém, Brazil, because the driver cleaned his key with alcohol-based hand sanitizer is likely false. The information presented in the sources indicates that while alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable, it requires a flame source to ignite, and the possibility of it exploding in a car due to heat or sunlight is minimal. Additionally, none of the sources mention any incidents of cars exploding due to hand sanitizer use.", "response": "FALSE."}

I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future.

Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles.

Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.

These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1].

There were possibilities of local transmission since most of the cases were reported in densely populated urban areas. We described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in Mombasa County.\nWe sought to attain an early understanding of key County specific epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Mombasa County to guide in the formulation and deployment of targeted public health containment measures to minimize morbidity, loss of life and disruption of society.\nAs of April 30, 2020, a total of 2,835 COVID -19 tests had been conducted in Mombasa County Table 1. Laboratory test results for 126 cases were positive giving a positivity rate of 4.4%. Males accounted for 1,655 (58.4%) while 1,177(41.5%) were female with a variant sex proportion among all sub counties.\n\nInformation 1 provides context about the COVID-19 situation in Kenya, mentioning that measures were implemented to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that the number of cases continued to grow despite these measures. Information 2 contains more specific details about the number of cases in Kenya as of a certain date, with Mombasa having 14 new cases. Information 4 gives a more general overview of the COVID-19 situation in Kenya, including the number of cases in Mombasa County. Information 5 focuses specifically on Mombasa County and provides detailed information about the number of cases and demographics of those affected.\n\nThe claim states that 23 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Mombasa on March 24, 2020. This is consistent with the information in Information 2, which states that Mombasa reported 14 new cases on that date. The other information provided does not give specific daily numbers for Mombasa, but given that the claim is within the timeframe of the provided information and is consistent with Information 2, it is likely accurate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely true.", "response": "FALSE."}

In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection.

However, the underlying mechanisms of masks in preventing virus transmission have not been well identified and the current experimental data still show inconsistent outcomes that may mislead the public.\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms of masks in preventing virus transmission have not been well identified and the current experimental data still show inconsistent outcomes that may mislead the public. For instance, the early understanding of the mask functions was limited especially in the escalating phase of the COVID 19 pandemic, resulting in quite controversial remarks on masks.\nThis review provides the most up‐to‐date information on the transmission modes of COVID‐19 virus in terms of droplets and aerosols. The roles of masks in disease prevention and transmission reduction are evaluated on various types, structures and functions. More important, both aspects of exhalation isolation and inhalation protection are discussed based on virus transmission modes and the effectiveness of different types of masks under varied environmental conditions. ... Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), the world has seen waves of coronavirus that have devastated many regions and countries.\nOne major disagreement lied on the necessary requirement of mask wearing in the public places especially for those who are not infected with COVID‐19. For example, Hong Kong recommended mask wearing for all in order to prevent respiratory viruses, while Germany claimed no evidences that the masks could significantly reduce infection risks for healthy people (Feng et al., 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Drinking alcohol does not prevent or treat coronavirus infection ...\nContent:\nIn fact, individuals who misuse alcohol chronically are more likely to develop ARDS, more likely to need mechanical ventilation, have a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit, and have a higher risk of mortality from ARDS.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.

County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. The provisional data presented on this page include the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; by week ending date, month, and year, and specific jurisdictions.\nDeath counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. Information 5 is from the National Center for Health Statistics and provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 in the US.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that the total number of deaths in the US in 2020 is significantly down compared to previous years is false. In fact, the opposite is true. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a large increase in total US deaths in 2020, with deaths still up 19.7% in 2021 compared to 2019. The claim appears to be an attempt to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in the US.", "response": "FALSE."}

While Beshear expressed support for barring fans from attending the race, per The New York Times, he did not order that measure himself. Churchill Downs, the venue for the Derby, ultimately made the decision to not have spectators in the stands due to increases in coronavirus cases in Louisville, per an August press release from the venue.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-09-10, states that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat who won over incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin in the state's 2019 election, supported the decision to hold the 2020 Kentucky Derby without on-site spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two Rare Neurologic Conditions Linked to COVID-19\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Earlier this year, scientists in various countries started examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19. The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.) Some media-watchers argued that Trump was deliberately distracting attention from weightier matters—including the firing of the State Department inspector general—and that the media shouldn’t let him. Others disagreed. ICYMI: Ronan Farrow, Ben Smith, and the problem of the superstar journalist · To understand Trump’s obsession with hydroxychloroquine, we need to back up a bit. Earlier this year, scientists in various countries started examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.\nOn Monday, President Trump casually told reporters that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he has repeatedly touted as effective against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The reporters seemed stunned. “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” Trump told them. The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.

Indigenous nations' own codes and policies can be instituted to bolster this response, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US (Hiraldo et al., 2021).\nIn Australia, there are early indications of establishing regional data infrastructure so Indigenous nations can use data for development (National Agreement on Closing the Gap, 2020). One policy proposal to assist in the current COVID-19 environment for Indigenous communities to respond to COVID-19 is to invest in technological solutions such as a syndromic surveillance system for Indigenous community-controlled/based data systems where there are options to do so, and appropriate Indigenous data governance can be applied.\nData sharing involves both the release of tribal information as well as the sharing of tribal information that other governments hold, such as COVID-19 related data, with tribes. A number of states and the federal government have denied tribal rights to access data for decision-making (Tahir and Cancryn, 2020). There is a recognized need for other governments and organizations to establish data sharing agreements and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples (Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Indigenous Data Working Group, 2020; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).\nThe United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2020); World Health Organization (2020), and the Pan American Health Organization (del Pino and Camacho, 2020) call for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data (direct and indirect) and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples. In the US, there has been a call for the availability of data disaggregated by Indigenous nations and tribal affiliation themselves, with the caveat that this must be done within the context of Indigenous governance of those data, including data sharing agreements (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous Communities in Canada | The Health ...\nContent:\nPurpose: The purpose of this literature review was to explore the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities.

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive. This indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\nThis indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets. However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%. Also read: What You Need to Know Before Trying to Make Sense of Sero-Survey Results · However, the researchers cautioned that four of the 15 districts in the survey (and out of 233 such districts in India, per the paper) with ‘zero cases’ didn’t have COVID-19 testing laboratories at the district headquarters and that samples collected in the area for tests had to be transported to state-headquarter hospitals.\n“The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas,” the researchers conclude. On July 10, PTI had reported that ICMR would conduct “a nationwide seroprevalence survey to determine the exposure of the novel coronavirus among the population … as a follow-up” to the one conducted in May-June.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is the official website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.\n\nInformation 2 is about a study conducted by ICMR that found that Indian food habits and ingredients, such as idli, rajma, zinc, fiber, and catechins present in tea, may have played an important role in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India. The study compared transcriptome profiles of COVID-19 patients from south India (Karnataka) and north India (Haryana) with those of Western populations.\n\nInformation 3 is about the importance of data sharing and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous nations' own codes and policies, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US. The information also highlights the need for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples.\n\nInformation 4 is a literature review of the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. The review found that many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. However, Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nInformation 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey. The survey found that 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive, indicating that India's COVID-19 epidemic had spread to rural parts despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\n\nClaim: As per ICMR study there’s been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. Information 2 is an ICMR study that focused on the role of food habits and ingredients in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them. Information 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them.

International offers of aid are multiplying.\nBy Claire Klobucista, Author and Sabine Baumgartner, Photo Editor ... No country has experienced as devastating a wave of COVID-19 infections as India is now. It set a new record for single-day infections last week, overtaking the United States, and it accounts for almost half of new cases worldwide. Experts say a combination of factors gave rise to the explosion in cases: new variants of the virus, including one first detected in India, that are thought to be more transmissible; a weak government response; and large public gatherings.\nThe average deaths per day are nearing 2,500, and the number continues to climb, pushing cremation facilities and cemeteries past their limits. Overall, the Indian government has reported around 195,000 deaths from COVID-19, but analysts say the total is likely much greater.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Edge of crisis: When kids suffer from COVID-19 - Down To Earth\nContent:\nWith children reporting severe post-COVID-19 symptoms, India must prioritise its paediatric infrastructure ...

Even after four days of care, the fever persisted and the family from Surat, Gujarat, took the infant to his paediatrician. Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors. It usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from COVID-19, suggest the “Guidelines on Operationalization of COVID Care Services for Children & Adolescents”, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in June 2021.\nWhile the proportion of children getting infected by COVID-19 is still not frightening, it is significant enough to establish that children are not as immune to post-COVID-19 complications as thought. Even the sketchy government numbers suggest a steady increase in the share of children in India’s total active COVID-19 cases, which includes patients still infectious.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How India is dealing with COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nIndia, which has the second-largest population in the world is suffering severely from COVID-19 disease. By May 18th, India investigated ∼1 lakh (0.1million) infected cases from COVID-19, and as of 11th July the cases equalled 8 lakhs. Social distancing and lockdown rules were employed in India, which however had an additional impact on the economy, human living, and environment.\nCOVID-19 outbreak is the sixth PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola (2014 in West Africa), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo) [3]. India which is the second-largest population in the world having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on18th May 2020, and as of 11th of July crossed 8.5 lakhs.\nCOVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time. For 2020, the tourism industry and air travel are expected to suffer greatly, and India's GDP growth is expected to decline ∼2.5% from 5.3%.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impacts of India's second COVID-19 wave on children | Coronavirus ...\nContent:\nWith schools closed, parents unable to work and many caregivers who are ill or hospitalised, the second wave of COVID-19 in India is leaving devastating impacts on the emotional and physical well-being of children.

Godinho's photo was posted to Facebook and wrongly captioned as the face of Abdulwahab: This post from Facebook even says in the bottom corner that it's not Abdulwahab but Godinho. Yet, the same misattribution remains in Facebook groups, spreading false information: Clearly, all the boys are entirely different people, but only Abdulwahab and Godinho are connected to the coronavirus outbreak, which has reached over 1 million cases worldwide as of April 6, 2020.\nIs the photo accompanying a story about the death of a 13-year-old English boy actually the right person? No, that's not true. A biographcal piece on Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died on March 30, 2020, from COVID-19, features the photo of Conor Wilmot, a 13-year-old Irish boy who died in 2017 from an internet self-harm challenge.\nThe incorrectly captioned image was embedded at the top of both articles, by wikitrusted.com and wikifoxnews.com. The inclusion of a photo of Conor Wilmot who died in 2017, in the biography of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died in 2020 of COVID-19 has added a false crisis-actor narrative to the growing number of online conspiracies about the novel coronavirus.\nA biographcal piece on Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died on March 30, 2020, from COVID-19, features the photo of Conor Wilmot, a 13-year-old Irish boy who died in 2017 from an internet self-harm challenge.

Record, a Portuguese newspaper, first wrote about Godinho’s passing on March 29. Other media outlets quickly followed suit, publishing stories about Godinho’s death alongside images of the child, including the photo used in the social media posts.\nThe post reads, “CHILD DIES IN 3 COUNTRIES OF CORONA VIRUS.” Similar claims involving the same child’s photo have also appeared on Twitter. The content of the post, which has been widely shared across social media, is misleading on several points. The child pictured in the post is Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a Portuguese boy who died at age 14 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.\nRather, Godinho’s photo was included in the story in reference to other young people who had died of COVID-19 in Europe, and it accurately identifies the photo as that of Godinho. Prior to the passing of the unnamed Belgian girl, Godinho was believed to be “Europe’s youngest coronavirus victim.” There are no pictures of the Belgian girl in the Daily Express article or any other article we were able to find. The social media post also claims that Godinho’s image is being used in the news report of a 13-year-old boy in the UK, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died from the coronavirus.\nSocial media posts falsely suggest that news outlets are misusing a boy’s image to report the same child died of COVID-19 in three different countries.

Seeing as the sex workers in Uganda are popularly found at border points where they interact with truck drivers [2,3] they were a key target in reducing community spread. In response, the Ministry of Health employed a self-proclaimed sex worker and Kampala city socialite to cast a commercial break advertisement as a health promotion measure.\nShe warned girls at the Ugandan borders to avoid truck drivers to keep the nation free of COVID-19 [4]. This move went beyond the discrimination that sex workers in Uganda face to show the importance of such a marginalized group in the community spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.\nPan African Medical Journal (ISSN: 1937-8688).

The information provided includes various reports and articles that discuss the impact of Covid-19 on sex workers in Uganda and other African countries. Specifically, the information highlights the challenges faced by sex workers in accessing healthcare services, including ARVs and contraceptives, due to lockdown measures and police crackdowns. The Uganda Key Populations Consortium (UKPC) reported raids, extortion, and alleged attacks by the police, including 117 arrests of sex workers in two weeks. The information also highlights the stigma and discrimination faced by sex workers during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim is true, as the information provided does not suggest that Uganda suspended sex during the Covid-19 crisis. Instead, the information highlights the challenges faced by sex workers in accessing healthcare services and the discrimination and stigma they faced during the crisis. The claim accurately states that Uganda did not suspend sex during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe information provided supports the claim by highlighting the challenges faced by sex workers in Uganda during the Covid-19 crisis, including police crackdowns and the closure of bars and nightclubs. However, the information does not suggest that Uganda suspended sex during the crisis. Therefore, the claim is true based on the available information and the definition of suspending sex, which implies a government or official ban on sexual activity.", "response": "FALSE."}

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)).

The HCS panel is a benchmark for serology studies in this Article and previous publications1,2,3. a, Concentrations (in arbitrary units) of IgG that binds recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (lower limit of detection (LLOD) = 1.72 U ml−1). b, SARS-CoV-2 50% virus-neutralization titres (VNT50) (LLOD = 20). c, d, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on days 0, 14, 28 and 42 after first injection of BNT162b2 were restimulated ex vivo with full-length S peptide mix.\nThe histopathology of necropsy specimens obtained 7–8 days after challenge revealed localized areas of pulmonary inflammation that were limited in extent even in the control macaques challenged after mock immunization with saline (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.\nWe conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.

Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020).

The video also claims that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. Both of these claims are Not Legit. Here’s how we fact-checked it. With any fact check, a good place to start is to take a look at who is sharing the information.\nNow for the claim Rebel News makes that the vaccine comes with a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. The Food and Drug Administration approves all vaccines that are administered, so FDA documents are a really good place to find official stats.

According to the document, during the trials, two out of 21,000 trial participants who got the vaccine died. One of those two people died from a heart attack while the other died from arteriosclerosis.\nAccording to the document, during the trials, two out of 21,000 trial participants who got the vaccine died.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

Methods: We conducted a literature search and identified 232 articles; we included 90 after screening. We pulled information from each article using standardized questions for “type of study,” “population,” “specific vaccine,” “reasons for hesitancy,” “hesitancy prevalence,” “attempt at change,” “results of intervention,” and “future interventions.” We created recurrent themes from the data and analyzed these themes via descriptive statistics.\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do give guidance on general approaches to these conversations, keeping up with hard data and multiple studies on various vaccinations can be tedious and is not realistic for many doctors.8,9 · The theme of not enough information is highlighted by more research being cited as the most commonly proposed future intervention.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents.

Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

Around 40,000 people, including Tablighi Jamaat attendees and their contacts, were quarantined across the country.\nSenior BJP leaders like Shivraj Singh Chouhan attributed Tablighi Jamaat congregation for a spike in cases of COVID-19 in the country, a claim which was disputed by experts from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College in Indore saying that they have no data to link the spread of the pandemic to the congregation.

Information 1 and 2, published on 2020-04-03, state that Tablighi Jamaat members in Ghaziabad have misbehaved with female nursing staff and will be booked under the NSA. Information 4, published on 2020-04-04, quotes U.P.

The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade.

The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.
