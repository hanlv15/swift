Forged in opposition — first to the military regime, then to a series of democratically elected governments — the PT has held the Brazilian presidency since 2003, first under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and now under Dilma Rousseff.\nIndicators of change include ideological moderation, reform of internal decision-making structures, new relationships with civil society organisations, the willingness to ally with centre and right-wing parties, construction of a new electoral base among Brazil’s poor majority, and overall a general reorientation of the party’s public image. This panel takes stock of the changes within the PT since the first presidential victory in 2002. Papers cover the PT’s shifting electoral base, its reformed internal organisation, and its evolving relationship to Brazilian civil society.\nEuropean Consortium for Political Research\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-04-05\nTitle: Brazil's Workers Party guarantees open dialogue with businessmen ...\nContent:\nA dinner between Brazil's Workers Party (PT) leader Gleisi Hoffmann and 30 businessmen on Monday ended with two pieces of information well-received by the latter: The party will work with central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto and there is no thought of controlling fuel prices if former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wins the October election.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil’s once-mighty Workers’ party faces reckoning\nContent:\nEx-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s promises of <strong>a</strong> <strong>PT</strong> comeback in 2022 are met with scepticism\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-30, is a fact-check by Agência Lupa denying the existence of a message from Gleisi Hoffmann asking PT affiliates to boycott the COVID-19 emergency allowance.

Considering the sequential relationship between the claim and Information 1, the claim is false.\n\nMoreover, Information 3 and Information 5 further support the conclusion that the claim is false. These sources show that the PT has been moderating its ideology and forming alliances with centre and right-wing parties, which contradicts the claim's assertion that the PT would reject government aid and denounce it as a fascist government.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the sequential relationship between the claim and Information 1, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection. The fake poster was manipulated from the original WHO poster, which advises people to \"avoid unprotected contact with live wild or farm animals.\" The fake poster has been spread on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. The real WHO poster was published on January 27, 2020, and recommends several measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection, including washing hands frequently, covering nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough, cooking meat and eggs thoroughly, and avoiding unprotected contact with live wild or farm animals. The WHO has clarified that the text about unprotected sex with animals is fake and digitally altered. Information 5 discusses the evolution of infectious agents in relation to sex in animals, but it does not provide any information about the WHO's advice on coronavirus prevention.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that WHO has advised against unprotected sex with animals to prevent coronavirus infection is false. The WHO has not advised against unprotected sex with animals, and the fake poster was manipulated from the original WHO poster. The original WHO poster advises people to avoid unprotected contact with live wild or farm animals, and it was published on January 27, 2020. The claim was published on February 3, 2020, after the original WHO poster was published, so the claim is false based on the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here).

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020). Human activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).\nHuman activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).

However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %).

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

Keeping it in your car during hot weather, exposing it to sun causing magnification of light through the bottle,” WLFD wrote.\nOn May 22, NFPA published another video to debunk alcohol-based hand sanitizer car fire claims. “Despite some information currently being released on social media and in the news, the short answer is no,” Verzoni wrote. “From a fire safety standpoint, it is not unsafe to leave hand sanitizer inside a hot vehicle.”\nGreg Boyce, Florida Gulf Coast University department of chemistry and physics associate professor, said hand sanitizer should not be kept in a car for more than a few hours during a March 26 interview with ABC. “If you are running errands and want to keep it in the car, that’s fine,” Boyce said. “But you shouldn’t be leaving it in the car indefinitely.” · Cathy Pagendarm, Quanta Services Inc. and WLFD have not responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment. We rate the claim that alcohol-based hand sanitizer stored in hot cars can ignite FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 22, 2020, from an article on Car and Driver, discusses a warning issued by the fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, about the potential for alcohol-based hand sanitizer bottles to explode in cars. The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather. The article explains that while the threat from hand sanitizer exploding might be overstated, there is still a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 24, 2020, from an article on WFTV, shares a statement from a fire expert who explains that a car's internal temperature would need to reach 572 degrees to cause hand sanitizer to explode. The expert also recommends keeping hand sanitizer with you and allowing it to dry for about a minute after applying it.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 2, 2020, from an article on USA TODAY, states that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable but can only ignite if a flame is introduced. Experts say that although leaving small amounts of ABHS in your car does not pose a significant fire risk, it should not be kept in vehicles because high temperatures can lower its disinfectant ability.\n\nClaim Accuracy:\n\nConsidering the information provided, the claim that a car blew up in Belém, Brazil, because the driver cleaned his key with alcohol-based hand sanitizer is likely false. The information presented in the sources indicates that while alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable, it requires a flame source to ignite, and the possibility of it exploding in a car due to heat or sunlight is minimal.

Under these circumstances, effective vaccines play a critical role in saving lives, improving population health, and facilitating economic recovery. In Muslim-majority countries, Islamic jurisprudence, which places great importance on sanctity and safety of human life and protection of livelihoods, may influence vaccine uptake.\nHowever, concerns about vaccine products’ Halal (permissible to consume by Islamic law) status and potential harm can inhibit acceptance. Fatwa councils agree that vaccines are necessary in the context of our current pandemic; receiving a COVID-19 vaccination is actually a form of compliance with Sharia law.\nFatwa councils agree that vaccines are necessary in the context of our current pandemic; receiving a COVID-19 vaccination is actually a form of compliance with Sharia law. Broader use of animal component free reagents during manufacturing may further increase acceptance among Muslims. We herein explain the interplay between Sharia (Islamic law) and scientific considerations in addressing the challenge of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, particularly in Muslim populations.\nA coordinated global response led to development of COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Major vaccination efforts are now ongoing throughout the world (1). Unfortunately, uptake has been hindered for several reasons, including religious beliefs (2). This article will provide an Islamic perspective on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-01-06, is a fact-check by Newtral.es denying the claim that the Spanish Islamic community has declared they will not vaccinate against COVID-19. The Islamic Commission of Spain has recommended following the recommendations of health authorities.\n\nInformation 2 is a study discussing vaccine hesitancy within the Muslim community, particularly in Arab countries and during Ramadan. It highlights the role of education, income levels, and conspiracy theories in vaccine hesitancy. The information does not mention the Spanish Islamic community specifically.\n\nInformation 3 discusses Spain's vaccination efforts, including support from scientific societies and the challenges of meeting the needs of marginalized populations. It also mentions the confusion generated by combining different COVID-19 vaccines and the public's difficulty distinguishing reliable information due to the infodemic.\n\nInformation 4 discusses Egypt and the United Arab Emirates' religious authorities ruling COVID-19 vaccines permissible under Islamic law, even if they contain pig derivatives. It emphasizes the importance of vaccination for the public good of Muslims.\n\nInformation 5 is an article discussing Sharia (Islamic law) perspectives on COVID-19 vaccines, stating that fatwa councils agree vaccines are necessary and receiving a COVID-19 vaccination is a form of compliance with Sharia law. It also highlights the potential impact of using animal component-free reagents during manufacturing to increase acceptance among Muslims.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published on 2021-01-06, states that the Spanish Islamic community has declared they will not vaccinate against COVID-19. However, Information 1, published on the same date, is a fact-check denying this claim and stating that the Islamic Commission of Spain has recommended following the recommendations of health authorities.
