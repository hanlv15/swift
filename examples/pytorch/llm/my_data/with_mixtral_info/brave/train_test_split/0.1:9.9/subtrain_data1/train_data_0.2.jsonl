As per a report by 'Associated Press' from last year, Obama's spokeswoman Katie Hill confirmed that \"Obama did not say this and regardless he is pro-vaccination\".

The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade. To be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded. A second wartime aid program, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was founded in November 1943, by 44 Allied governments, for the purpose of assisting and resettling displaced victims of the war.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-07-08, discusses the Portuguese government's inability to provide guidance to local authorities regarding the sharing of personal data of protesters by Lisbon City Council.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here). However, milk does not contain a significant amount of vitamin C or zinc. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lists foods and their nutrients in a database.\nThe British Nutrition Foundation states here , “No food or supplement, can protect you from getting the coronavirus (COVID-19). Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body’s ability to fight infection.” · It is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body’s immune system. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “vitamin C improves the absorption of iron from plant-based foods and helps the immune system work properly to protect the body from disease” (here).\nMark Pochapin (here), a gastroenterologist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, said he did not think there was “really any significant health benefit to lactoferrin.” Like the CDC and the WHO, Dr. Pochapin advised that people “just be meticulous” about washing their hands, avoid touching their face, and keep social distancing. ...

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19. Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as effective against COVID-19, despite there being no conclusive proof.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, without specified publication dates, mention that President Trump said he consulted with the White House doctor before taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-05-21, states that President Trump told reporters he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, the unproven drug he had touted for COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-04-24, earlier than the provided information. The claim states that Trump spoke with the President of Honduras, who mentioned the incredible results of using hydroxychloroquine in Honduras. Since the claim's publication date is earlier than the provided information, the focus should be on whether Trump had any interactions with hydroxychloroquine or discussions about its effectiveness before the claim's publication date.\n\nBased on the available information, there is no direct evidence to confirm or deny the claim that Trump discussed hydroxychloroquine with the President of Honduras before 2020-04-24. However, considering Trump's subsequent promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure and his touting of its effectiveness, it is plausible that Trump might have had early conversations about hydroxychloroquine with other world leaders. Without concrete evidence, it is impossible to definitively classify the claim as true or false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ...

The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.\nDeaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020).
