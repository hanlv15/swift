The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

Likewise, this post appears to do the same by stating that the death toll from Covid-19 is actually much lower in reality than is being indicated by official figures.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-08-28\nTitle: FALSE: The COVID-19 death tolls in Ireland, England and Italy have ...\nContent:\nExplanation: It is untrue to claim that <strong>the</strong> <strong>death</strong> <strong>tolls</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>England</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Italy</strong> <strong>from</strong> <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>have</strong> <strong>been</strong> <strong>miscalculated</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>inflated</strong> Read the Full Article (TheJournal.ie)\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights: Deaths\nContent:\nThe first reported care home death involving COVID-19 was reported in week 12, 2020 for England and Scotland, and week 13 for Wales and Northern Ireland. In all countries, there were sharp increases at the beginning of the pandemic, and again in late 2020 and early 2021. Scotland and Northern Ireland registered their highest proportion of weekly deaths in care homes involving COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic (week 18 2020: Scotland 49.4%; Northern Ireland 50.0%). England registered their highest proportion in early 2021 (week 4 2021, 48.9%), as did Wales (week 3 2021, 58.4%).\nThe Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) weekly provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland includes all deaths with coronavirus (COVID-19) mentioned on the death certificate. Figures presented on the latest insights tool are different from the daily surveillance figures on COVID-19 deaths published by the Department of Health and Social Care, which provide daily and cumulative deaths occurring within 28 days of a positive test.\nThere were 619 deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK in the latest week (ending 17 March 2023). This is a rise from 605 in the previous week. Of these, 512 were registered in England, 47 in Wales, 56 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland. A total of 13,683 deaths were registered in the UK in the week ending 17 March 2023, which was 9.3% above the five-year average. In the same week, deaths involving COVID-19 accounted for 4.5% of all deaths in the UK, compared with 4.6% in the previous week.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality - statistics - Statistics Explained\nContent:\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of the EU; however, its impact was not evenly spread. The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nData from Ireland were not included in the first phase of the excess mortality release: official timely data were not available because deaths in Ireland can be registered up to three months after the date of death. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data. At the end of April 2021, the CSO started publishing a time series from October 2019 until the most recent weeks, using death notices (see the CSO website).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer\nContent:\nDaily and weekly updated statistics tracking the number of <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> cases, recovered, <strong>and</strong> <strong>deaths</strong>. Historical data with cumulative charts, graphs, and updates.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 are from the same publication, TheJournal.ie, and are published on 2020-08-28. They both debunk the claim that COVID-19 death tolls in Ireland, England, and Italy have been miscalculated and inflated. The information points out that the claim was made on Facebook without any source and is false. Italy did not miscalculate their death toll by 90%, and the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar did not confirm that Ireland's statistics are inflated. England did lower their official count by some 5,000, but that was due to a change in its classification of deaths related to the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3 is from a publication in 2023-03-27, which provides the latest insights on COVID-19 deaths in the UK. It includes the number of deaths involving COVID-19 registered in the UK in the latest week and presents a total of 13,683 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 17 March 2023, which was 9.3% above the five-year average.\n\nInformation 4 provides excess mortality statistics in the EU during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %), and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %), and France (36.4 %). However, the information does not mention any miscalculation or inflation of the death tolls.\n\nInformation 5 is from Worldometer, providing daily and weekly updated statistics tracking the number of COVID-19 cases, recovered, and deaths. Historical data with cumulative charts, graphs, and updates are also available.\n\nClaim Verdict:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that COVID-19 death tolls in Ireland, England, and Italy have been miscalculated and inflated is false. The claim was debunked by TheJournal.ie on 2020-08-28, and there is no evidence or information supporting the claim from other reliable sources. Additionally, Information 4 provides excess mortality statistics in the EU during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it does not mention any miscalculation or inflation of the death tolls.", "response": "FALSE."}
