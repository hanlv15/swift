A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain.\nResearchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest.\nSome people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future.

Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients.

Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)). Human convalescent sera (HCS) were obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 d after PCR-confirmed diagnosis and at a time when acute COVID-19 symptoms had resolved (n = 38). The HCS panel is a benchmark for serology studies in this Article and previous publications1,2,3. a, Concentrations (in arbitrary units) of IgG that binds recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (lower limit of detection (LLOD) = 1.72 U ml−1). b, SARS-CoV-2 50% virus-neutralization titres (VNT50) (LLOD = 20). c, d, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on days 0, 14, 28 and 42 after first injection of BNT162b2 were restimulated ex vivo with full-length S peptide mix.\nThe histopathology of necropsy specimens obtained 7–8 days after challenge revealed localized areas of pulmonary inflammation that were limited in extent even in the control macaques challenged after mock immunization with saline (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.\nWe conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccines BNT162b1 or BNT162b2—lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode secreted, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or prefusion-stabilized S, respectively—induce strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice and macaques.\nTherefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19 vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses. Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

The article confirms that the video is from Thailand, not China, and was taken on April 4, 2020.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, provides additional details about the video, explaining that it shows a frog vendor in rural Thailand selling live frogs as a snack from the back of a pick-up truck.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 14, 2020, is a YouTube video title mentioning a video of live frog selling in China after the lockdown. However, the content of the video is not provided, and it does not explicitly claim the video is from China.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 7, 2020, is a fact-check article by AFP debunking a false claim that three videos, unrelated to the frog video, have been viewed tens of thousands of times.\n\nInformation 5, published on August 16, 2016, is an article about Señor Frog's closing in Times Square, which is unrelated to the frog video.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is:\n\nCLAIM:\nPublication date: 2020-05-18\nContent: A video showing hundreds of frogs being sold from the back of a truck has been viewed tens of thousands of times in multiple posts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube alongside a claim that it was taken in China after the country lifted its coronavirus lockdown.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim states that the video was taken in China after the coronavirus lockdown. However, the fact-check article (Information 1) and the original source of the video (Information 2) both confirm that the video is from Thailand, not China. The video was taken on April 4, 2020, which is before the claim was published on May 18, 2020. Therefore, the claim is incorrect regarding the location, and it is unclear if the claim was made before or after the video was published online.\n\nClassification: FALSE", "response": "FALSE."}

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two Rare Neurologic Conditions Linked to COVID-19\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

In both cases, physicians made the diagnoses based on abnormal eye examinations. The two patients responded to treatment and improved over 2 weeks, with only the 50-year-old featuring residual symptoms of anosmia and ageusia. The report was published online April 17 in Neurology.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Neurological Complications of COVID-19: A Review of the Literature ...\nContent:\nA more severe and rare neuropsychiatric complication of COVID-19 that has been documented is catatonia, and only a few publications have reported this [64-65]. The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Neurological symptoms are among the larger array of symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) infection, which includes Long COVID. Long COVID affects different people in different ways-- studies have reported up to 200 symptoms associated with Long COVID, and individuals with the condition experience clusters of symptoms.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, discusses the neurological impact of COVID-19 and various conditions linked to the virus. The text explains that the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily due to the body's immune response rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. Additionally, it highlights the increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 for people with neurological disorders.\n\nInformation 2, published by Medscape on April 29, 2020, focuses on two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19: a 50-year-old man who developed Miller Fisher syndrome and a 39-year-old man who developed polyneuritis cranialis. Both are variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The two patients responded to treatment and improved over 2 weeks, with only the 50-year-old having residual symptoms of anosmia and ageusia.\n\nInformation 3, although the publication date is not specified, provides a comprehensive review of the neurological complications of COVID-19.

We will also continue to engage with Note Circulation Scheme members and ATM operators to get an up-to-date view on customer demand for banknotes. We will continue to hold interviews with a range of large retailers to learn more about their cash holdings, the cash trends they are seeing and their attitudes to cash acceptance.\n2022 also saw travel disruptions, often due to staff shortages in the travel industry, which may be discouraging people from taking holidays overseas. Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

The posts show even convincing screenshots and allude to statements made by both companies indicating they have been developing technologies to help aid in contact tracing efforts; this evidence is served up as proof the mega-corps are hiding apps on your phones and tracking everywhere you go.\nNow, look, it’s true some early contact tracing apps carried out shady data-collection schemes, and there have been concerns over “contact-tracing arrests” during recent protests. But the rumors about back-door tracing features being installed surreptitiously on your devices just aren’t true.\nAt this point, the only way for a contact-tracing app to show up on your phone is for you to manually download and install it and grant it permission to track your data.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free.

The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The plan is backed by many U.S. allies, including Germany, Japan and the European Commission and appealed to some members of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. However, Trump has criticized the WHO for what he calls its “China-centric” response to the pandemic, so the U.S. won’t partner with the organization.\nWhen countries opt out, that makes it more difficult to meet the goals of lower vaccine costs, better health outcomes and fewer COVID-19 deaths, the newspaper reported.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here).

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

The child pictured in the post is Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a Portuguese boy who died at age 14 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.\nRather, Godinho’s photo was included in the story in reference to other young people who had died of COVID-19 in Europe, and it accurately identifies the photo as that of Godinho. Prior to the passing of the unnamed Belgian girl, Godinho was believed to be “Europe’s youngest coronavirus victim.” There are no pictures of the Belgian girl in the Daily Express article or any other article we were able to find. The social media post also claims that Godinho’s image is being used in the news report of a 13-year-old boy in the UK, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died from the coronavirus.\nSocial media posts falsely suggest that news outlets are misusing a boy’s image to report the same child died of COVID-19 in three different countries. The posts actually refer to three different young people who died from the novel coronavirus in Portugal, Belgium and the UK.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: PolitiFact | Doctored images in coronavirus post exploit boy’s ...\nContent:\nen.as.com, \"Coronavirus: 13-year-old boy dies of coronavirus in the UK,\" April 1, 2020 · AFP Fact Check, \"This photo has circulated in reports about an Irish teenager who died in 2017,\" April 8, 2020 · Lead Stories, \"Fact Check: Photo On Biography Of Boy Who Died From Coronavirus Is NOT Actually Him,\" April 6, 2020\nStirring new grief for the family of a boy who committed suicide in 2017, people are sharing doctored images of the child in an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the coronavirus pandemic. \"Same little boy died of COVID-19 in three different countries,\" a Facebook post says facetiously. \"Still don’t believe the media is #fakenews?\" The post, which contains three screenshots of what appear to be portions of three different news reports, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
