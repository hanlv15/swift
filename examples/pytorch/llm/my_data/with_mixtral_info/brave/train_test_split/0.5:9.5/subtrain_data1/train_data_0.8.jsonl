Infectious <strong>disease</strong> expert Roy Chemaly, M.D., debunks some of the most common <strong>coronavirus</strong> myths.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-10-22\nTitle: What Temperature Kills Coronavirus (COVID-19)?\nContent:\nresearchers estimated that most coronaviruses would be almost completely killed after exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes. The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus. For temperatures above 65°C (149°F) is expected to cause near complete inactivation with exposures greater than 3 minutes. For temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that these findings agree with WHO guidelines which report a 4 log reduction of coronavirus for 56°C (133°F) with 15‐minute exposures 14 and is consistent with information for killing other infectious agents. 15\nHowever, for temperatures in the range 50‐55°C (122‐131°F) we recommend 20 minutes or longer of exposure. At these levels, we expect the viral concentration to be lowered by log 5‐7, near or below the detectable limit. Because of the seriousness of the current coronavirus infection, we suggest a reasonable safety factor can be obtained by increasing the above‐listed temperatures by 10°C (about 18 °F).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can just hot water kill the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?

The article states that most coronaviruses would be almost completely killed after exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes. The article also mentions that temperatures of 50 to 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes can also kill the virus.\n\nInformation 4, no publication date, is an article that provides a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that warm drinks, high ambient temperatures, and gargling warm water do not kill the virus. The claim that the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is also false, as the WHO states that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to several days.\n\nInformation 3, 4 and 5 also support the fact that the claim is false. Information 3 and 4 state that the virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more. Information 5 states that hot water alone cannot kill the virus on surfaces.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that warm drinks kill the coronavirus, the virus dies when the ambient temperature is higher than 26ºC, gargling warm water helps treat the disease and the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is false. The virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more.

Their cognitive frame suddenly shifts from their grandchildren’s soccer games and dreams of travel to measuring time in two-week cycles. Chemotherapy sessions, doctor’s appointments, scan suddenly define their time. Doing such, though, allows cancer to invade one’s very sense of self as it invades organ structure. Justice Ginsburg, though, demonstrated that cancer can be part of a person without being the whole person.\nHow good could her prognosis be?

One more huzzah should be added to the list: cancer survivor. Ginsburg was first diagnosed with colon cancer two decades ago, and over a period of more than 20 years beat it back. She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it. A decade later came a new diagnosis, pancreatic cancer, discovered early because the jurist was still undergoing regular screening because of her first cancer. In 2018, two tumors were surgically removed from her lungs, and then last year a new malignancy was discovered on her pancreas.\n\nInformation 1, published on September 23, 2020, confirms that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died due to metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Scientists at Oxford University, with experience in dealing with Ebola virus, Zika virus, and SARS virus also agree that the disease is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.\nUnlike bacteria, viruses need a living host to survive and cannot be treated with antibiotics. Health authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control have rejected claims that antibiotics can cure the disease because it is not caused by bacteria. The posts also make claims connecting coronavirus to 5G networks. AFP Fact Check has debunked that here. Italy's health ministry rejected claims that painkillers such as paracetamol and aspirin could cure COVID-19.\nItaly's health ministry rejected claims that painkillers such as paracetamol and aspirin could cure COVID-19. “(Paracetamol) provides pain relief, which is very useful in case of high fever, but it does not cure coronavirus,” it said on its webpage dedicated to debunking misinformation and disinformation around COVID-19. As of June 8, 2020, the Italian health ministry maintains that “there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\nFacebook posts shared thousands of times claim that the novel coronavirus disease is caused by bacteria and can be cured with household painkillers. The posts also claim that Italian doctors found a cure for COVID-19. Both claims are false; Italy's health ministry told AFP Fact Check that the posts were “a hoax”. No cure has been found for the disease.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2024-01-06\nTitle: COVID-19 misinformation - Wikipedia\nContent:\nIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Fox News adopted an editorial line that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted, and presenter Sean Hannity claimed on-air that the pandemic was a \"hoax\" (he later issued a denial). When evaluated by media analysts, the effect of broadcast misinformation has been found to influence health outcomes in the population. In a natural experiment (an experiment that takes place spontaneously, without human design or intervention), two similar television news programs that were shown on the Fox News network in February–March 2020 were compared.\nIn a hearing the next day, US senator Rand Paul alleged that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan, accusing researchers including epidemiologist Ralph Baric of creating \"super-viruses\". Both Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins have denied that the US government supported such research. Baric likewise rejected Paul's allegations, saying that his lab's research into the potential in bat coronaviruses for cross-species transmission was not deemed gain-of-function by NIH or the University of North Carolina, where he works.\nReza Malekzadeh, Iran's deputy health minister and former Minister of Health, rejected claims that the virus was a biological weapon, pointing out that the US would be suffering heavily from it. He said Iran was hard-hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus, and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza.\nReza Malekzadeh, Iran's deputy health minister, rejected bioterrorism theories. An Iranian cleric in Qom said Donald Trump targeted the city with coronavirus \"to damage its culture and honor\".

Based on these points alone, it seems a sauna can kill coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna can kill the novel coronavirus. The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17].

Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

The false claim was spread by gossip and parody accounts on Twitter before being picked up by a website operated by a company that accepts money from partisan groups and is run by a conservative talk show radio host whose co-host later repeated the claim on-air.

In this case, it’s seamless merging of fact and fantasy. All of the 19 CEOs in the meme have, in fact, stepped down from their posts. That’s not fake. But their departures had nothing to do with coronavirus, and many took place long before the first COVID-19 cluster was identified.\nAccording to Business Insider, the CEO of the tobacco company Altria, Howard Willard, resigned due to complications from contracting the illness; while the head of SeaWorld recently resigned due to the financial hit the park was taking from having to close down; and there are rumors that Disney head Bob Iger unexpectedly stepped down over a year before his planned retirement because he knew how bad the pandemic would be. And there’s another conspiracy that Q believers have ignored entirely—one that’s already been proven to have come true.\nSo yes, while more CEOs have resigned in the last few years than since the Great Recession, most were in the works long before the coronavirus pandemic hit. They had nothing to do with the actual pandemic—and not the behind-the-scenes war between good and evil that Q believers talk about. The real conspiracies—be it insider trading or that “man of the people” Donald Trump made a great number of rich people more wealthy who are now they are cashing out before things collapse—apparently just isn’t as fun.\nAnd we’re all too distracted by the torrent of pandemic headlines to realize what’s really going on here: Deep state-aligned industry titans are running for the hills before they’re brought down by President Donald Trump and his team of patriots. Supposedly. Check this out. No coincidences. All these CEO resignations within 48 hours…\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2018-01-25\nTitle: What CEO Resignations Reveal | Recent CEO Resignations\nContent:\nOn December 7, 2021, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker announced his resignation. Parker had served as an airline CEO for 20 years. The company’s president, Robert Isom, will take over on March 31. Parker will serve as Chairman of the carrier’s board. “It likely would have happened sooner, but the global pandemic — and the devastating impact it had on our industry — delayed those plans,” Parker stated in a note to his employees.\nOn January 20, 2021, Michael Pack, CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media including Voice of America resigned at President Biden’s request, two hours after being sworn in. Often accused for partisanship, Pack pointed fingers at journalists for anti-Trump bias. He initiated investigations into bias claims and tried to sack senior “deep state” executives.\nUnfortunately, many CEO’s are misaligned with corporate objectives. Some make poor or even fatal decisions under stress. Others allow their character flaws to spin out of control. Too many CEO’s sabotage their own best efforts and fail to bring their best selves to the workplace. They can experience untold embarrassment, despair, and untimely resignations.\nSilbermann shared “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see… Bill is a great leader for this transition.” · On June 22, 2022, Jose Mauro Coelho, the CEO of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras stepped down. His resignation occurred amidst political pressure from lawmakers and President Jair Bolsonaro due to rising fuel prices.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 are from the same source and provide details about a Facebook post made by Cody Harris on March 12, 2020. The post claimed that a series of CEO resignations before the novel coronavirus outbreak were linked to a global conspiracy. The post was debunked as false by fact-checkers, who pointed out that there was no evidence to support the claim and that many of the CEOs mentioned had not actually stepped down from their positions.\n\nInformation 3 is about a different claim, made in December 2021, that a series of high-level corporate resignations were linked to the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. This claim was also debunked as false by fact-checkers, who found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the claim made by Cody Harris. It explains that while some of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim were real, they had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or any global conspiracy. Instead, they were due to a variety of factors, including personal health issues and company financial problems.\n\nInformation 5 is not directly related to the claim made by Cody Harris, but it provides some general context about CEO resignations. It notes that some CEOs resign due to poor decision-making, character flaws, or political pressure.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim made by Cody Harris that CEO resignations are linked to a global conspiracy is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and many of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim have been debunked as false. Additionally, the fact that some CEOs resign for a variety of reasons unrelated to any conspiracy supports the conclusion that the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.

Research from the Imperial College London (ICL), in the United Kingdom, has predicted the likely effects on mortality of two different ways of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings, which are directly informing U.K. policy, suggest that in the U.K. and United States, a policy of suppressing the outbreak, rather than mitigating it, would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19: Mitigation or suppression? - PMC\nContent:\nNot only infectious disease experts, epidemiologists and ICU specialists are involved in this challenge, but also each individual in every community: Either as potential victim of COVID-19 or as an actual or potential care provider to infected persons in a bigger sense. Simply, the future of mankind is at stake! We are currently experiencing a unique situation in which science and scientists are getting all the attention of politicians, economists, clerics, media…etc. Scientists are in a race against time to combat a potentially fatal disease which healthcare systems even in the most developed world have to surrender to.\nPublished online 2020 Apr 21. doi: 10.1016/j.ajg.2020.04.010 ... Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology. Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nIt is quite evident that one of the reports which had great impact on decision making during the current crisis is the report of Neil Ferguson et al. on the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demands [1]. In their report, using a transmission model founded on an individual-based simulation model for pandemic influenza, the authors investigated the effects of 2 intervention strategies in a UK and a USA context: 1 – Mitigation strategy with the aim of slowing down transmission but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread (reproduction number R not necessarily <1) with protection of more vulnerable groups and reducing the peak healthcare demand, 2 – Suppression strategy in which epidemic spread is reversed to reproduction number (R) <1.\nIn the suppression group social distancing of all age groups, household quarantine and closing schools and universities are further interventions. In the mitigation strategy interventions have to be timely instituted (not too early) to give chance for herd immunity to develop.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Scientists say epidemic suppression is only viable option\nContent:\nIn the UK, this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK (previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated) and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity. “We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\nThe report by Imperial College’s COVID-19 Response Team - Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand – looked at two different strategies.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for ...\nContent:\nIn other words, we simulated a situation that from the second day of receiving confirmed case, only 5% of the overall population would be possible to contact the infectious ones. Then, the β2 = 0.05. The results were shown in the Fig 5. The results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time.\nThe results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time. There would be only more than 40 people that were infection and finally recovered at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. The overall period of COVID outbreak was less than 100 days.\nAmong a variety of factors leading to emergence and outbreaks of ID, the key issues are population density and human mobility where in these cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to at least 146 countries and territories on 6 continents in 2 months.\nAs implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. For COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [11] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results showed that under strong suppression of “lockdown Hubei”, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression ...\nContent:\nFor each scenario, we modeled the first suppression to have been initiated at the median threshold for the setting that has been observed to date (i.e., LICs and LMICs initiate earlier than UMICs and HICs, Table 1). We then selected the ICU incidence trigger within this range that minimizes COVID-19 mortality over 18 months and remains under our ICU threshold. We use a time window of 18 months as representative of the time scale over which pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., a vaccine) may become available, noting that this duration is highly uncertain (25).\nA full understanding of these will only be available retrospectively. Although our results illustrate the challenges that many countries will face in attempting to mitigate the impact of local COVID-19 epidemics, it is important to bear in mind that even moderate levels of changes in behavior can avert many infections and hence save millions of lives (30). Although suppression will always have the greatest impact on COVID-related morbidity and mortality, the intensity of interventions required needs to be balanced against the wider health risks that diverting all attention to a single disease could entail (31, 32).\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, supports the claim that COVID-19 suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time. The information is based on research from the Imperial College London, which has directly informed U.K. policy. The findings suggest that suppressing the outbreak rather than mitigating it would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die in the U.K. and the United States.\n\nInformation 2, while published later, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of the report by Neil Ferguson et al. on decision-making during the crisis, and the two strategies (mitigation and suppression) investigated in the report.\n\nInformation 3, like Information 1, supports the claim. It explains that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time, based on the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 and the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity.\n\nInformation 4, while discussing a different topic (a feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies), does not contradict the claim. It presents a scenario where the outbreak of COVID-19 is successfully controlled through suppression strategies.\n\nInformation 5, like Information 4, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression, but does not argue against the claim that suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is likely true. Suppression is presented as the only viable strategy for minimizing the toll of the new coronavirus in Information 1, 3, and the claim. The other information does not contradict this claim.", "response": "TRUE."}

Two tests were positive for COVID-19 infection. Since then, the number of infected persons in Brazil has increased dramatically [14]. Physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 16th [5]. Events expected to attract large numbers of people were cancelled, universities and schools were closed, and only services considered essential to the population remained functional, such as markets, pharmacies and bakeries.\nTo document how the containment measures affected the lives of the Brazilian people, and to understand which containment measures were best adhered to by which strata of the population, we conducted an online survey on the adherence of the Brazilian people to individual public health measures and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives.\nIn another large online survey in Brazil conducted between April 24th and May 24th, assessing only the degree of adherence to physical contact restriction measures, greater adherence was found among females compared to males but it was mainly the 30 to 49 year old group that was less adherent and not the younger age group [23]. People living in rural areas and poor neighborhoods were also less adherent: in rural areas people may not perceive themselves at high risk of COVID-19, and therefore may not respect the national restriction measures and not practice individual hygiene measures [24]. Therefore, extra communication and health education may be needed to change the risk perception in rural areas and popular neighborhoods [25]. Brazilian students reported difficulties to stay home, which may be related to a need to travel to their original homes in periods when schools and universities were closed [26] or could be related to differing social habits among this population.\nThis is a concern, as older age and the presence of (an) underlying health condition(s) are associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality [30, 31] On the other hand, Brazilian respondents with underlying diseases adhered better to the containment measures.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil's COVID-19 guidelines: political hijack of public health ...\nContent:\nBahia School of Medicine and Public Health, Salvador 40290-000, BrazilSearch for articles by this author ...

In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks, steam sterilization (e.g. in laminate sterilization wrappings) of used masks at 121 ⁰C in laminated bags, is a simple, useful, cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks safe for reuse.\nIn preparation for that scarcity we performed a study to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks in order to verify their re-usability with a method that could be applied in practice using already available equipment. Therefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags.\nTherefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes are sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus based on the knowledge of inactivation of such viruses. [1,2] A blind comparison of unused sterilized masks was performed with respect to visual inspection, consistency, face fit and breathing resistance.\nBefore sterilization, the batches were individually packed in laminate bags and sterilized with steam sterilization by means of 121 ⁰C in Getinge autoclaves and in combination with permeable laminate bags, Halyard type CLFP150X300WI-S20. The autoclaves were activated on a 121 ⁰C program and validated accordingly.

The new coronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, and ultraviolet disinfection does not affect the filtration efficiency of respirators.\nThe premise of using the mask again after disinfection is that the sterilized mask can neither affect the free circulation of air nor destroy the filtering mechanism of the mask. So, what kind of disinfection can meet these two points? To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23.

Chertow · Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—can involve the pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system1. A few studies have investigated cardiovascular outcomes in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19; however, most were limited to hospitalized individuals (who represent the minority of people with COVID-19), and all had a short duration of follow-up and a narrow selection of cardiovascular outcomes2,3,4,5.\nA comprehensive assessment of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae of the cardiovascular system at 12 months is not yet available, and studies of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae across the spectrum of care settings of the acute infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care) are also lacking. Addressing this knowledge gap will inform post-acute COVID-19 care strategies. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 153,760 US veterans who survived the first 30 d of COVID-19 and two control groups: a contemporary cohort consisting of 5,637,647 users of the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a historical cohort (pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic) consisting of 5,859,411 non-COVID-19-infected VHA users during 2017.\nCare strategies of people who survived the acute episode of COVID-19 should include attention to cardiovascular health and disease. The broader implications of these findings are clear. Cardiovascular complications have been described in the acute phase of COVID-19 (refs. 6,7,8). Our study shows that the risk of incident cardiovascular disease extends well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of COVID-19 infection on the cardiovascular system: An ...\nContent:\nThrough these direct and indirect mechanisms, the heart is at an increased risk of experiencing permanent damage in vulnerable population groups who become infected with COVID-19, often resulting in myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases [62]. Although there is no consensus on treating these conditions, the primary recommendation is to treat the patient's underlying conditions and any new conditions that may occur, including myocardial infarction. Some medical providers administer low–molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin in acutely ill patients to avoid clotting. Further studies have indicated that there may be some benefit to administering fibrinolytic therapy whenever possible over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially to avoid unnecessary “hardware” to a person that would otherwise not need it [64].\nAs kidney pathology has a functional interface with the cardiovascular system, it is not surprising that renal manifestations are thought to contribute to the short- and long-term cardiovascular events observed in COVID-19 patients [32,38]. When researchers in New Orleans evaluated 287 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, they found that patients with metabolic syndrome were 3.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals without metabolic syndrome [39]. These deadly outcomes are often related to cardiovascular events as metabolic syndromes significantly increase a person's risk of developing a spectrum of cardiovascular conditions, such as cardiac dysfunction, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, microvascular dysfunction, and heart failure [40]. The underlying mechanisms responsible for kidney and heart disease co-existence include leukocyte infiltration into the myocardium and increased cytokine secretions that contribute to myocardial inflammation, injury, an\nAlthough there is no consensus about the treatment of these conditions, the main recommendation is to address the underlying conditions of the patient and any new conditions, including myocardial infarction, that may arise. In acutely ill patients, some medical practitioners prescribe low–molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin to prevent clotting. Further studies have shown that delivering fibrinolytic therapy can be of some benefit. Many studies also focus on inhibiting viral replication and suppressing the excessive immune response to treat the COVID-19-induced endothelial damage and dysfunction.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of COVID-19 on Cardiovascular Disease - PMC\nContent:\nA chronic inflammatory response induced by viral persistence in heart tissue, molecular mimicry that invokes an autoimmune response to cardiac antigens, persistent endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, as well as arterial stiffening and a persistently high oxidative burden have been proposed to maintain cardiac and vascular dysfunction in post-COVID subjects [128,140]. Studies that analyzed cardiac MRIs after acute COVID-19 reported abnormalities in up to 78% of cases in up to 71 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including elevated T1 values (indicating fibrosis or inflammation), T2 values (indicating oedema), or myocarditis-like late gadolinium enhancement [141,142,143]. In another study investigating 52 of 584 patients (9%) that were suspected to have cardiovascular Long COVID, 15% had myocardial injury, 8% had pulmonary embolisms, and 4% had both CV entities [144]. Cardiovascular Long COVID symptoms may also be related to an increased disease burden observed within 12 months aft\nImpaired hospital accessibility, limited healthcare system capacity, reduced cardiovascular diagnostic testing, and delayed admission after symptom onset may have contributed to the reported increased risk for complications and worse outcomes following ACS [76,77,78]. Aside from general effects of the pandemic on care and outcomes of ACS patients, COVID-19 also appears to affect the incidence and outcome of ACS. A recent study estimated risks and one-year disease burden of a set of pre-specified incident CV outcomes, including ACS.\n\nInformation 1 describes a new study that shows a significant number of people who develop COVID-19 may experience serious cardiovascular complications. The review of available evidence indicates that COVID-19 is sometimes associated with serious cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure and heart attacks, as well as blood clots. The co-author of the review, Dr. William Brady, emphasizes the need for emergency physicians to be aware of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. The study also highlights possible interactions between drugs currently being tested as COVID-19 treatments and medication administered for cardiovascular problems.\n\nInformation 2 provides more details on the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. A chronic inflammatory response induced by viral persistence in heart tissue, molecular mimicry that invokes an autoimmune response to cardiac antigens, persistent endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, as well as arterial stiffening and a persistently high oxidative burden have been proposed to maintain cardiac and vascular dysfunction in post-COVID subjects. Studies have reported abnormalities in up to 78% of cases in up to 71 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiovascular Long COVID symptoms may also be related to an increased disease burden observed within 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nInformation 3 is a study that uses the vast and rich national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a large cohort of people with COVID-19. The study aims to investigate incident cardiovascular disease in the post-acute phase of the disease.

However, the information provided describes various studies and reviews regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system.\n\nGiven the information provided, it is clear that COVID-19 can have a significant impact on the cardiovascular system. The virus can cause various cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, heart attacks, and blood clots. The cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 can persist beyond the acute phase of the disease, leading to post-acute cardiovascular dysfunction.

Governor Ford arrived in Carthage and sent word to Smith that if he did not surrender, Ford would call out the militia. On June 18, Smith declared martial law in Nauvoo and called out the Nauvoo Legion, an organized city militia of about 5,000 men, to protect Nauvoo from outside violence.\nAs a result of the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Massachusetts Government Act, one of the Intolerable Acts, which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law. During the War of 1812, US General Andrew Jackson imposed martial law in New Orleans, Louisiana before repulsing the British in the Battle of New Orleans.\nPeople in the neighboring town of Carthage, Illinois, felt that Smith was abusing his position in order to avoid arrest. They requested that Governor Ford call out the militia to take Smith into custody, which Governor Ford declined to do. A group of ex-Mormons published a paper called the Nauvoo Expositor which detailed Smith's alleged abuse of power.

Researchers are intent on finding out why. “For almost every infectious disease, the most vulnerable populations are at the extremes of age — the very young and the very old,” said Stanford Medicine professor of microbiology and immunology and of pathology Bali Pulendran, PhD. “But with COVID-19, the young are spared while the old are emphatically not.\nThe scientists pivoted to a study of COVID-19 in kids. Florian Wimmers, PhD, then a postdoc in Pulendran’s lab, and his colleagues got hold of nasal and blood samples collected from 54 infants who’d become infected with SARS-CoV-2 before reaching age 2, and from 27 other children who’d tested negative throughout the observation period. For comparison, the researchers obtained similar samples from several dozen adults. All infected children in the study were, at most, mildly symptomatic.\nAnother difference: In the blood of adults with even mild COVID-19 cases, there was a big increase in levels of a number of inflammation-promoting signaling proteins, previously shown to be associated with more-severe symptoms. In infected kids’ blood, this increase wasn’t seen.\nPulendran wants to see if any of this nasal magic extends beyond COVID-19 — he is now collaborating with the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital group on influenza and other viruses. He suspects that his COVID-19 findings may not translate directly to other respiratory infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 in Early Life: Infants and Children Are Affected Too - PMC\nContent:\nThis meta-analysis revealed that 3.2% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had positive nasopharyngeal tests after birth (19). The virus was also detected in the cord blood and placenta and fecal or rectal swabs of neonates. Among cases where serology was tested, 3.7% was confirmed positive based on the presence of immunoglobulin M. These results have come mostly from case reports, and there is still not consensus over whether SARS-CoV-2 is vertically transmitted via the placenta to the fetus.\nAlthough COVID-19 infection is most commonly asymptomatic or mild in children, severe disease can occur as well. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37). Older children are also more likely to present with symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell (38).\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37).

Among 263 infants in the study, adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, NICU admission, and respiratory disease did not differ between those born to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those born to mothers testing negative.

The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade. To be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.

However, experts told ABC News that the findings from the review have not been accurately represented and that evidence shows masks do help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-10-14, is a review by Health Feedback stating that scientific evidence supports the use of face masks as an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19. The claim that a CDC study shows that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers is false.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-05-24, is a fact sheet by Delaware's Division of Public Health stating that masks are effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly. Masks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, especially important for asymptomatic or presymptomatic people.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-02-10, is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published on 2020-10-12, states that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\nThe claim is false, as multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Information 1, 3, and 4 all state that masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Information 5 is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a case-control study, which is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention when it is widely used.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19 is false. Multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

This post is authored by Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based academic and author of The Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy.\nShaping the 2022 election is important in a country where in recent years many outgoing presidents face hostile successors, and—like former presidents Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo—have wound up under house arrest or in jail after leaving office for crimes allegedly committed back when they were president. Duterte’s controversial rule, which has coincided with thousands of extrajudicial killings and intense cleavages between him and the country’s leading businessmen, has created no shortage of enemies for him. If Duterte leaves office with his legacy in tatters, he could be extremely vulnerable to political persecution if not legal prosecution at home. Thus, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines, the economic shocks of which will echo for years to come, will impact not only Duterte’s legacy but also the post-2022 scenario in the Philippines’ rapidly evolving political landscape.\nThe actual numbers of infected could be in tens of thousands, if not higher, making the Philippines one of Asia’s biggest hot spots. ...

By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.

Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities.

However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nInformation 5, published after the claim, states that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, costing Rs. 1,200 ($16.42) per dose. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context. The claim should have specified that the vaccine is free of cost in public healthcare facilities in India, but not necessarily in private healthcare facilities.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. This information is from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making it a reliable source.

In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705).

Schlottau K, Rissmann M, Graaf A, Schön J, Sehl J, Wylezich C, et al. SARS-CoV-2 in fruit bats, ferrets, pigs, and chickens: an experimental transmission study. Lancet Microbe. (2020) 1:e218–25. doi: 10.1016/s2666-5247(20)30089-6 · PubMed Abstract | CrossRef Full Text | Google Scholar\nIntermediate spillover hosts were not necessarily required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-1, since a bat SARS-like coronavirus is able to bind to ACE2 in humans and civets for cell entry (34). Nonetheless, civets may have amplified the virus and brought it closer to humans (35). Additional mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, common marmosets, grivets, and cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be infected under experimental inoculation, seroconvert, and display similar pathological signs as humans, and the monkeys and guinea pigs usually display mild clinical signs, while cats and golden hamsters show no clinical signs (36–44).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study conducted by Tufts University and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences found that bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. They also discovered a virus in pigs in 2016, SADS-CoV, which originated from bats and can infect various organisms, including humans.\n\nInformation 2: A fact-checking article by TEMPO states that the Wuhan coronavirus did not originate from a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus. Instead, it originated mostly from SARS and bats.\n\nInformation 3: An article discussing how China's 'Bat Woman' hunted down viruses from SARS to the new coronavirus states that pigs and humans have similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species. The SADS virus, which originated from bats, can infect cells from many organisms, including humans.\n\nInformation 4: An article about the novel coronavirus found in Wuhan states that it has been found in 15 patients and no new cases have been reported since January 5, 2020.\n\nInformation 5: A scientific article published in the Lancet Microbe states that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats, and SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the 2013 and 2019 isolates from horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China at the genome level. However, they are not immediately related to the human ACE2 receptor.\n\nClaim: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is false. Information 1, 3, and 5 all indicate that while bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence to suggest that the Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus. Information 2 explicitly states that the Wuhan coronavirus did not originate from a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus. Additionally, Information 5 states that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats, and is most closely related to the 2013 and 2019 isolates from horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China at the genome level, but not at the RBD level, suggesting that it may not bind to human ACE2 and is not an immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.

More than 170 countries are poised to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, the WHO reported last week.

The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19. The plan is backed by many U.S. allies, including Germany, Japan and the European Commission and appealed to some members of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. However, Trump has criticized the WHO for what he calls its “China-centric” response to the pandemic, so the U.S. won’t partner with the organization.\nWhen countries opt out, that makes it more difficult to meet the goals of lower vaccine costs, better health outcomes and fewer COVID-19 deaths, the newspaper reported. The decision also likely eliminates the chance that the U.S. could secure vaccine doses from a pool of vaccine candidates across the world.

In the uncontrolled first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, R 0 was around 2·4.20 With intensive contact tracing and the isolation of infected individuals, in addition to the implementation of a range of public health and social measures,21 the effective reproduction rate can be reduced to less than 1, and the epidemic will decline.\nSection 2 provides an annotated chronology of the COVID-19 pandemic and thematic findings regarding several issues. Section 3 presents our policy recommendations, particularly around multilateral cooperation centred at WHO to address global health crises, and around investments in preparedness for future health crises through strong national health systems and international financing and technology cooperation with the world's lower-income regions. The Lancet COVID-19 Commission was established in July, 2020, with four main themes: developing recommendations on how to best suppress the epidemic; addressing the humanitarian crises arising from the pandemic; addressing the financial and economic crises resulting from the pandemic; and rebuilding an inclusive, fair, and sustainable world.1 The 28 Commissioners are global experts in public policy, international cooperation, epidemiology and vaccinology, economics and financial systems, sustainability sciences, and mental health.\nIdentifying these origins would provide greater clarity into not only the causes of the current pandemic but also vulnerabilities to future outbreaks and strategies to prevent them. We concur with the position of 18 leading scientists who wrote in Science magazine44 in May, 2021: “We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data.” As a group of 16 scientists communicated in The Lancet 45 in October, 2021: “Overwhelming evidence for either a zoonotic or research-related origin is lacking: the jury is still out.” More than 2 years into the pandemic, the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete and inconclusive.46, 47 Independent experts consulted by the Lancet COVID-19 Commission shared the view that hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers are in play and need further investigation.\nThis Fund should combine and expand the operations of several existing health funds and add new funding for three windows of financing: commodities for disease control, pandemic preparedness and response, and primary health system strengthening in LMICs. We propose that the Global Health Fund should have its headquarters in (Continues on next page)(Key recommendations continued from previous page)Geneva, Switzerland, but have strong regional offices in each of the six WHO regions.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: The Lancet article \"COVID-19 is not a pandemic\" refers to COVID-19 as a syndemic, which clusters with pre-existing conditions and is driven by larger political, economic, and social factors.

However, based on the provided information, this claim is false. The Lancet has not denied the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, they have referred to COVID-19 as a syndemic, which emphasizes the social and economic inequalities caused by the pandemic.

The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nYou might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.\nIn January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: Scientists find COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly\nContent:\nBy clicking \"Allow All\" you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage and support us in providing free open access scientific content.

Previous findings indicate that antibodies to those viruses last at least a year and often longer, they said. In combination with certain previous findings on COVID-19 antibodies, the researchers concluded that their results \"might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 'immunity passports' and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups and widespread testing.\"\nAmid Omicron, relative to participants without long COVID, those with long COVID at 2 years had significantly higher rates of reinfection and pneumonia. ...

The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nIn the recent study published in Science, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a database of immune responses from 30,000 New Yorkers who tested positive for the coronavirus between March and October and monitored 121 volunteers over time.\nIn the U.K. study, scientists at Imperial College London found that antibody prevalence in the British participants fell from 6 percent at roughly the end of June to 4.4 percent in September. And using at-home tests that were distributed to more than 365,000 people, the researchers observed a more than 26 percent decline in antibody levels over three months.\nBut despite the seemingly divergent results from the two studies, they can both be true, according to Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the molecular microbiology and immunology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not unreasonable — or particularly alarming — if antibody levels decline rapidly after a person recovers and then persist for some time at a much lower level, he said.\nBelgian student Lili Deneve, who has recovered from Covid-19, donates plasma at the Belgian Red Cross blood collection center in Brussels on Oct. 27, 2020.Francois Lenoir / Reuters ...

Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better.

Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.\nFinally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system. Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well.\nThe most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon. Our preliminary inventory of food medicines serves as a baseline for future systematic ethnobotanical studies and aims to inspire in-depth research on how use patterns of plant-based foods and beverages, both “traditional” and “new”, are changing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020), a botánica (shop selling Caribbean remedies for health and wellbeing) in the Bronx reported selling much greater volumes online of eucalyptus, chamomile, and anamú (Petiveria alliacea L.), to treat COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, fever, and trouble breathing, together with other plants that allegedly ease anxiety.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions.

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic. Key Words: Burnout, COVID-19, Nurses, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2022-03-02\nTitle: What Nurse Leaders Should Know About PTSD in Nurses During COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nThe Journal of Nursing Administration2 recently published a study aiming to explore the connection between nurses’ practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The results can be used by nurse leaders to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nursing staff members working during COVID-19.\nInterventions can improve the recognition of psychological symptoms among nurses exposed to traumatic events. Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found a significant correlation between PTSD and BOS, and that the pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma, increasing PTSD among HCWs.\n\nInformation 3, published on March 2, 2022, discusses a study published in The Journal of Nursing Administration that explores the connection between nurses' practice environment, PTSD, and intent to leave among nurses working during the pandemic. The study aims to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions for nursing staff members.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, highlights the importance of preventing PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients.

The study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that \"PTSD can strike nurses, especially during COVID-19\" is supported by all the provided information. The correlation between PTSD and the COVID-19 pandemic among nurses is evident in Information 2 and 5.

These posts, shared in at least three countries, claim to provide advice on how to legally decline a vaccine.

It explains that the series of advice on refusing vaccines is circulating as scientists around the world rush to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

BOGOTA — Colombia reached 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, becoming the second country in Latin America to report that number in less than a week.\n“The fear is it’s going to be worse,” Rodriguez said on a recent afternoon. Argentina hit 1 million confirmed cases on Monday and Peru and Mexico are expected to reach the grim marker in the weeks ahead. Brazil ranks third worldwide in the number of virus cases and passed 1 million infections back in June. Overall, Latin America continues to register some of the highest caseloads, diagnosing more than 100,000 confirmed infections each day, though the World Health Organization reports that Europe is now seeing even larger numbers as a second virus wave strikes.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 20, 2020, is a news article debunking the claim that the WHO recognized Colombia as the most organized country in the prevention of coronavirus in America or the second in the world.

Information 1, published on the same day as the claim, debunks this statement, stating that there is no record of such recognition from the WHO. Additionally, Information 3 and 5 show that the coronavirus situation in Colombia has been challenging, with high numbers of cases and a rising trend. Therefore, it is unlikely that Colombia was recognized for its prevention efforts.\n\nThe other pieces of information, while relevant, do not provide evidence for or against the claim. Information 2 and 4 are general overviews of Colombia's health situation and travel advisory, respectively, and do not mention anything about the WHO's recognition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Trump, however, has repeatedly denied that the rise in cases reflects increased transmission of the virus, and has instead insisted that increased testing is the cause. The president began pinning the blame on testing as early as June 15, when in a tweet he said that because U.S. testing “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country … it shows more cases.” He called testing a “double edged sword” because it is “good to” have, but “[m]akes us look bad.”\nLater in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths. “Cases up only because of our big number testing,” he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. “Mortality rate way down!!!” · The same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, discusses the increasing coronavirus death toll in the United States, which was about 80,000 at the time.

The claim was originally shared on an alternative medical website and by Andrew Saul, who calls himself the \"Megavitamin Man.\" The claim has been fact-checked and found to be false.

In a media call announcing $1.6 billion in funding for immunization in poor countries, Gates said the misinformation about his work on vaccines was so weird that he found it difficult to understand – and he categorically denied he’s involved in any sort of microchipping conspiracy.\nIn a poll conducted May 20 and 21 by Yahoo/YouGov, 44% of Republicans said they believed the microchip conspiracy theory, compared with 19% of Democrats.

In the chat, he predicted that one day, we would all carry a digital passport for our health records. He suggested not a microchip, but some kind of e-vaccine card that people could flash before going into a business. The next day, a Swedish website that reads like a tabloid full of memes about biohacking wrote about Gates’ comment.\nThe pastor’s nine-minute sermon tapped into a long-standing, wide-ranging conspiracy theory that Gates, through his business and philanthropy, is trying to “depopulate” the planet. The pastor titled the post, “Bill Gates – Microchip Vaccine Implants to fight Coronavirus,” adding one pivotal word to the biohackers’ title: vaccine.\nThe early SNL star didn’t even need to prompt Stone before he launched in. “Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate,” Stone said. “He and other globalists are definitely using it in a drive for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.”\nThe bloggers connected Gates’ remark with various research projects supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, including one December 2019 study exploring invisible “quantum dot” tattoos that could reveal your vaccine history when held close to a special smartphone light. Then, CyphR acknowledged, they made a fateful “jump” — by suggesting the best way to implement Gates’ idea was through an implantable microchip.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-15\nTitle: Fact check: Bill Gates is not planning to microchip the world through ...\nContent:\nThere is no evidence Bill Gates is trying to implant microchips in people around the world through COVID-19 vaccines.

In order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus which gave rise to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019, governments brought in health measures at varying levels of strictness to restrict the movement of people and transmission of the virus.\nBetween August and October 2021, several protests were held across New Zealand to protest official lockdown measures, vaccination, and spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Key groups and individuals that were involved in these protests included FACTS NZ, Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa, the NZ Liberty Movement and Jami-Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika's Advance New Zealand party.

While the limitations noted underscore the need for caution with interpreting a causal relationship from our findings, the results do support the notion that it is possible to protest safely in the midst of a pandemic, ostensibly, so long as evidence-based precautionary measures are taken [48]. As the pandemic continues into its second year, public demonstrations related to COVID-19 and societal issues remain fixtures of daily life around the world [49]. Further research is needed to understand both the individual-level relationship between protest participation, SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality, particularly with more virulent strains such as the Delta variant resulting in breakthrough cases among vaccin\nThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship between public protests and county-level, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization rates across California. Publicly available data were included in the analysis from 55 of 58 California state counties (29 March–14 October 2020). Mixed-effects negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between daily county-level COVID-19 hospitalizations and two main exposure variables: any vs. no protests and 1 or >1 protest vs. no protests on a given county-day.\nThree spline variables were created to represent the three time periods in our models based on visual observation of average changes in county hospitalization rates over time (see Supplementary Figure S1 for observed vs. predicted COVID-19 hospitalization rates using this time trend). The knots (1 June and 21 July) were also selected since they provided the best model fit to predict COVID-19 hospitalization using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). To explore patterns in the data, graphs were used to describe (1) the daily average COVID-19 hospitalization rate and the total number of protests across the total sample of 55 counties, and (2) the proportion of protests by protest type, overall and for the counties with any protests.\nEthical review and approval were waived for this study since only publicly available data were used.

This paper proposes a holistic approach to explore the relationship between societal conditions and the emergence of protests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the following sections we introduce a holistic analysis approach to the emergence of civil resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we discuss the theoretical basis of our approach and develop a casual loop diagram to capture these findings and conceptually model the emergence of civil resistance at a societal level. Using this conceptual model, several hypotheses on the impact of societal conditions to the emergence of protests are tested.\nWith this computational approach, we can test whether existing theoretical models for the emergence of protests provide a realistic explanation for the emergence of protest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our CLD and statistical analysis, we can model latent processes that yield protests as a function of significant factors identified with our statistical analysis.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread.

Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe.

Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4). Naturally, the origins of the epidemic were investigated. All the studies of Shi Zhengli, the lead virologist from the institute, on bat related coronaviruses were centered in the southern, subtropical areas of Yunnan. However, the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, which is almost 900 km from Yunnan. This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nUp to 96% similarity was found between SARS-COV-2 and the bat coronavirus using whole-genome analysis [7]. This theory was supported by other studies that have been summarized in detail elsewhere [8, 9]. A study supported this suggestive finding by using sequence-based analysis and artificial intelligence on the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus [10]. Snakes were found to be the most probable wildlife repository for the virus compared with other animals [11]. Conversely, another study suggested that SARS-COV-2 could have originated from bats but with pangolins as the possible intermediate hosts [12].\nIn conclusion, all these specific features observed in SARS-COV-2 helps scientists to rule out the idea that this pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is the result of a man-made action that could be either engineered in the laboratory or further created as a bioweapon out of conspiracy.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-06-14\nTitle: Nature-based or lab leak? Unraveling the debate over the origins ...\nContent:\nABC News also reported in June 2020 that satellite images showed dramatic spikes in auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the novel coronavirus may have been present before the outbreak was first reported to the world.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-12\nTitle: How we know the COVID-19 coronavirus wasn't made in a lab\nContent:\nSo there's no evidence suggesting that it was manmade or laboratory created somehow. Narrator: So what if they went with the other option and mutated an existing virus? This is known as serial passage and acts in a similar way to selective breeding. Scientists are able to mimic evolution, to a degree. By forcing the virus to mutate over and over again into a potentially different form. This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.\nNarrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has. So creating a new, deadly backbone is pretty much impossible. But there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\nBut there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.

It mentions genetic studies that found up to 96% similarity between SARS-COV-2 and bat coronaviruses, and also suggests that pangolins could be possible intermediate hosts. However, the information concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 14, 2021, reports on satellite images showing increased auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present before the outbreak was reported to the world.\n\nInformation 3, published on June 12, 2020, explains that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 was manmade or laboratory-created. It also explains that creating a new virus with significant devastation is currently impossible, but notes that a virus could be created in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 1, 2020, is a fact-check that debunks the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory. It cites the genetics of the virus as evidence that it has natural origins.\n\nInformation 5, published on March 26, 2020, reports on scientists analyzing the coronavirus to reveal its natural origins and debunk conspiracy theories suggesting that it was created in a lab.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory is not supported by the available evidence. Information 4 and 5, both published before the claim, debunk this theory and provide evidence for the natural origins of the virus. Information 1 also concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action. Therefore, the claim is likely false.\n\nIt is important to note that Information 2, published after the claim, suggests the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present in Wuhan before the outbreak was reported to the world. However, this information does not support the claim that the virus was artificially created in a laboratory. Additionally, Information 3 explains that while it is possible to create a virus in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point, there is no evidence to suggest that this is what happened with SARS-COV-2.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory is not supported by the available evidence. The scientific consensus is that the virus has natural origins, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was created in a lab. Therefore, the claim is likely false.", "response": "FALSE."}

He is well known outside Spain for his \"Alatriste\" ...\nPérez-Reverte's novels are usually centered on one strongly defined character, and his plots move along swiftly, often featuring a narrator who is part of the story but apart from it. Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the Mediterranean. They often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea.\nPérez-Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper Pueblo and then for Televisión Española (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer.\nThey often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea. The novels frequently deal with some of the major issues of modern Spain, such as drug trafficking or the relationship of religion and politics.

However, differences in underlying health conditions among Black and Asian people, obtained from primary care records, were able to explain only a quarter of the excess deaths from COVID-19.[2]\nCOVID-19 patients who are admitted to critical care or who die in hospital include a disproportionately large number of people from ethnic minorities.[1][2] In the UK, one in three patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 has been from an ethnic minority group, although they make up only one in eight of the UK population.[3] The excess risk of severe COVID-19 to people from ethnic minorities is visible not only in hospital admissions, but also in the community. In a national cohort of 6 million veterans in the USA, Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested and to test positive for COVID-19 than Whites.[4] In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysed all deaths in England and Wales with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nPeople in ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with higher exposure to coronavirus infection, which could result in more cases of COVID-19.[1] On the other hand, ethnic minority populations tend to be younger on average than the UK population, and younger people are less susceptible to severe illness following infection. The total numbers of deaths recorded in hospitals are similar per capita for Black African and White ethnic groups.\nThe difference was particularly large for Black men and women, who were more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 than White men and women.[5] Can these differences be explained in terms of exposure to coronavirus infection, or susceptibility to severe illness and death following infection, or both?\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds are more likely to die ...\nContent:\nAfter adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian backgrounds were 1.49 times more likely to die compared to those from white backgrounds, and patients from black backgrounds were 1.30 times more likely to die.

Some posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ).\nBy mid-March, factory production data continued to underscore the impact of the pandemic on the country, as Chinese stocks fell again to six-week lows, ( here ). The claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the virus is therefore untrue. As it begins to ease its strict coronavirus curbs, China has urged authorities to pay more attention to asymptomatic cases, as part of efforts to allay public fears that large numbers of infectious people have gone unreported. Residents and medical staff in Wuhan told Reuters that testing problems at some hospitals meant that some infected people were not identified, and thus were not included in official data.\nSome posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ). Some posts go on to include further claims alluding to a possible conspiracy by the Chinese government and Democratic party members in the U.S. to financially cripple America and negatively frame President Donald Trump’s administration. In early February, when cities like Wuhan were in lockdown, fears about the spreading of the coronavirus wiped $393 billion off China’s stock market, despite government support moves, Reuters reported ( here ). A nearly 8% plunge on the Shanghai composite index was its biggest daily fall in more than four years.\nDespite criticisms related to the Chinese government’s lack of transparency, official coronavirus data released by Chinese health officials and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) do disprove the claims made on social media that only Wuhan was affected.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25].

The call began with a…\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-16, is a fact-check report discrediting a claim that a woman named Sarah Beltran Ponce killed her unborn child because she was vaccinated against something that does not exist. The fact-check report reveals that the woman in the photo is not Sarah Beltran Ponce but Amy Guy Ulrich, and she did not have an abortion. Her photo was manipulated and used in a false narrative on the internet.\n\nInformation 2, the source and date are not provided, contains various examples from the Bible that question God's pro-life stance. The examples include God killing every first-born child of every family in Egypt, a man murdering his concubine for being raped, God commanding parents to beat their children, and God commanding the Israelites to kill all the inhabitants of the land, including men, women, children, and animals.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2006-10-19, is an article about a woman named Tammy Skinner who shot herself in the belly, killing her unborn child. Skinner was charged with carrying out an illegal abortion, but the charges were later dismissed. The article discusses the debate over the case and the argument that if a woman has the right to kill her unborn child, why should it be illegal for her to do so with a gun as opposed to in a doctor's office.\n\nInformation 4, the source and date are not provided, contains a verse from the Bible, 1 Samuel 15:3, which commands the Israelites to kill all the inhabitants of the land, including men, women, children, and animals, and not to spare anything.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-05-17, is an article about a woman named Deanna Laney who killed her three sons, claiming that God told her to do so.\n\nClaim Veracity:\n\nThe claim that a woman killed her unborn child because she was vaccinated against something that does not exist is false, as confirmed by Information 1. The woman in the photo did not have an abortion, and her photo was manipulated and used in a false narrative on the internet.\n\nThe claim does not mention God or religion, so the other information about God's stance on pro-life and related Bible verses is not relevant to the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false based on the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19. In this study, we tested four commercially available mouthwash/gargle formulations and salt water against SARS-CoV-2.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Gargling Salt Water Could Lower COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk\nContent:\nRinsing your throat or nose with a salt water (saline) solution may help protect against severe COVID-19 infection, based on a new study presented this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Anaheim, California. The research found that the risk of hospitalization for people with the virus who regularly gargled with salt water or used it as a nasal rinse (as with a neti pot) was significantly lower than for individuals in a reference group who did not follow a saline regimen.\nTsai C et al. Possible Beneficial Role of Throat Gargling in the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. Public Health. August 2020. Rothwell J. U.S. Adults' Estimates of COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk. Gallup. September 27, 2021.\n“This is just an anecdote, but I felt that gargling helped relieve my congestion and ability to breathe, which in turn improved my sleep.” · For the research, 58 individuals between ages 18 and 65 who tested positive for COVID-19 between 2020 and 2022 were selected to undergo either a low- or a high-dose saline regimen for five minutes, four times a day, over the course of 14 days.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Salt Water Gargle Vs. COVID-19: Researchers Launch Study to Lessen ...\nContent:\nSalt water gargle is a time-tested way to alleviate sore-throat pain. As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.

However, recent studies suggest that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid by reducing hospitalization rates in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

However, some experts, such as Volpicelli, do not like the undue focus on wireless devices for lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThe claim states that the first protocol on how to use lung ultrasound to triage COVID-19 has been published. This claim is consistent with the information provided, as information 1, 2, 3, and 4 discuss the publication of the first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection.

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency.\nIn the wake of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the practice of ophthalmology has undergone a dramatic and unprecedented shift. The inherent risk of transmission is high due to the need for patient proximity during an ophthalmic exam or surgery, which has led to at least one outbreak in Norway [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. In March 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued practice guidelines and released a list of emergent ophthalmic surgical procedures to be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15]. Subsequently, the rescheduling of routine ocular examinations and limiting procedures to those deemed urgent or emergent has been the basis of many recent publications [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Each has offered specialty specific guidelines to limit transmission moving forward, while allowing for the gradual increase in ophthalmic exams, intraocular injections, and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nAdherence to these recommendations has resulted in an estimated 75% or more reduction of in-person clinic volumes [28]. Concurrently, the implementation of telemedicine visits resulted in an alternative way to provide continued care [3, 25, 29,30,31]. However, the exact reduction of in-patient visits, increase in telemedicine encounters, and the change in the types of diagnoses seen within in an ophthalmology clinic before and after COVID-19 remains unknown.

The information provided shows that PCR tests are the most successful tests, with 80% sensitivity and 99% specificity. It is more common for PCR to diagnose a false negative than a false positive. While information 3 mentions that false positive RT-PCR results can occur due to contamination and other factors, the overall sensitivity of PCR tests is still high, and the rate of false positives is not as high as claimed. Additionally, information 5 reports two cases linked to Melbourne’s COVID outbreak were in fact false positives, indicating that false positives are not common.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

(There were differences among the vaccines, with Moderna’s primary series of two shots showing the highest effectiveness of 62% one month after the series, and Sinovac’s demonstrating the lowest effectiveness at 32%.) After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”.

After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected.

Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time.

If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines—including Google—do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Privacy Policy – Privacy & Terms – Google\nContent:\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

Google has been ranked \"Hostile to Privacy\" by Privacy International in 2007, and Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt expressed his views on transparency and identity verification in 2010. Google lifted its ban on personally-identifiable information in its DoubleClick ad service in 2016. Google I/O 2019 announced plans to limit data retention periods for certain services. Google's processing of Gmail message content has been questioned, but Google maintains that it doesn't read emails by humans.

However, this does not confirm the claim that Google has an application specifically designed for tracking users.\n\nConsidering the provided information and the general capabilities of Google's services, it is plausible that Google has access to user location and message data.

While Information 4 indicates that Uttar Pradesh Power DISCOMs are facing reduced collections due to the lockdown, there is no evidence suggesting that electricity bills have been waived off completely for consumers. Instead, Information 5 mentions that DISCOMs in Uttar Pradesh have been refusing to pay power generators, claiming an inability to collect power dues from consumers due to the force majeure of the Coronavirus outbreak. This information suggests that consumers are still expected to pay their electricity bills, although they might be facing difficulties in doing so due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, and the Uttar Pradesh government did not waive off electricity bills for consumers amid the COVID-19 lockdown.", "response": "FALSE."}

Now, just nine months after the Gates Foundation met with democratic congressman Bobby Rush, there is a bill introduced in the Congress called H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-11\nTitle: EXCLUSIVE: Bill Gates Negotiated $100 Billion Contact Tracing Deal ...\nContent:\n﻿ <strong>The</strong> <strong>Bill</strong> and Melinda <strong>Gates</strong> Foundation helped <strong>negotiate</strong> who would score <strong>a</strong> <strong>$100</strong> <strong>Billion</strong> government-backed <strong>contact</strong> <strong>tracing</strong> contract in August 2019 — <strong>six</strong> <strong>months</strong> <strong>before</strong> <strong>the</strong> ‘pandemic’ arrived in the United States and four <strong>months</strong> <strong>before</strong> it swept through China.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-13\nTitle: $100 Billion Contact Tracing Deal By Bill Gates Just Before Pandemic ...\nContent:\nAnd just last month — nine months after the meetings with the Gates Foundation in Rwanda — Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, introduced the $100 BILLION H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.

The claim originated from Rangitikei Environmental Health Watch and TruePundit.com, stating that six months before the COVID-19 pandemic, Bill Gates had negotiated a $100 billion contact tracing deal with a Democratic congressman sponsor of the bill. However, PolitiFact found no evidence of Gates collaborating on the bill, which would provide $100 billion to organizations that perform COVID-19 testing, conduct contact tracing, or provide services for individuals who are isolating at home.\n\nInformation 2, published by Lead Stories on June 14, 2020, is an article that rates the claim as false, stating that there is no evidence of Gates working with U.S. Rep.

There is no evidence of Gates collaborating on the bill, and the bill proposed by Rush would provide money not to Gates or his foundation but to organizations that provide COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, or other services.\n\nThe information that supports the claim is from unreliable sources, and there is no evidence to back up the claim.

WASHINGTON — The United States saw 2 million new COVID-19 cases in the first 16 days of November, a sign that the country has a rough winter ahead.\nPresident Trump claims that COVID-19 cases in the us are only going up because of more testing. The data tells a different story.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge 'Only' Due to Testing, Misleads ...\nContent:\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February.

Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization.

The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. These assertions are not backed up by the data, a ProPublica analysis shows. While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased. To be sure, the virus exacted a tremendous toll on New York state and on New York City. Though COVID-19 now appears to be under control, more than 389,000 residents of New York state were infected and more than 24,700 died.\nThe Trump administration has doubled down on its claims that coronavirus case counts are up because the U.S. has increased testing.

The WHO's 'Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe' policy framework does include guidance that children under the age of four should be given information about \"early childhood masturbation\" and encouraged to explore so-called gender identities. However, this information was published in 2020 and 2023, after the claim was made in 2020.

This is a rise from 605 in the previous week. Of these, 512 were registered in England, 47 in Wales, 56 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland. A total of 13,683 deaths were registered in the UK in the week ending 17 March 2023, which was 9.3% above the five-year average.

Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of the EU; however, its impact was not evenly spread. The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nData from Ireland were not included in the first phase of the excess mortality release: official timely data were not available because deaths in Ireland can be registered up to three months after the date of death. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland began to explore experimental ways of obtaining up-to-date mortality data.

They both debunk the claim that COVID-19 death tolls in Ireland, England, and Italy have been miscalculated and inflated. The information points out that the claim was made on Facebook without any source and is false. Italy did not miscalculate their death toll by 90%, and the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar did not confirm that Ireland's statistics are inflated. England did lower their official count by some 5,000, but that was due to a change in its classification of deaths related to the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3 is from a publication in 2023-03-27, which provides the latest insights on COVID-19 deaths in the UK.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false. These claims have been consistently debunked by multiple sources and there is no evidence to support them.", "response": "FALSE."}

PCR is used for a number of scientific processes, and in general, it amplifies bits of genetic information so that they can be detected within samples. But PCR tests are specific to the DNA they are testing for, whether that’s of a person or a virus, so aren’t “designed” to pick up the genetic material of the person being tested.\nHe didn’t say PCR testing couldn’t be used for testing for any diseases, as some social media posts claim.

Additionally, many of these posts have claimed that PCR testing returns a high number of false positives in a way that has inaccurately inflated the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19.\nThere are a few variants on the claim, but all of them make some reference to Kary Mullis, the American biochemist who created the PCR test, and suggest that he said the tests were not suitable for testing for viruses or Covid-19. PCR tests are used in Ireland and many other countries, and involve taking a swab from someone’s throat and nose and then using PCR – polymerase chain reaction – to detect the genetic material of the virus that causes Covid-19.\nAnother Facebook post, which has been shared 104 times, said that Mullins was the “inventor of the PCR Covid test” and that it was “not made to detect any kind of infectious disease.

Instead, he is clarifying that PCR identifies substances qualitatively not quantitatively, detecting the genetic sequences of viruses, but not the viruses themselves: “PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers.\nEven if Mullis had voiced a similar statement before his death in 2019, this quote does not mean the PCR test is unable to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - rather that it cannot determine whether the individual tested is infectious.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-08-31, is from Chequeado and states that there is no record of Kary Mullis, the creator of PCR tests, making a statement against their effectiveness.\n* Information 2, published on 2020-10-23, is from FullFact and explains that PCR tests are not designed to detect any type of infectious disease, but rather to pick up a signature of DNA and RNA of the person being tested.

From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising.

Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents.

She added, \"We are grateful to see that Philadelphians once again stepped up, responding to this pandemic with solidarity and care for each other.\nShe added, \"We are grateful to see that Philadelphians once again stepped up, responding to this pandemic with solidarity and care for each other. And that response and the data demonstrating its effectiveness makes it possible for us to announce today that we are rolling back Philadelphia's mask mandate in favor of a strong recommendation for indoor masking.\" Bettigole told the Board of Health at a public meeting Thursday night that hospitalizations had unexpectedly gone down 25% in a matter of days.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 | Programs and initiatives | City of Philadelphia\nContent:\nProviding services, support, and guidance to reduce the spread of <strong>COVID</strong>-19 <strong>in</strong> <strong>Philadelphia</strong>.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 contains details about Philadelphia's COVID-19 Response Levels, which are a series of metrics that tie the city's response to the pandemic to the current COVID-19 situation. The city implements mitigation measures when cases go up and lifts them when cases go down. On April 11, 2021, Philadelphia averaged 142 new cases per day. On April 22, 2022, the city announced that masks are strongly encouraged but not required in indoor public spaces due to a leveling-off of case counts and a decrease in hospitalizations.\n\nInformation 2 states that hospitalizations across the city have decreased by 50% over the past two weeks, and case rates in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware have also declined. Delaware, which ended its indoor mask mandate on April 15, 2022, has seen a 74% drop in new cases.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2013, provides general guidelines on mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. It recommends mask usage for people 2 years old and up in indoor public places, especially for those with weakened immune systems. Outdoor mask usage is suggested in crowded places and for outdoor get-togethers with close contact with unvaccinated individuals when COVID-19 cases are high in the area.\n\nInformation 4, published on April 22, 2022, announces that the City of Philadelphia will no longer use the COVID-19 Response Levels and will roll back the mask mandate in favor of a strong recommendation for indoor masking. This decision is based on data showing that hospitalizations have not continued to rise and that Philadelphians have responded to the pandemic with care for each other.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim \"Masks Use Up - COVID Cases Down in Philadelphia\" is not accurate. The claim seems to imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship between mask usage and the decrease in COVID-19 cases, while the actual situation is that the city has experienced a decrease in cases and hospitalizations, leading to the decision to roll back the mask mandate. The information does not provide evidence that mask usage directly caused the decrease in cases.", "response": "TRUE."}

Forged in opposition — first to the military regime, then to a series of democratically elected governments — the PT has held the Brazilian presidency since 2003, first under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and now under Dilma Rousseff.\nIndicators of change include ideological moderation, reform of internal decision-making structures, new relationships with civil society organisations, the willingness to ally with centre and right-wing parties, construction of a new electoral base among Brazil’s poor majority, and overall a general reorientation of the party’s public image.

On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Moreover, most of the people who use cannabis also report tobacco use concurrently. This fact may increase the risk of exposure to toxic substances, as certain co-users (for example, blunt users) tend to have higher levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled air and cannabis smoke may have higher levels of some carcinogens than tobacco smoke [7]. Previous studies have indicated that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease [8], metabolic syndromes and changes in the immune system [9].

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can.

The most famous example of pandemics in the pre-modern period was the plague, which repeatedly struck most of Europe and the Near East in successive waves across the centuries.\nIslamic ethical discussions on the themes of plagues and pandemics grew out of commentaries on specific references in the foundational sources: the Qurʾān and Prophetic reports. These references center around a number of moral questions such as: justification for these incidents; relationship between these events and divine destiny as well as the proper view and attitude of a believer towards these events; scope of human intervention and the extent to which such intervention is obligatory; impact of these incidents on ritual deeds; and finally impact of these incidents on social interpersonal interactions.\nHistorical accounts of the various epidemics and plague pandemics that struck different regions at different times show how Islamic normative discussions on topics such as contagion, illness, and medical treatment shaped the attitudes of Muslims during these times. One of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\nOne of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.

This article examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the global pandemic during its early months and provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives.\nDuring data collection, the authors identified six newly established pro-Islamic State groups and channels with coronavirus or pandemic names and themes, in both English and Arabic. Examples include the now defunct Telegram channels “The Pandemic,” “korounna,” and “COVID-19,” among others. Naming groups could be undertaken for various reasons to include: supporters exploiting a timely subject, supporters creating groups and channels dedicated to coronavirus news and discussion, or supporters evading pro-Islamic State group and channel shutdowns through the use of non-Islamic State-themed names.25 When considering the content within these groups and channels, the most plausible reasons are utilizing the newsworthy and global nature of the virus, along with a desire to discuss COVID-19 in environments of shared belief.\nIn turn, 11 dominant themes and narratives were identified, highlighting the ways in which decentralized online pro-Islamic State networks create content designed to appeal to a diverse audience, capitalize on a current event, as well as provide a space for community engagement and camaraderie in a time of social isolation. Although the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic brought much of the world to a stand-still, the internet has allowed people to remain virtually connected and updated on the latest COVID-19-related news, including violent extremist groups and terrorist organizations.\nIt is important to note that the framing of this category is not meant to infer that religion does not have bearing on other themes and narratives in the dataset, including the divine punishment and vindictive categories. Islamic State Coronavirus News: content that denotes the sharing of Islamic State news on the coronavirus. Socioeconomic Decay: content includes discussions on what life will look like after the pandemic: social unrest, economic devastation, and the collapse of society.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-14, discusses a specific instance of misinformation spreading on social media related to the coronavirus pandemic. This includes a video of a choir from Bosnia and Herzegovina that was falsely claimed to be a recording of musicians from various religious backgrounds reciting the 99 names of God in Islam during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. Additionally, a photo of an Egyptian doctor was shared with a false claim that he had invented a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the targeting of Muslims on social media during the coronavirus pandemic.

It provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives in pro-Islamic State media related to the pandemic.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a wave of Islamic-themed myths on social media.\n\nJudgement:\nThe claim is TRUE based on the available information.

Future research can examine how to strengthen T cells to better protect people who have previously gotten sick. However, no matter whether a person is vaccinated before or after they get COVID-19, vaccination against future cases of COVID-19 will still provoke a stronger immune response than the response of unvaccinated people.\nPeople who were vaccinated but had contracted COVID-19 before their vaccination had a lower number of CD8+ T cells, and people who had never been vaccinated had the lowest amount.

Besides the risk of infections owing to lowered immune functions, there is a possible risk of unknown organ damage caused by the vaccine that has remained hidden without apparent clinical presentations, mainly in the circulatory system. Therefore, careful risk assessments prior to surgery and invasive medical procedures are essential. Randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm these clinical observations. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nRecently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.\nThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.

This is especially important for older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who are at highest risk for severe illness.\nThe virus is constantly changing, and our immunity, whether from vaccines or previous infections, fades. Getting updated vaccines like the updated COVID-19 vaccines that are available now continues to be important, especially for older people and those with certain medical conditions.\nImmune protection from both vaccines and previous infections can decline over time and as new variants emerge.

After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA.

Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.

These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1].

The team at the small hospital soon realised this was not an isolated case. The virus had long spread outside the city of Wuhan, China, which had been under a strict lockdown for more than a month.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-30\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Italy is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. One week later an Italian man repatriated to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalized and confirmed as the third case in Italy. Clusters of cases were later detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February, with the first deaths on 22 February.\nThe majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters. On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in lockdown. On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and restricted movement of people.\nOn 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak. In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas: The number of new cases and deaths per day in Italy from COVID-19 showing the effects of lockdown and lifting\nThe governor of Basilicata, Vito Bardi, instituted a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people arriving from areas in Northern Italy affected by the outbreak. The Ministry of Health announced that it had engaged 31 laboratories in Italy to carry out the analysis of swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases. Minister Roberto Speranza appointed Walter Ricciardi, a member of World Health Organization's executive committee and former president of Italian National Institute of Health, as a special adviser for relations between Italy and international health organisations.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Italy Coronavirus Map and Case Count - The New York Times\nContent:\nSee the latest charts and maps of coronavirus <strong>cases</strong>, deaths and vaccinations <strong>in</strong> <strong>Italy</strong>.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Italy COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer\nContent:\n<strong>Italy</strong> Coronavirus update with statistics and graphs: total and new <strong>cases</strong>, deaths per <strong>day</strong>, mortality and recovery rates, current active <strong>cases</strong>, recoveries, trends and timeline.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-11-09\nTitle: How covid-19 surprised Italy again - The Washington Post\nContent:\nCrisanti said no country can keep pace with contact tracing when it is seeing 35,000 cases per day, as Italy is now. But Italy could have given itself a better chance to contain the wave if it had built more labs across the country, performing granular surveillance of hot-spot neighborhoods and workplaces, at the first beginning of the uptick. Crisanti said Italy should have been testing 400,000 people per day at the end of the summer when it was instead testing 75,000. The summer heightened the dangers for what Italians call the “rientro” — the post-holiday return to city life.\nHospitals now have more protective gear, more ventilators and more intensive-care capacity than in the spring. But Italy’s breakdown came in an earlier line of defense: Contact tracers increasingly struggled to identify and isolate infected people before the virus spread through communities. ... The contact-tracing system “crumbled as soon as we exceeded 1,000 cases per day,” said Andrea Crisanti, a virologist at the University of Padua who advised the Veneto region in the spring.\nSeveral European scientists, including in Italy, made the case that the virus had weakened, a minority scientific position that nonetheless captured attention with summer hospitalization rates so low. Italy had given itself one of the best chances among European countries to sustainably contain the virus after the spring crisis. Its emergence from the March and April lockdown had been anything but swift or reckless, with new reopenings coming at two-week intervals to gauge their riskiness.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had said in August that the country would be able to deal with any future increases in cases without limits on “economic activity.” · All along, some degree of resurgence was inevitable — especially as the weather cooled and people began to socialize more indoors. But Italian health officials had reasoned that a second wave wouldn’t be nearly as severe as the first. Hospitals were more prepared.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-01, states that the first COVID-19 case in Italy was confirmed on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-12-30, confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 9 March 2020.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, published on 2020-04-22 and without a specific date, provide real-time updates on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-11-09, states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. The article also mentions that hospitals were more prepared for a second wave of the virus, but the contact-tracing system had already crumbled.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true. The pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, which occurred in February and March 2020, as the country struggled to cope with the sudden surge of cases. However, the claim does not mention any specific date or context for the pictures.\n\nThe information published on 2021-02-01 and 2023-12-30 confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020. Therefore, it is possible that the pictures in question were taken during the first wave of the virus in Italy.\n\nHowever, the information published on 2020-11-09 states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. This suggests that the situation in Italy had worsened again by November 2020, and the country was facing a second wave of the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true, it does not provide enough context or evidence to support the claim. The available information suggests that the pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, but it is also possible that they are from a later stage of the pandemic when the country was facing a second wave of the virus. Therefore, the claim cannot be classified as entirely true or false without further information.", "response": "FALSE."}

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports.

Owens' post used the example of people with heart disease. However, individuals with underlying medical conditions are in the higher-risk groups for the coronavirus, as Aiken detailed: As most people are aware, people pre-existing disease like heart failure, and COPD, seem to be at higher risk for death due to COVID-19.\nIf those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory.

Do these two examples, however, prove the claim that the marking of COVID-19 deaths is pervasive and over-inflated?\nDo these two examples, however, prove the claim that the marking of COVID-19 deaths is pervasive and over-inflated? The answer is very likely no. Dr. Cara Christ, the head of the Arizona Department of Health Services told ABC 15 that the attending physician that witnesses a death is responsible for determining the cause of death.\nNot only do most doctors not have a financial incentive to determine causes of death, but there are multiple steps in the medical billing and coding process that are designed to prevent “upcoding” from happening. Dr. Murtaza Akhter is a professor at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, and an Emergency Room physician, who has had to sign several death notes in his line of work. We asked him if upcoding deaths for COVID-19 could occur in Arizona.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Debunking the False Claim That COVID Death Counts Are Inflated ...\nContent:\nNow some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020. This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is “a gross misinterpretation” of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nThat specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says.\nThe 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation most likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.\nEven someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus. The idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false, Anderson says.\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, discusses the importance of tracking all-cause mortality to provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted. It also explains that deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were estimated and comparing these two sets of estimates can provide insight about how many excess deaths are identified as due to COVID-19, and how many excess deaths are reported as due to other causes of death.\n\nInformation 2, published on September 17, 2020, states that overall about one in thirteen deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death, but this proportion has risen substantially to nearly a third over the last eight weeks. It also explains that COVID-19 should be recorded on the medical certificate of cause of death for all decedents where the disease caused or contributed to death, and that if COVID-19 is present on the death certificate as a significant condition contributing to death but not the underlying cause, these deaths \"are not deaths due to COVID-19 and should not be certified as such.\"\n\nInformation 3, published on April 1, 2020, emphasizes that COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.

It also explains that the idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false.\n\nThe claim in question, published on March 29, 2020, states that COVID-19 is not being blamed for deaths due to unrelated causes. Based on the information provided, it is clear that COVID-19 is being listed as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death on death certificates when the disease caused or contributed to death. However, it is also clear that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly. Overall, it is important to note that the attending physician is responsible for determining the cause of death and that there are multiple steps in the medical billing and coding process that are designed to prevent \"upcoding\" from happening.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it is clear that COVID-19 is being listed as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death on death certificates when the disease caused or contributed to death. However, it is also clear that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly. Therefore, the claim that COVID-19 is not being blamed for deaths due to unrelated causes is partially true, but it is important to note that there have been some cases where deaths have been certified as COVID-19 that were probably coded improperly.", "response": "FALSE."}

They were originally developed by Robert Koch, a German physician who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1905 for his work on tuberculosis. The original postulates are as follows:\nIn summary, the article’s claim is false. Monoclonal antibodies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 are available and pathologists use a variety of techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in published studies. “the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates”\nThere are many studies on SARS-CoV-2 that fulfill Koch’s postulates[14-16]. European Society of Pathology: [The following statement was co-signed by ESP President Prof. Holger Moch, ESP Director-General Dr. Raed Al-Dieri, and ESP Secretary Prof. Aurelio Ariza] In response to some of the claims made by the article “No one has died from the coronavirus,” the European Society of Pathology (ESP) offers the following comments:\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-03-04\nTitle: Fact Check-Koch’s postulates do not need to be fulfilled to prove ...\nContent:\nHowever, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here). In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals. This makes it impossible to fulfil this postulate, and by extension, the fourth postulate, in diseases specific to humans (here). Postulate Four: “The microorganism can be transferred from the infected and diseased individuals back into a pure culture.” While not an original postulate of Koch’s (here), this is essentially a repeat of step two using a different source.\nAn article that claims that researchers have not proven that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 uses outdated criteria and presents incomplete facts to make its arguments. The article focuses on how researchers have not fulfilled Koch’s postulates - a 19th-century set of criteria to show a microbe causes a disease - as they were originally understood.\nUpdated criteria for determining viruses that cause disease are sometimes still referred to as Koch’s postulates (here) These involve animals being infected with the suspect virus (here and here) and viruses being grown in cells (here), which would not be considered a “pure culture” as Koch would have understood it (here) and would not fulfil the purification criteria mentioned previously even though other microbes are removed (here). VERDICT False. Koch’s postulates, as they were originally understood, do not need to be demonstrated in order to establish that a microbe causes a disease. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and has been shown to do so by modern standards, including criteria modelled on Koch’s postulates, as well as genetic techniques that were not developed until decades after Koch’s death.\nWhile purposeful infection of humans with disease has been done historically, this is rare due to ethical concerns. However, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here).

AP decries this blatant misuse of its content and mistruths of any kind,” Lauren Easton, Global Director of Media Relations for the Associated Press told AFP by email. ...

The claim is false; the video's audio has been doctored to include a reference to COVID-19; the original Associated Press archive footage does not include any reference to COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-01, is from Reuters and contains a fact-check of a video claiming that Saddam Hussein spoke about the coronavirus in 1990.

The claim is false, and the video's audio has been doctored to include a reference to COVID-19.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that Saddam Hussein spoke about the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\nBased on the information provided, it is clear that the claim that Saddam Hussein spoke about the coronavirus is false. All the information sources agree that the video is a genuine archive video of Saddam Hussein meeting his military advisors, but the audio has been doctored to include a fake audio of Saddam Hussein talking about the coronavirus. The original audio does not contain any mention of the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim is false, and the evidence supports this conclusion.", "response": "FALSE."}

But he defended himself - once again to cheers from worshippers - by saying: \"What I meant was that the virus would be halted where it began, and in Wuhan it has stopped.\" Other pastors have been accused of flying in the face of the authorities and spreading fake news, impeding efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-05-18\nTitle: \"Nigeria does not have Coronavirus.

Vaccine hesitancy in the South African context can be demonstrated since the outbreak of COVID-19 from responses to several online studies, which were conducted to assess vaccine acceptance and hesitancy.8,9 Across all stu\nResults from the University of Johannesburg (UJ)/Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) COVID-19 Democracy Survey, the most comprehensive study to date on this topic, suggest that approximately a third of the adult South African population is hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a proportion that is higher than for most countries globally.9 The most cited reason for a lack of acceptance is concern over vaccine safety followed by a low confidence in the effectiveness of the vaccine.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-05-14\nTitle: Just 12 People Are Behind Most Vaccine Hoaxes On Social Media, ...\nContent:\n\"Getting Americans vaccinated is critical to putting this pandemic behind us.

However, based on Information 1, the photo was taken in Manchester, England, and shows Joan Burgess receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The photo was published in a South African newspaper, Rapport, with a satirical caption poking fun at anti-vaxxers. Therefore, the claim is misleading and false, as the photo was not staged and was used in a satirical context to address vaccine hesitancy.\n\nAdditionally, the CLAIM does not provide any evidence connecting the photo to misleading the public about the coronavirus pandemic. The photo was used in a satirical context to address anti-vaxxers, not to mislead the public.

As suggested in the apt title of a recent paper by Platje et al. (2020), the COVID‐19 pandemic appears to have been “both an expected and unexpected event.” However, many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration's response were not only foreseeable but were, in fact, foreseen.\nTrump, sobered by worst‐case scenario death projections (McGraw & Oprysko, 2020), accepted Fauci and Birx's public health framing that a shutdown was needed to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed and save lives (White House, 2020h). Trump was then persuaded to extend the shutdown for an additional 30 days. In addition to the shutdown, to cope with the economic fallout of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Trump supported, and, on March 27, 2020, signed into law, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) (AJMC, 2021).\nIn the US alone, the horrifying costs of the pandemic can be measured in the millions of Americans infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the many hundreds of thousands confirmed dead with or from COVID‐19 to date (Johns Hopkins University, 2022). While the pandemic came as a rude awakening to many nonspecialists, the predominant view among health security professionals was that the question was not whether but when the next major pandemic or public health emergency would strike. Yet, despite these insights, decades of preparedness work, and considerable investment, President Trump, in March 2020, claimed, “Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\nWarnings were regularly made in the media (e.g., Yong, 2018), by prominent individuals, such as Bill Gates in a widely viewed 2015 TED talk, and by Trump's own experts, who predicted, based on a 2019 influenza simulation, that the US would be underprepared, underfunded, and would be unable to respond effectively to a pandemic. With over 400,000 deaths in the US as a result of COVID‐19, at the time Trump left office, this assessment appears tragically prescient. Multiple studies have concluded that many of the deaths in the US were avoidable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-19\nTitle: AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s virus revisionism; Biden on the hoax | ...\nContent:\nThe institute now forecasts more than 378,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by Jan. 1. In early April, U.S. officials estimated at least 100,000 would die from the pandemic even if all conceivable steps were taken against it — a thorough and enduring lockdown, full use of masks and more. A death toll up to 240,000 assumed aggressive mitigation. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so — a number that puts the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\nFirst and most notably, the U.S. is not running “substantially” below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Tens of thousands of new infections are being reported each day.

TRUMP: “If you look at what we’ve done and all of the lives that we’ve saved … this was our prediction, that if we do a really good job, we’ll be at about a hundred and — 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-13\nTitle: The Two Million Lives President Trump has Saved from COVID-19 | ...\nContent:\nKamala Harris claimed that President Donald Trump is personally responsible for the more than 214,00 Americans who have perished from COVID-19. This is factually wrong, disingenuous, immoral and disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working every day to defeat this virus. It completely ignores the real, successful efforts by the Trump administration to save lives.\nBiden, Harris, Democrats and the media may continue to lie about COVID-19. But in the end, the American people will recognize the lives which have been saved and the real efforts which have been made to save them. The virus has tragically killed 214,000 Americans. President Trump—and the brave men and women in our public health system—have saved 2 million.\nIn fact, Biden already has a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics—his previous tenure as vice president is part of the reason federal agencies were strapped for resources at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In May, his own former chief of staff, Ron Klain, told Politico it was \"purely a fortuity\" that the Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 outbreak didn't turn out to be \"one of the great mass casualty events in American history.\" Klain continued, \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck.\" We don't need to ask Biden how he would have dealt with the current pandemic, because we know how badly he handled the last major viral event.\nIn the first two debates of the 2020 presidential contest, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris claimed that President Donald Trump is personally responsible for the more than 214,00 Americans who have perished from COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: FALSE: Trump called COVID-19 a \"hoax\"; Trump's pandemic response ...\nContent:\nExplanation: Video w/ Trump calling the virus a \"hoax\" was misleadingly edited; Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die; it rather avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario. Read the Full Article (AFP) This false claim originated from: TV advertisements & speeches by candidates · The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed. Remember to check the date when the fact-check you are reading was published before sharing it.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a date, states that President Trump’s decisive action has helped save American lives, with the United States having a lower excess mortality rate than Europe and among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 99.997% of individuals aged 19 and younger who contract coronavirus make a full recovery, 99.98% of those aged 20 to 49 make a full recovery, and 99.5% aged 50 to 69 fully recover.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains that the COVID-19 pandemic was both expected and unexpected, and that many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration’s response were foreseeable and foreseen. Trump was persuaded to extend the shutdown and supported a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill. Despite warnings and preparedness work, Trump claimed in March 2020 that nobody knew there would be a pandemic of this proportion.\n\nInformation 3, published on September 19, 2020, states that the U.S. is not running substantially below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so, putting the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\n\nInformation 4, published on October 13, 2020, claims that President Trump and the brave men and women in the public health system have saved 2 million lives, and that Biden and Harris have a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics.\n\nInformation 5, published on October 30, 2020, states that a video of Trump calling the virus a “hoax” was misleadingly edited, and that Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die. Instead, it avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that Trump called COVID-19 a hoax is false. The claim that Trump’s pandemic response saved 2 million lives is also false, as the information states that the Trump administration has saved lives, but does not provide a specific number. Furthermore, the claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is not supported by the provided information.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim that Trump called COVID-19 a hoax is false, as stated in Information 5, published on October 30, 2020. The AFP fact-check found that a video of Trump calling the virus a “hoax” was misleadingly edited.\n\nThe claim that Trump’s pandemic response saved 2 million lives is also false, as the information provided does not support this claim. Information 4, published on October 13, 2020, states that President Trump and the brave men and women in the public health system have saved 2 million lives, but does not provide evidence to support this claim. Information 5, published on October 30, 2020, states that Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die, but instead avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario.\n\nThe claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is not supported by the provided information. Information 1, published without a date, states that the U.S. has a lower excess mortality rate than Europe, but does not provide information on the mortality rate. Information 3, published on September 19, 2020, states that the U.S. is not running substantially below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19, implying that the U.S. has a higher mortality rate than projected.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Trump called COVID-19 a hoax is false, and the claim that Trump’s pandemic response saved 2 million lives is not supported by the provided information. The claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is also not supported by the provided information.", "response": "FALSE."}

In a new study in the Journal of Public Health, researchers from Queen Mary University of London and other U.K.-based institutions have expressed worry about these evident trends: “There is increasing concern over the higher rate of poor COVID-19 outcomes in BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] populations. Understanding potential drivers of this relationship is urgently needed to inform public health and research efforts.\nSpecialists express “increasing concern” over the fact that people of color and different ethnicities are at a higher risk of poor outcomes if they develop COVID-19. Preexisting diseases, vitamin D levels, or socioeconomic factors do not explain the disparities, they say.\nUntil researchers take an in-depth look at these and other possible underlying factors, outcome disparities for COVID-19 are bound to persist.

There have been increasing calls for research to better capture and report on socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes alongside race/ethnicity to identify populations that may experience a disproportionate burden of risk and/or ability to benefit from pandemic mitigation strategies.(10,13) We observed significant racial/ethnic disparities in ability to social distance as a measure of COVID exposure, susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and access to healthcare in our national cohort.\nMitigation strategies and messaging should intensify focus on Hispanic and Black NH individuals with conditions that increase risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and incorporate targeted, culturally appropriate communication. As with all observational studies, confounding of the exposure-outcome relationship is a concern, and we did not address the possibility of joint effects of the SEP indices.\nWe examined the relationship between each SEP index with COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or seroconversion), and we assessed race/ethnicity as a potential effect measure modifier (EMM) of the relationship between each SEP index and COVID-19 outcome.\nSecond, as the measure of COVID-19 susceptibility, we included conditions or behaviors that CDC has identified as increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications given SARS-CoV-2 infection: aged 60 years or older, daily smoking, and underlying chronic conditions (chronic lung disease, current asthma, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, immunocompromised condition, or HIV positive). Finally, as the measure of healthcare access, we included factors that affect medical care access: no primary care doctor, concerns about the costs of healthcare, concerns about seeing a doctor due to immigration status, or no health care coverage/insurance.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-08-17\nTitle: Racial Disparities in COVID-19: Key Findings from Available Data ...\nContent:\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing focus on its disproportionate impacts on people of color, particularly as availability of data to understand racial disparities has increased. This brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities.\nThis brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities. Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc.

According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

Researchers fed mice infected with the influenza virus a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which resulted in a higher survival rate than compared to those on a normal high-carbohydrate diet. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung and trapped the virus before it became worse.\nDuring the study, the team showed that mice infected with the flu virus that were fed the keto diet had a higher survival rate than mice on a high-carb normal diet. The researchers were more excited to find the details behind this event. The keto diet actually triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not. When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.\nThe two trainees are, Ryan Molony who found that immune system activators called inflammasomes can cause harmful immune system responses in their host, and Emily Goldberg who worked in Dixit's lab, which had shown that the ketogenic diet blocked formation of inflammasomes.

Several widely shared letters by small groups of scientists from different countries pushed strongly in the direction of a natural origin, calling suggestions that COVID-19 emerged in a lab a conspiracy theory.\nChinese officials have consistently rejected not only the hypothesis that the virus originated at the Wuhan laboratory, but that it originated in China at all. Additionally, Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn’t leak from her laboratory. (In April 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health pulled funding for a research project on coronaviruses in which the Wuhan institute was a chief partner.) Meanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States.\nMeanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States. The accusations come amid tensions between Washington and Beijing. Throughout 2020, the Donald Trump administration repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic, adding further friction to a relationship already strained by a trade war and U.S. responses to China’s rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, among other issues.\nMany critics say Trump’s use of inflammatory rhetoric such as “China virus” and “kung flu” contributed to a rise in anti-Asian bias in the United States amid the pandemic. President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts.

Tens of thousands of people have been infected in Singapore, and as of May 8, more than 54,000 were infected in Africa.

To this end, we regress the prevalence of COVID-19 (logarithmically transformed) at the country level against the latitude of a country.\nTo control for key confounders at the country-level, our analysis includes (1) data on air travel16 (to capture a possible way of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across countries but also the remoteness of a place, which might increase the need for air travel); (2) vehicle concentration17 and urbanization16 (to capture differences in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 within a country18); (3) COVID-19 testing intensity19,20 (to control for the vigor of a country’s COVID-19 response and for COVID-19 detection bias in cross-country comparisons21,22); (4) cell phone usage16 (to control for the speed at which information on behavior change for COVID-19 prevention travels within a country18,23); and (5) health expenditure (to capture differences in countries' commitment to population health); old-age dependency ratio (to capture cross-country differences in age structure and family compositions, which can affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2), and income16 (to control for differences in economi\nWHO’s warning that the virus spreads in all climates must still be taken seriously. At the time of revising this manuscript in January 2021, many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by an easier spread of COVID-19 in winter.\nIn sum, we show that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the threat of epidemic resurgence may increase during winter. However, our results do not indicate that the disease will vanish in summer, nor that countries located close to the equator will contain the disease without effective public health measures.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-24\nTitle: Will Heat Kill the COVID-19 Spread This Summer?\nContent:\nCan Coronavirus survive the heat? Could warm weather stop COVID-19 from circulating? Find out if the weather and heat can reduce or possibly end the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-31, is a fact-check by Poynter that debunks the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries. The claim originated from an anonymous letter stating that the virus can be fought off by eating chillies and ginger and can be destroyed at temperatures of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2018-01-25, explains that cold weather does not directly make people sick, and the misconception may come from the fact that people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other when it's cold, which can facilitate the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-11, states that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive and spread in warm climates, citing Singapore and Africa as examples where the virus has spread despite warm temperatures.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a study that examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for several confounding factors. The study found that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-24, discusses whether heat can kill the COVID-19 spread, but it does not provide a definitive answer.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries is false. The virus can survive and spread in warm climates, as evidenced by outbreaks in countries such as Singapore and Africa. Additionally, a study found that an increase in absolute latitude is associated with a higher number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates. Therefore, it is important to take WHO's warning that the virus spreads in all climates seriously and continue to follow public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.", "response": "FALSE."}

While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies. However, the abstract does not provide any details about the study or its findings.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2021, reports on a study conducted by researchers at Kansas State University and the Agricultural Research Service. The study found that house flies can acquire and harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 hours after exposure.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2020, is a fact-check debunking a misleading video claiming that flies can spread the coronavirus if they come into contact with infected human faeces. The fact-check confirms that this claim is false.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that experts in China found that the coronavirus can be spread through houseflies. However, the information available does not support this claim. Information 1, 3, and 5 contradict the claim, stating that while houseflies can carry the virus, there is no evidence to suggest they can transmit it. Information 2 is a fact-check that debunks the claim, and Information 4, published after the claim, reports on a study showing that houseflies can carry the virus for up to 24 hours but does not provide evidence of transmission.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, as there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that houseflies can spread the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

On March 13, one Facebook post with more than 150 shares explained the test, “Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no (COVID-19 caused) Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.”\nThe March 13 post claimed the breath test checked for fibrosis caused by COVID-19. The post read, “By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late.”\nSocial media posts claim holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19.

Since returning to the stage in June, the Foo Fighters have played a handful of concerts and festival sets all over the country, often being the first band to “re-open” a venue as they did with New York City’s Madison Square Garden or Albuquerque, New Mexico’s Isleta Amphiteater. Of the latter show, Grohl said, “[I]t was the first time they’d had a show there in 688 days.\nStill, Grohl said it was a great relief to be back on stage again — so much so that he noted he wouldn’t mind doing the kind of treks the Foo Fighters embarked on in their early days. “We’ve circled back to a place where we started years ago — that energy still feels new,” he said. “I don’t think anyone at this point would have any complaints about touring like we did in 1995, which was like two-and-a-half months on the road and then a week off. Everyone’s just kinda fucking dying for it right now.” · Accompanying Grohl’s interview with NME was the announcement of a run of U.K. stadium shows, which are set to take place in June and July 2022.\nGrohl went on to say how the Foo Fighters have been doing their best to keep both themselves and their fans safe, following whatever guidelines are in place, from the federal level down to state and local protocols.

In July, 239 scientists signed an open letter appealing to the medical community and governing bodies to recognize the potential risk of airborne transmission. That same month (by coincidence, not as a result of the letter), WHO released a new scientific brief on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that stated:\nOver a year since declaring Covid-19 a pandemic, the World Health Organization has finally admitted that Coronavirus is airborne. Aerosol researchers started warning that \"the world should face the reality\" of airborne transmission in April 2020. Then in June, some claimed that it was \"the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19\".\nMany people think Trump was trying to shift the blame for his poor handling of the pandemic to a scapegoat, criticizing WHO for \"severely mismanaging and covering up\" the spread of Covid-19 and mistakes that \"pushed China's misinformation.\" Others believe that blaming WHO is not scapegoating because there's some merit to Trump's criticism.\nWHO failed to consider that practical advice — to recommend that the public use caution and wear face masks to block airborne droplets — has no major downsides when compared to the alternative, which is to potentially allow people to spread Covid.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-07-09\nTitle: Modes of transmission of virus causing COVID-19: implications for ...\nContent:\nRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7\nAs evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play in transmission.  · Based on the available evidence, including the recent publications mentioned above, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. WHO continues to recommend airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures and support treatment are performed, according to risk assessment.13 These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine14 and those currently used in Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom.15-17\nAt the same time, other countries and organizations, including the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients, and consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3).18-19\nTransmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).  · Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-04-29\nTitle: A guideline to limit indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19\nContent:\nAirborne transmission was also implicated in the COVID-19 outbreak between residents of a Korean high-rise building whose apartments were linked via air ducts (30). Studies have also confirmed the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in respiratory aerosols (31) suspended in air samples collected at distances as large as 16 ft from infected patients in a hospital room (3). Further evidence for the dominance of indoor airborne transmission has come from an analysis of 7,324 early cases outside the Hubei Province, in 320 cities across mainland China (32).\nNext, we illustrate the value of our guideline in contact tracing (82), specifically, in prescribing the scope of the testing of people with whom an infected index case has had close contact. The CDC presently defines a COVID-19 “close contact” as any encounter in which an individual is within 6 ft of an infected person for more than 15 min. Fig. 3 makes clear that this definition may grossly underestimate the number of individuals exposed to a substantial risk of airborne infection in indoor spaces.\nAirborne transmission arises through the inhalation of aerosol droplets exhaled by an infected person and is now thought to be the primary transmission route of COVID-19. By assuming that the respiratory droplets are mixed uniformly through an indoor space, we derive a simple safety guideline for mitigating airborne transmission that would impose an upper bound on the product of the number of occupants and their time spent in a room.\nThe importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-16\nTitle: 10 reasons why the coronavirus is airborne: Study | Mint\nContent:\nThe team highlighted research estimating that silent (asymptomatic or presymptomatic) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission.

The researchers also cited work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels; people who were never in each other's presence.\nColorado: According to a new assessment published today in the medical journal Lancet there is consistent, strong evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is predominantly transmitted through the air. Therefore, public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread, according to six experts from the UK, USA and Canada, including Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado Boulder.\nThe team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trish Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-04-21\nTitle: 10 Signs Airborne Coronavirus Spread is What Matters\nContent:\nIn February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It's likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn't know it.\nWith COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease.\nSome children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.\nDoctors and health officials use this term when they don't know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 9, 2021, discusses the World Health Organization (WHO) finally acknowledging the airborne transmission of COVID-19.

In most cases, children recover from long COVID within a few months. But for some children, it can take a long time to feel better. During this time, it’s important that parents keep an eye on their child’s mental health.\nCountless children in South Asia have lost loved ones and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. And if children have never been exposed to death before, facing loss for the first time can be as confusing as it is upsetting.

Unfortunately, the pandemic also presented new challenges for children.\nThirty per cent of children became less physically active during this period, missing out on the health benefits of activities such as cycling, playing football or running around in the park.  · In addition, during the lockdown period over 35% of children spent more time watching television, playing video games or using social media, increasing their sedentary time, thus putting themselves at greater risk of becoming overweight and obese, and increasing their exposure to marketing of unhealthy products via digital media.\nThese data provide invaluable insights into the consequences – both good and bad – of the pandemic and the effects it had on children. This is one of the largest studies of its kind, and the lessons learned can help countries to plan for future emergencies and pandemics. “The lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of implementing effective policies to improve food environments, encourage physical activity, and protect the health and well-being of families.\nLockdowns, restrictions, and emergency policies have changed our diets, physical activity patterns and many other daily habits that are tightly connected to our well-being.

There was no such adjustment. Florida has become a focal point in the nation’s struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19.

What international law says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and “are particularly protective of civilian hospitals”, according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.\nArticle 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including “intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected”.\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are “military objectives”. Philip-Gay said that “if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used”, the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.\nOne: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque – those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-02\nTitle: What are the laws of war when a hospital is a war zone? | The Hill\nContent:\nAll wars are an effrontery to health, and the Israel-Hamas war is no exception. Caring for the wounded is a necessary part of waging war and hospitals are protected from the consequence of hostilities. Additionally, all medical personnel are considered non-combatants.\nAccording to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals can never be a military target. That hospitals should not be a military target seems uncontroversial, but a deeper question remains: when is a building a hospital and when is it not?\nHumanitarian law is pragmatic, however, and has an answer when attacks are launched from places assumed to be protected. A building ceases to be a hospital when it is used as a base to launch rockets. Under these circumstances, a building is transformed from “hospital” to “legitimate military target.” The distinctive emblem designating non-combatant status is the red cross, the reverse colors of the Swiss flag; launching only one rocket from the hospital parking lot is enough to change the meaning of a red cross on that building from “hospital” to “bullseye.”\nIf a decision is made to attack a hospital, international humanitarian law requires advanced warning to that hospital. If the hospital fails to heed the warning, the subsequent attack on that hospital must adhere to the principles of precaution and proportionality.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: Can Hospitals Be Military Targets?

Philip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target.\nPhilip-Gay said that \"if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used\", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. But \"the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians\", she said. Even if the hospital is used for \"acts harmful to the enemy\", Philip-Gay said, the other party \"does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it\", citing the need under international law for the response to be \"proportionate\".\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: The protection of hospitals during armed conflicts: What the law ...\nContent:\nAccording to international humanitarian law (IHL), health establishments and units, including hospitals, should not be attacked. This protection extends to the wounded and sick as well as to medical staff and means of transport. The rule has few exceptions.\nThe protection provided to the wounded and sick would have little meaning if medical personnel, medical units and establishments (such as hospitals), and medical means of transport were subject to attack. Therefore, IHL extends specific protections to them; parties to a conflict must respect them while they are performing an exclusively medical function, and must not unduly interfere with their work so as to allow them to treat the wounded and sick.\nSpecific protection of medical establishments and units (including hospitals) is the general rule under IHL. Therefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\".\nTherefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\". In case of doubt as to whether medical units of establishments are used to commit an \"act harmful to the enemy\", they should be presumed not to be so used.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (no publication date): Customary IHL states that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law unless they lose their protective status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. If there is doubt about a hospital's status, it should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 2 (published 2023-11-17): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, if there is doubt, the hospital should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 3 (published 2023-11-02): Hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be a military target. However, if a hospital is used to launch rockets, it becomes a legitimate military target. Advanced warning must be given before attacking a hospital, and the attack must follow the principles of precaution and proportionality.\n\nInformation 4 (published 2023-11-16): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians, and the response must be proportionate.\n\nInformation 5 (published 2023-11-16): According to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals should not be attacked, and medical personnel, medical units, and means of transport should be respected. The protection of hospitals can only cease if they are used for harmful acts against the enemy, and in case of doubt, hospitals should be presumed not to be used for such acts.\n\nClaim Summary: An official decree was taken by the government stating that the military will have to help in hospitals.\n\nGiven the information available, the claim does not provide enough context to determine if it is true or false. However, the information provided does support the idea that hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be attacked unless they lose their protected status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. Therefore, if the government decree states that the military will be helping in hospitals, it is likely that the hospitals have not lost their protected status and are still considered protected civilian facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %). Countries with high values in spring 2020 recorded high excess mortality rates again in November 2020: Belgium (58.8 %), Italy (51.6 %), Austria (47.3 %), Malta (40.2 %), France (31.3 %) and Spain (24.4 %).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A ...\nContent:\nFrance’s deaths began around mid-March but the rate was slower than for Italy and Spain.

In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown.

Deaths in long-term care facilities accounted for more than a third of all Covid-19 deaths in the United States for much of the pandemic — at one point, rising to about 43 percent of all coronavirus deaths — but this number has declined since the vaccination rollout began.\nCovid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to adults in their 60s and older who have underlying health conditions. And it can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room. While 4 percent of the country’s cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for about 31 percent of the country’s pandemic fatalities.\n*In New York, the case count is often the same as the death count because the state only reports the number of people who have died but not the number of overall infections.·States with insufficient data to calculate a share of Covid-19 deaths are shaded gray. The share of deaths linked to long-term care facilities for older adults is even starker at the state level. In 5 states, the number of residents and workers who have died accounts for either half or more than half of all deaths from the virus.

AARP continues to urge elected officials to take action to combat this national tragedy, make sure it does not happen again, and ensure that public funds provided to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are used for testing, PPE, staffing, virtual visits, and for the health and safety of residents.\nWhile high primary vaccination rates for residents and staff have given us hope, and have saved many lives, there remain many nursing home residents who are not vaccinated at all, and more than half are not up to date on COVID-19 boosters. Residents and staff who are not up to date are more susceptible to adverse outcomes from COVID-19 exposure, and staff who are not up to date could place residents at unnecessary risk.\nAll nursing home data are from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File (downloaded most recently on 9/1/2023).

Based on long-term care usage and demographics in the states, including Missouri, we also estimate nationally that the share of fatalities from nursing home and residential care facilities is 38 percent, and 41 percent outside of New York State.\nThese figures are lower than our analysis released in late July, when nursing or residential care home resident peaked at 45% of all COVID-19 deaths. As states have prioritized protecting such residents, mortality rates within facilities have decreased relative to the rest of the population. Our calculations are available in an online spreadsheet for public review. We estimate the national share of nursing and residential care home COVID-19 fatalities in three ways:\nThe U.S. is not an outlier in terms of its nursing home-related COVID-19 fatalities. A study by researchers at the International Long Term Care Policy Network of fatalities in a range of high-income countries found that 46 percent of reported COVID-19 fatalities took place in nursing homes.\nThe policy implications of these figures are significant, and suggest substantial flaws in the way that we have managed the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more attention must be paid to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes, especially through nursing home staff who work at multiple facilities. Nursing homes must use best practices for testing and cleanliness.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* According to the New York Times, nursing homes accounted for 20% of COVID-19-related deaths in New York as of the end of October 2020, not 70%.

It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\". So what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter? It's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\nIt's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market.\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-21\nTitle: Fact check: Did coronavirus originate in a Chinese laboratory?\nContent:\nWe have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\" We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.\nOne of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China. Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab · More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say · The article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”\nThese sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.\nThis is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs.

Additionally, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus is synthetic and was created in a Chinese laboratory is not supported by the available information. The WHO has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created. Furthermore, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nWhile there is debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China, the consensus among scientific experts is that the virus has an animal origin. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade, and the lab is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that the virus escaped from the WIV.\n\nIt is important to note that the publication date of the claim is 2020-04-13, while the publication date of Information 3 is 2021-05-27. Therefore, the claim was made before the re-emergence of the Wuhan lab-leak theory in 2023.

I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections.

Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

A document from the department shows that 90 % of the stockpile’s PPE has been distributed. The remaining 10% will be kept in reserve for federal efforts, the news service said. “Now that the national stockpile has been depleted of critical equipment, it appears that the administration is leaving states to fend for themselves, to scour the open market for these scarce supplies, and to compete with each other and federal agencies in a chaotic, free-for-all bidding war,” Rep.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Trump’s Strategic National Stockpile looks empty amid ventilator, ...\nContent:\nPart of this new definition of the Strategic National Stockpile does reside in the general vicinity of reality. The stockpile is running low. The Trump administration admits it. And no, this is not the states’ fault. But it’s not entirely clear what will happen when it’s emptied out.\nThe Strategic National Stockpile, like the nuclear arsenal, is something government officials hoped they would never need to use. Formed in 1999 as anxiety over Y2K mounted, this federal stockpile was designed to prevent an interruption to hospital supply chains, if all the computers ended up melting down on New Year’s Eve. That never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security.\nThat never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security. If a bioweapon struck an American city, for example, officials could quickly access vaccines and antitoxins to fight back against nerve agents or diseases like smallpox.\nSince then, the office of the Strategic National Stockpile has been preparing for the next outbreak, though no one knew when or what it would be. With an annual budget of about $600 million, the stockpile has maintained a large supply of personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, face shields, and surgical gowns, as well as medical equipment like the ventilators that hospitals so urgently need now to treat Covid-19 patients.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-06\nTitle: Depleted National Stockpile Contributed to COVID PPE Shortage: ‘You\nContent:\nWhen asked why the SNS didn’t receive appropriations for fully replacing the stockpile following H1N1, he says: “You’d really have to ask the Congress.” · As the documentary finds, sources both inside and outside the government had raised alarms, pre-COVID, about leaving the nation and its front-line health care workers without a PPE safety net.\nOver seven months of interviewing manufacturers and government officials, analyzing records and tracking key medical supplies, AP investigative reporters Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza, along with producer Peter Klein of the Global Reporting Centre and his team, found missed opportunities to prevent that failure stretching across several presidential administrations — including chances to invest in domestic manufacturing rather than relying on supplies made in China, as well as neglecting to substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. Intended as a fallback for covering medical-equipment needs in times of crises, the SNS is a set of government-run warehouses filled with medical supplies, such as ventilators and N95 respirator masks. The Obama administration distributed those supplies on a mass scale during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. “During H1N1, we sent out personal protective equipment that we had stocked for a pandemic influenza event, ahead of a great deal o\n\"America’s Medical Supply Crisis,\" a new documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Global Reporting Centre, examines missed opportunities to fend off a deadly PPE shortage.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-02\nTitle: Coronavirus: Protective gear in national stockpile is nearly ...\nContent:\nHe also said large amounts of PPE were being shipped directly from manufacturers to hospitals. But the DHS officials said the stockpile has not been able to handle the load. President Trump said on March 28 that the United States will “absolutely” have enough ventilators in wake of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the shortage.\nThe government has long viewed the national stockpile supplies as a holdover during an emergency so the government could buy time for manufacturers to boost output and for new supply chains to solidify, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.\nAs coronavirus hot spots flare from coast to coast, the demand for safety equipment — also known as personal protective equipment (PPE) — is both immediate and widespread, with health officials, hospital executives and governors saying that their shortages are critical and that health-care workers are putting their lives at risk while trying to help the surging number of patients. Two DHS officials said the stores kept in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Strategic National Stockpile are nearly gone.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-23, discusses the issues with PPE production and how the US is unable to meet its goals of filling the Strategic National Stockpile. The production of nitrile gloves, the industry standard for protection, is almost exclusively sourced from Asia, leading to a global shortage.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-10, reveals that the Strategic National Stockpile is running low on PPE, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, gowns, and other medical supplies. The stockpile has distributed 90% of its PPE, and the remaining 10% is reserved for federal efforts.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-07, provides background on the Strategic National Stockpile, which was formed in 1999 to prevent interruptions to hospital supply chains during crises. The stockpile has maintained a large supply of personal protective equipment and medical equipment like ventilators.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-10-06, highlights missed opportunities to prevent the PPE shortage, including chances to invest in domestic manufacturing and substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile following the H1N1 pandemic.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-04-02, states that the national stockpile stores are nearly depleted, and the demand for PPE is both immediate and widespread.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-10, states that the National Stockpile is almost out of PPE. This claim is supported by Information 2, also published on 2020-04-10, which reveals that the Strategic National Stockpile has distributed 90% of its PPE and is sending out all its remaining inventory.

It highlights that the PPP supported 75% of smaller businesses with as few as seven people.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-18, mentions that the Main Street Lending Program (MSLP) was finally getting off the ground, but it does not contradict the previous information about the PPP supporting smaller businesses.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2023-12-28, is about the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is not relevant to the CARES Act or the claim in question.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that \"Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street\" is false, as shown by the information published between 2020-05-05 and 2020-06-18. The CARES Act did include provisions to support smaller businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This information is consistent across multiple sources, including Politifact, Poynter, and WRAL.com. The claim ignores the fact that the CARES Act provided support for smaller businesses, which is a significant aspect of the legislation.", "response": "FALSE."}

Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve.

These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4).

Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ...

The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading.

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has shined a concerning light on the the physical and mental health of health care workers – and their lack of sleep.\nI am an expert in sleep and stress among middle-aged adults in the workplace, and my research has found that work-related stress influences sleep quantity and quality. And not only that – poor sleep may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for both health care workers and their patients.\nHealth care workers face many stressors, and many studies have shown that sleep plays a major role. For example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\nFor example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night. My research, which focuses on nurses and direct-care workers, such as nursing assistants, personal care aides, and home health aides, has had similar findings.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Sleep Disturbances in Frontline Health Care Workers During the ...\nContent:\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are sharing their challenges, including sleep disturbances, on social media; however, no study has evaluated sleep in predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media.\nA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Sleep disorders, particularly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), affect a significant number of healthcare workers (HCWs). These sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, daytime drowsiness, and sleep deprivation, which can impair work productivity, lead to occupational accidents and errors, and negatively impact patient care. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA, and 40.9% of HCWs reported at least one type of sleep disorder.\n2. A study published in 2021 found that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression, 50% more likely to report psychological distress, and 70% more likely to report anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened sleep patterns and mental health issues among HCWs due to increased stress and workload.\n3. Insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impairments in maintaining focus. These effects can have severe consequences in patient care.\n4. Health care workers face significant work-related stress, which can negatively impact sleep quantity and quality. A 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\n5. A study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that nearly all frontline HCWs reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim \"Sleep Troubles Hit Health Care Workers\" is TRUE. The detailed information from various sources highlights the significant sleep disorders and sleep disturbances among healthcare workers, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sleep issues can negatively impact work productivity, patient care, and mental health, emphasizing the need for sleep interventions and support for frontline healthcare workers.", "response": "TRUE."}

Special consideration could be given to high-risk waitlisted patients (ie, those with high Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores, risk of decompensation, or liver tumor progression). In addition, a reduction in organ recovery is expected because of COVID-19–related limitations on institutional resources and the evolving understanding of the risk of donor-derived disease transmission.\nEmerging data do suggest that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19. It is not clear whether the risk is specific to NAFLD or to coexisting metabolic risk factors such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are associated with COVID-19 severity. ...

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), named by the International Classification Committee of viruses, has brought new health threats and challenges to the world. In March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by WHO.\nOn the contrary, the position statement in EASL-ESCMID recommended [43] that the dose of immunosuppressant drugs can be adjusted according to antiviral treatment regimens, because it is likely that the drugs in both regimens will interact with each other. During the pandemic, for patients undergoing liver transplantation, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected to prevent infection. In conclusion, in COVID-19 disease, elevated liver enzymes are usually mild and generally recover without treatment.\n(5) In patients with autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplantation, patients with elevated COVID-19 activity and liver biochemical reactions should not be considered to have sudden onset of disease or acute cellular rejection without biopsy confirmation. (6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed.\n(6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed.

Knowing that COVID-19 is easily spread by individuals in close proximity, Chong and his team developed a method that helps them identify the most crowded areas with hustle and bustle, such as a city center, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people.\nUnlike contact tracing applications that are often difficult to deploy and require widespread adoption, his approach protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users. “Our method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps,” Chong said. “All we have to do is perform the measurements using anonymous data that is already being collected for other reasons. We are not tracking individuals.” · As the nation steps up efforts to plan for future outbreaks, Chong said their technique has applications beyond COVID-19. “It can help with other epidemiological risks, such as the flu.\nIn the fight against COVID-19, researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading the disease.

Crowded regions with actively moving people (called at-risk regions) are susceptible to spreading the disease, especially if they contain asymptomatic infected people together with healthy people.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 4, and 5 all discuss a study conducted by researchers at Colorado State University, led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Edwin Chong. The researchers developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy is detailed in a paper published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020 (Alsaeedy & Chong, 2020).

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19.

The United States lost 675,000 people to the Spanish flu in 1918-more casualties than World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined. Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I. Estimates of the number of deaths from the pandemic range from 21 million to 50 million worldwide.

Yet, direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, according to one scientist.\n“We’re talking about young individuals who were in a congregate setting at a time when vaccination overall was not that prevalent,” he says. “We didn’t fully know about disease spread as much. We knew about hygiene but didn’t understand that with a highly transmissible virus, basic sanitation measures such as hand washing weren’t going to cover you.” · Had certain conditions that occurred during the 1918 flu pandemic been replicated a century later, Srivastava suggests, we might have seen a greater impact of COVID-19 on young adults.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-03, states that the 1918 flu pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, killed more than 50 million people worldwide.

In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nSome people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells.\nThe loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different—even sometimes unpleasant or foul—than people remember prior to being infected.\nThis can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Permanent Nerve Damage for Some COVID-19 Survivors\nContent:\nMany COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.

This is similar to the claim, but it doesn't mention if the damage is permanent.\n\nInformation 2, from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explains that COVID-19 symptoms are a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection, and this response can damage body systems. It also mentions that some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, which can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. This information suggests that the damage to nerve cells is not necessarily permanent.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2013, discusses COVID-19 complications that may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This can kill tissue and damage organs, and in some cases, lung transplants have been needed. This information is not directly related to nerve damage.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 are not relevant as they do not contain any information related to the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems that some COVID-19 survivors may experience nerve damage due to infection-triggered immune dysfunction. However, this damage is potentially treatable and may not be permanent, as the nerve cells can repair themselves or be replaced by new cells. Therefore, the claim \"Permanent Nerve Damage for Some COVID-19 Survivors\" needs to be clarified to specify that the nerve damage may not be permanent.", "response": "TRUE."}

The officer had pulled her over for a random breath test and then ticketed her for a licence infringement.

Judge Clive Jeffreys overturned the conviction in June 2011, citing what he thought were differences between the signature on her license and that on the complaint.\nIn July 2015, Cameroon's Far North Region banned Islamic face veils, including the burqa, after two female suicide bombers dressed in Islamic garments detonated themselves in Fotokol, killing 13. The ban is now active in five of the country's ten regions. In June 2015, the full face veil was banned in Chad after veiled Boko Haram members disguised as women committed multiple suicide bombings in N'Djamena.\nThe government distributed letters to businesses on 9 January 2017 declaring a ban on the sale, production and importation of burqas.

No, that's not true: Lenard \"Lenny\" Wells had an illustrious career in law enforcement, serving decades with the Milwaukee Police Department in Wisconsin before later, after retirement, working as a crimininal justice instructor at the University of Memphis in Tennessee.

The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop in February and March. In late March and April, COVID-19 clusters were detected at multiple migrant worker dormitories, which soon contributed to an overwhelming proportion of new cases in the country.\nWith the relaxation of most countermeasures on 26 April 2022, both systems were phased out except in the case of large events with 500 participants, food and beverages outlets, and nightlife entertainment establishments with dancing facilities. On 9 February 2023, it was announced that the use of TraceTogether and SafeEntry would be discontinued from 13 February. A mass vaccination programme is currently under way following the approval and acquisition of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines; in late 2021, Singapore became the world's most-vaccinated country, with more than 85% of its total population fully-vaccinated.\nContact tracing measures SafeEntry and TraceTogether were implemented to identify and quarantine close contacts of positive cases. The last record of COVID-19 cases was on 4 June 2023, which was at 2,481,404 confirmed cases, 2,456,295 recoveries and 1,727 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 0.08%, one of the lowest in the world.\nOn 23 April 2021 in a cabinet reshuffle, Lee announced the appointment of Ong Ye Kung as the new Minister for Health, who would serve in the committee as co-chair alongside the other incumbents. Singapore had also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts against COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-01-31, is a news article that denies the claim of Singapore closing a subway station due to a case of novel coronavirus.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ...

The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%.

U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths.

They also had gathered data from primates and mice. In February, they began diving into these data. “We started to look at cells from tissues such as the lining of the nasal cavity, the lungs, and gut, based on reported symptoms and where the virus has been detected,” says Ordovas-Montanes.\nInterferon actually turned on the ACE2 gene at higher levels, potentially giving the virus new portals to get in. Is interferon alpha — normally a defense — helping SARS-CoV-2 infect cells? (Nevit Dilmen/Wikimedia Commons) “ACE2 is also critical in protecting people during various types of lung injury,” notes Ordovas-Montanes. “When ACE2 comes up, that’s usually a productive response. But since the virus uses ACE2 as a target, we speculate that it might be exploiting that normal protective response.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-20\nTitle: Key nose cells identified as likely COVID-19 virus entry points ...\nContent:\nSign up for our free email newsletter. ... Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease. It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins. The study also predicts how a key entry protein is regulated with other immune system genes and reveals potential targets for the development of treatments to reduce transmission.

Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free. We discuss this issue in Section 7.2.

The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’\" But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020).

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years.\nThe estimates presented may be an early indication of excess mortality related to COVID-19, but should be interpreted with caution, until confirmed by other data sources such as state or local health departments. It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data.\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.\nAs some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted. Additionally, deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were also estimated.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-02-11\nTitle: COVID-19 Data Review: Update on COVID-19–Related Mortality | CDC\nContent:\nAs of November 9, 2022, 1,070,947 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the United States.1 In the first two years of the pandemic, COVID-19 was identified as the third leading cause of death in the United States, trailing only heart disease and cancer.2, 3 Provisional mortality data indicate that, despite a lower number of COVID-19–related deaths reported to date in 2022, COVID-19 remains the third leading cause of death in the United States.3 · Several factors have led to changing patterns of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality over the course of the pandemic, including the introduction and widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, high population prevalence of infection-induced immunity, increased availability of effective COVID-19 outpatient treatment, and changes in the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.\nFrom January to April 2022, age-standardized COVID-19–related mortality rates decreased for all racial and ethnic groups. The risk of in-hospital death for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 declined among all adult age groups.

The fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode.\nIf you're carrying alcohol-based hand sanitizer wherever you go, congratulations—it's what we've been advised to do by public-health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic. However, don't leave it inside your car, because the very alcohol that helps kill germs is also very flammable.\nThe fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode. Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid \"which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-05-28\nTitle: Can hand sanitiser catch fire in a hot car? - Full Fact\nContent:\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363°C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side. So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.

A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases. The article mentions that the Nipah virus is not as easily transmitted as other viruses, but it has a high mortality rate of 70%. It also highlights the potential risk of a new strain emerging that could be more transmissible between humans, potentially causing a devastating pandemic.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, provides an overview of past Nipah virus outbreaks and the containment strategies used in India. It highlights the 2019 outbreak in Kerala and the proactive approach taken by the state government to monitor and isolate potential cases.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-06-23, is a fact-checking article debunking the claim that the WHO had alerted about a new outbreak of the Nipah virus. The article clarifies that the WHO did not compare the Nipah virus to the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 4, with no specific publication date, discusses the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India. The article highlights the rapid response and containment measures taken by the Indian authorities to control the outbreak.\n\nInformation 5 provides a general overview of the Nipah virus, its origins, transmission, and the potential for causing a global pandemic.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-06-23, states that the WHO had alerted about a new outbreak of the Nipah virus, which is more lethal than the novel coronavirus. However, Information 3, published on the same date, contradicts this claim by debunking the rumor and clarifying that the WHO did not make such a comparison.\n\nGiven the sequential relationship between the claim and the available information, the claim is considered FALSE based on the information provided in Information 3.

BBC Future looks at whether there is any evidence to support one particularly common claim. A hot drink can offer comfort, especially on a chilly day. It can act as a salve for a troubled mind, and can make us feel closer to other people. It can even help us cool down in hot weather. But while many people might seek out a cup of coffee, a mug of tea or a hot toddie to help them in these difficult times, one thing a hot drink won’t do is protect you from Covid-19.\nThe hot drink does not, however, get rid of the virus causing the infection in the first place.

The most relevant information is from 1978 (Information 1), which discusses Santiago Carrillo and the Spanish Communist Party but does not mention the government or any branding as communist.\n\nConsidering the time difference between the claim and the most relevant information, it is unlikely that The New York Times would have branded the Government of Spain as communist in 2020, as Spain has been a democratic country since 1978 (Information 1) and the political ideology of the government would not likely shift dramatically in just a few decades.\n\nTherefore, the claim is more likely to be FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ...

Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The Climate Crisis – A Race We Can Win | United Nations\nContent:\nAccording to a September 2019 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report, we are at least one degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and close to what scientists warn would be “an unacceptable risk”. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement. Climate is a risk multiplier that makes worse already existing challenges.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Our planet is warming.

Combatting the coronavirus pandemic required each one of us to do our part, change our habits and daily routines and make personal sacrifices. If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change. Though invisible, COVID-19 has been seen by most people as a “clear and present danger” to the entire world population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-18, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that warmer climates would protect us from the coronavirus.

Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser.\nIrradiation of neurons leads to an elevated temperature local to the targeted cells, which transiently changes the membrane excitability. Opposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5]. Extended exposure to high-intensity infrared light can dramatically increase local temperature and cause tissue damage [10]. Limited exposure leads to less heat generation and generally reversible effects on neuronal activities.\nOpposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5]. Extended exposure to high-intensity infrared light can dramatically increase local temperature and cause tissue damage [10].

There would have been approximately 80% fewer COVID-19 deaths in the United States by March 29, 2020, if the country had employed mandatory BCG vaccination since at least 2000, according to the new research.\nIn their analysis, the scientists also tried to account for other factors that could have affected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections. We investigated whether a previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical progression of COVID-19 A case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil.\nA case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil. Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nOur analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19. One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).
