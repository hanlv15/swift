Vaccines play a critical role in preventing deaths, hospitalisation caused by infectious diseases. Emerging data on effectiveness indicates that licenced COVID-19vaccines are contributing to controlling the spread of the disease.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-27, talks about false Facebook posts circulating during the COVID-19 pandemic. These posts, shared in at least three countries, claim to provide advice on how to legally decline a vaccine. The information mentions that such claims are false and vaccination is not compulsory in most Australian states and Canadian provinces, while exemptions can be obtained in the United States as well as Canada's Ontario and New Brunswick.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-22, is an earlier publication with a similar content. It explains that the series of advice on refusing vaccines is circulating as scientists around the world rush to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. It also mentions that at least two Facebook posts with identical wording, shared in the United States, Canada and Australia, claim to provide advice on “how to legally decline a vaccine.”\n\nInformation 3, published on 2021-05-14, discusses a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate which identified 12 people responsible for the bulk of misleading claims about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. Facebook has taken action against some of these figures, removing or restricting accounts that repeatedly share debunked claims.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a survey of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 23 countries in 2022. The survey found that willingness to accept vaccination was at 79.1%, up 5.2% from June 2021.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-05-17, is a statement for healthcare professionals about how COVID-19 vaccines work. It emphasizes the critical role of vaccines in preventing deaths and hospitalizations caused by infectious diseases.\n\nClaim Evaluation:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-22, states that Facebook posts shared in at least three countries claim to offer a legal way to refuse vaccination. According to Information 1 and 2, these claims are indeed false. Vaccination is not compulsory in most Australian states and Canadian provinces, while exemptions can be obtained in the United States as well as Canada's Ontario and New Brunswick. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate in terms of the posts circulating, but it fails to mention that the advice being shared is false.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-04-22, which is earlier than Information 1 and 2. However, the claim does not provide any fact-checking or debunking of the information being shared in the Facebook posts. Information 1 and 2, published later, clarify that the advice being shared in the posts is false. Therefore, while the claim correctly identifies the circulation of the posts, it does not provide the full context, making it partially accurate.\n\nEvidence:\n\nInformation 1 and 2, published on 2020-04-27 and 2020-04-22 respectively, state that the claims made in the Facebook posts are false. These posts, shared in at least three countries, claim to provide advice on how to legally decline a vaccine, even though vaccination is not compulsory in most Australian states and Canadian provinces, and exemptions can be obtained in the United States as well as Canada's Ontario and New Brunswick.", "response": "FALSE."}

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.

The UK Department of Health and Social Care clarified that Johnson was referring to a UK government report, which analyzed the most effective method to test people entering the UK with a Covid-19 PCR test. The report found that only testing people once on arrival in the UK had a 7% success rate, while testing people a second time between the 5th and 10th day of their home quarantine identified Covid-19 infections in between 85% to 98% of cases.\n\nInformation 2 and 3, published on 2020-03-27, report that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild symptoms.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-28, is a statement by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, where he outlines the second test for easing lockdown measures, which is a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from Covid-19.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2023-11-20, is a report on testimony given by Patrick Vallance, the former chief scientific advisor, to the UK Covid-19 Inquiry. Vallance stated that Johnson struggled to understand the science during the pandemic and that he and others faced repeated problems getting Johnson to understand the science.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Covid-19 testing is only effective in 7% of cases is based on a misinterpretation of Johnson's comments. Johnson was referring to a report that found that only testing people once on arrival in the UK had a 7% success rate, while testing people a second time between the 5th and 10th day of their home quarantine identified Covid-19 infections in between 85% to 98% of cases.

The vice president got roasted on Twitter, on TV and by the campaign of Joe Biden after being caught by a live microphone jokingly offering to carry empty boxes \"just for the camera\" into a nursing home treating coronavirus cases. The offer, seemingly made in jest, came during a photo opportunity for media on Thursday at the the Woodbine Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Alexandria, Virginia. This happened a day before a Pence aide tested positive for coronavirus, and on the same day that news broke that a personal valet for President Donald Trump also tested positive for the virus, which causes Covid-19.\n\"Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing: A big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing,\" Kimmel cracked.

Pence was joking about carrying empty boxes for a staged publicity stunt, as Kimmel later acknowledged. The claim that Pence pretended the boxes were heavy when they were empty is not supported by the evidence.", "response": "FALSE."}

This is similar to the claim, but it doesn't mention if the damage is permanent.\n\nInformation 2, from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explains that COVID-19 symptoms are a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection, and this response can damage body systems. It also mentions that some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, which can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. This information suggests that the damage to nerve cells is not necessarily permanent.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2013, discusses COVID-19 complications that may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.

The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection.

The Donald and his entourage were at a Honeywell factory to witness the production of anti-COVID-19 N95 masks, with the soundtrack reportedly consisting of the likes of Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger and Animals' House Of The Rising Sun. But, as Trump turned to one worker to ask how many masks were made in a day, symphonic rock hit Live And Let Die could be heard playing in the background.\nOf course, the internet instantly jumped on the irony of the track playing over Trump's visit, with U.S. TV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.\nTV host Jimmy Kimmel writing on Twitter: “I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song Live And Let Die blares in the background.” · Live And Let Die was originally written by Sir Paul McCartney for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name, and performed by Wings.

Trump did not wear a face mask during his visit, which sparked criticism and controversy. Guns N' Roses' cover of \"Live and Let Die\" was played in the background as Trump toured the factory. In response to this event, Guns N' Roses released a shirt with the slogan \"Live N' Let Die With COVID 45\", referencing Trump as the 45th president of the United States. The shirt is priced at $25 and all proceeds go to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the event, including reactions from TV host Jimmy Kimmel and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for Americans to wear face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nClaim Analysis:\n\nThe claim is that during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump visited a manufacturing plant without wearing a face mask as Guns N' Roses' rendition of \"Live and Let Die\" played on loudspeakers during his visit.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is TRUE.

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24]. Vitamin C has many properties that make it a valuable therapeutic agent for respiratory infections.\nThis may provide timely data on the possible preventive and therapeutic values of vitamin C for medical and public interest in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Forged in opposition — first to the military regime, then to a series of democratically elected governments — the PT has held the Brazilian presidency since 2003, first under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and now under Dilma Rousseff.\nIndicators of change include ideological moderation, reform of internal decision-making structures, new relationships with civil society organisations, the willingness to ally with centre and right-wing parties, construction of a new electoral base among Brazil’s poor majority, and overall a general reorientation of the party’s public image. This panel takes stock of the changes within the PT since the first presidential victory in 2002.
