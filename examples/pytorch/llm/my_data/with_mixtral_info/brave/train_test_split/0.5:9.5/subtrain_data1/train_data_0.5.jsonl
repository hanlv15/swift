International offers of aid are multiplying.\nBy Claire Klobucista, Author and Sabine Baumgartner, Photo Editor ... No country has experienced as devastating a wave of COVID-19 infections as India is now. It set a new record for single-day infections last week, overtaking the United States, and it accounts for almost half of new cases worldwide. Experts say a combination of factors gave rise to the explosion in cases: new variants of the virus, including one first detected in India, that are thought to be more transmissible; a weak government response; and large public gatherings.\nThe average deaths per day are nearing 2,500, and the number continues to climb, pushing cremation facilities and cemeteries past their limits. Overall, the Indian government has reported around 195,000 deaths from COVID-19, but analysts say the total is likely much greater.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Edge of crisis: When kids suffer from COVID-19 - Down To Earth\nContent:\nWith children reporting severe post-COVID-19 symptoms, India must prioritise its paediatric infrastructure ...

Even after four days of care, the fever persisted and the family from Surat, Gujarat, took the infant to his paediatrician. Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors. It usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from COVID-19, suggest the “Guidelines on Operationalization of COVID Care Services for Children & Adolescents”, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in June 2021.\nWhile the proportion of children getting infected by COVID-19 is still not frightening, it is significant enough to establish that children are not as immune to post-COVID-19 complications as thought. Even the sketchy government numbers suggest a steady increase in the share of children in India’s total active COVID-19 cases, which includes patients still infectious.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How India is dealing with COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nIndia, which has the second-largest population in the world is suffering severely from COVID-19 disease. By May 18th, India investigated ∼1 lakh (0.1million) infected cases from COVID-19, and as of 11th July the cases equalled 8 lakhs. Social distancing and lockdown rules were employed in India, which however had an additional impact on the economy, human living, and environment.\nCOVID-19 outbreak is the sixth PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola (2014 in West Africa), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo) [3]. India which is the second-largest population in the world having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on18th May 2020, and as of 11th of July crossed 8.5 lakhs.\nCOVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time.

Furthermore, then-Vice President Biden did not always reverse his stance on the issue, as suggested by the claim.

This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is “a gross misinterpretation” of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nThat specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says.\nThe 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation most likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.\nEven someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.

It also explains that deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were estimated and comparing these two sets of estimates can provide insight about how many excess deaths are identified as due to COVID-19, and how many excess deaths are reported as due to other causes of death.\n\nInformation 2, published on September 17, 2020, states that overall about one in thirteen deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death, but this proportion has risen substantially to nearly a third over the last eight weeks. It also explains that COVID-19 should be recorded on the medical certificate of cause of death for all decedents where the disease caused or contributed to death, and that if COVID-19 is present on the death certificate as a significant condition contributing to death but not the underlying cause, these deaths \"are not deaths due to COVID-19 and should not be certified as such.\"\n\nInformation 3, published on April 1, 2020, emphasizes that COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that infrared thermometers can damage the pineal gland.", "response": "FALSE."}

The labeling does not refer to the current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) specifically, but rather to other strains of the human coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, without a specific publication date, discusses a Facebook post that claims a Clorox bottle could kill the 2019 coronavirus before it was discovered.

Additionally, the US EPA's List N, published on 2020-03-13, includes disinfectants that are expected to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus when used according to the label directions, indicating that these products were not specifically tested against the virus before 2019.", "response": "FALSE."}

The team at the small hospital soon realised this was not an isolated case. The virus had long spread outside the city of Wuhan, China, which had been under a strict lockdown for more than a month.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-30\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Italy is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. One week later an Italian man repatriated to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalized and confirmed as the third case in Italy. Clusters of cases were later detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February, with the first deaths on 22 February.\nThe majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters. On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in lockdown. On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and restricted movement of people.\nOn 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak. In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas: The number of new cases and deaths per day in Italy from COVID-19 showing the effects of lockdown and lifting\nThe governor of Basilicata, Vito Bardi, instituted a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people arriving from areas in Northern Italy affected by the outbreak. The Ministry of Health announced that it had engaged 31 laboratories in Italy to carry out the analysis of swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases. Minister Roberto Speranza appointed Walter Ricciardi, a member of World Health Organization's executive committee and former president of Italian National Institute of Health, as a special adviser for relations between Italy and international health organisations.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Italy Coronavirus Map and Case Count - The New York Times\nContent:\nSee the latest charts and maps of coronavirus <strong>cases</strong>, deaths and vaccinations <strong>in</strong> <strong>Italy</strong>.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Italy COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer\nContent:\n<strong>Italy</strong> Coronavirus update with statistics and graphs: total and new <strong>cases</strong>, deaths per <strong>day</strong>, mortality and recovery rates, current active <strong>cases</strong>, recoveries, trends and timeline.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-11-09\nTitle: How covid-19 surprised Italy again - The Washington Post\nContent:\nCrisanti said no country can keep pace with contact tracing when it is seeing 35,000 cases per day, as Italy is now. But Italy could have given itself a better chance to contain the wave if it had built more labs across the country, performing granular surveillance of hot-spot neighborhoods and workplaces, at the first beginning of the uptick. Crisanti said Italy should have been testing 400,000 people per day at the end of the summer when it was instead testing 75,000. The summer heightened the dangers for what Italians call the “rientro” — the post-holiday return to city life.\nHospitals now have more protective gear, more ventilators and more intensive-care capacity than in the spring. But Italy’s breakdown came in an earlier line of defense: Contact tracers increasingly struggled to identify and isolate infected people before the virus spread through communities. ... The contact-tracing system “crumbled as soon as we exceeded 1,000 cases per day,” said Andrea Crisanti, a virologist at the University of Padua who advised the Veneto region in the spring.\nSeveral European scientists, including in Italy, made the case that the virus had weakened, a minority scientific position that nonetheless captured attention with summer hospitalization rates so low. Italy had given itself one of the best chances among European countries to sustainably contain the virus after the spring crisis. Its emergence from the March and April lockdown had been anything but swift or reckless, with new reopenings coming at two-week intervals to gauge their riskiness.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had said in August that the country would be able to deal with any future increases in cases without limits on “economic activity.” · All along, some degree of resurgence was inevitable — especially as the weather cooled and people began to socialize more indoors. But Italian health officials had reasoned that a second wave wouldn’t be nearly as severe as the first. Hospitals were more prepared.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-01, states that the first COVID-19 case in Italy was confirmed on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-12-30, confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 9 March 2020.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, published on 2020-04-22 and without a specific date, provide real-time updates on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-11-09, states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. The article also mentions that hospitals were more prepared for a second wave of the virus, but the contact-tracing system had already crumbled.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true. The pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, which occurred in February and March 2020, as the country struggled to cope with the sudden surge of cases. However, the claim does not mention any specific date or context for the pictures.\n\nThe information published on 2021-02-01 and 2023-12-30 confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020. Therefore, it is possible that the pictures in question were taken during the first wave of the virus in Italy.\n\nHowever, the information published on 2020-11-09 states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. This suggests that the situation in Italy had worsened again by November 2020, and the country was facing a second wave of the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true, it does not provide enough context or evidence to support the claim. The available information suggests that the pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, but it is also possible that they are from a later stage of the pandemic when the country was facing a second wave of the virus.

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %).

In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown.

While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

A US$15 million grant towards the trial was awarded to Novavax by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 2665 healthy adults and nearly 240 medically stable, HIV-positive adults will be enrolled. “The major motivation for COVID-19 vaccines being evaluated at an early stage in South Africa is to generate evidence in the African context on how well these vaccines work in settings such as our own”, says principle investigator of the Novavax clinical trial Shabir Madhi, Wits Professor of Vaccinology.\nThe first trial, also led by Madhi, of a COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa commenced on June 23, which was the first vaccine candidate to be tested in Africa.

Several widely shared letters by small groups of scientists from different countries pushed strongly in the direction of a natural origin, calling suggestions that COVID-19 emerged in a lab a conspiracy theory.\nChinese officials have consistently rejected not only the hypothesis that the virus originated at the Wuhan laboratory, but that it originated in China at all. Additionally, Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn’t leak from her laboratory. (In April 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health pulled funding for a research project on coronaviruses in which the Wuhan institute was a chief partner.) Meanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States.\nMeanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States. The accusations come amid tensions between Washington and Beijing. Throughout 2020, the Donald Trump administration repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic, adding further friction to a relationship already strained by a trade war and U.S. responses to China’s rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, among other issues.\nMany critics say Trump’s use of inflammatory rhetoric such as “China virus” and “kung flu” contributed to a rise in anti-Asian bias in the United States amid the pandemic. President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts. On February 1, 2020, the People's Bank of China announced it would temporarily suspend the inclusion of mortgage and credit card payments in the credit record of people impacted by the pandemic.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The COVID lab-leak hypothesis: what scientists do and don’t know\nContent:\nDebate over the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged from a laboratory has escalated over the past few weeks, coinciding with the annual World Health Assembly, at which the World Health Organization (WHO) and officials from nearly 200 countries discussed the COVID-19 pandemic.

In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nSome people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells.\nThe loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different—even sometimes unpleasant or foul—than people remember prior to being infected.\nThis can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months.

This is similar to the claim, but it doesn't mention if the damage is permanent.\n\nInformation 2, from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explains that COVID-19 symptoms are a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection, and this response can damage body systems. It also mentions that some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, which can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells.

However, this damage is potentially treatable and may not be permanent, as the nerve cells can repair themselves or be replaced by new cells. Therefore, the claim \"Permanent Nerve Damage for Some COVID-19 Survivors\" needs to be clarified to specify that the nerve damage may not be permanent.", "response": "TRUE."}

The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.)

Trump, however, has repeatedly denied that the rise in cases reflects increased transmission of the virus, and has instead insisted that increased testing is the cause. The president began pinning the blame on testing as early as June 15, when in a tweet he said that because U.S. testing “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country … it shows more cases.” He called testing a “double edged sword” because it is “good to” have, but “[m]akes us look bad.”\nLater in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths. “Cases up only because of our big number testing,” he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. “Mortality rate way down!!!” · The same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, discusses the increasing coronavirus death toll in the United States, which was about 80,000 at the time. It also highlights that President Trump had been praising the overall number of tests conducted in the country, which had surpassed 8 million. However, Senator Lamar Alexander, who was set to chair a hearing on Tuesday, had stated that the testing conducted in the U.S. so far was not nearly enough.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 14, 2020, confirms that President Trump did say increased COVID-19 testing makes the U.S. look bad by increasing coronavirus case numbers.\n\nInformation 3, published on July 20, 2020, discusses President Trump's claim that testing creates more cases. The article argues that this claim is incorrect, based on a STAT analysis of testing data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, but it appears to be a fact-checking article that discusses President Trump's claim that coronavirus testing makes the U.S. look bad. The article also mentions that Trump has called testing \"overrated\" and repeatedly said the high number of confirmed cases makes the U.S. look bad.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 25, 2020, discusses President Trump's claim that the surge in COVID-19 cases is only due to testing. The article argues that this claim is false and that data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing.\n\nBased on the available information, it is clear that President Trump did say that increased COVID-19 testing makes the U.S. look bad by increasing coronavirus case numbers (Claim is TRUE). However, the subsequent information published on July 20, 2020, and June 25, 2020, contradicts the president's claim that testing creates more cases or that the surge in cases is only due to testing. These claims are false, as increased testing is necessary to detect more cases, and the uptick in cases in many places outstrips the increase in testing.", "response": "TRUE."}

Community mask wearing is an effective non-medical way to reduce the spread of this infection. It is effective in preventing someone from spreading or getting the virus (JAMA Network). Face masks can be safely worn by all children 2 years of age and older, including the vast majority of children with underlying health conditions, with rare exception (AAP, 2022). ... As always, if you have questions about COVID-19 or the vaccines, you can always ask your health care provider.\nResearch shows that under most circumstances, mask wearing has no significant adverse health effects on the people who wear them (CDC, 2021). Masks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, which is especially important people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic.

Participants enrolled during September 9–December 1, 2021, (534) were also asked to indicate the type of face covering typically worn (N95/KN95 respirator, surgical mask, or cloth mask) in indoor public settings.\nIn addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a comfortable, well-fitting face mask or respirator in indoor public settings protects against acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection; a respirator offers the best protection.\nAmong 534 participants who specified the type of face covering they typically used, wearing N95/KN95 respirators (aOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05–0.64) or surgical masks (aOR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13–0.90) was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator. These findings reinforce that in addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings reduces the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThese findings reinforce that in addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings reduces the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a respirator offers the highest level of personal protection against acquiring infection, although it is most important to wear a mask or respirator that is comfortable and can be used consistently.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-12, is a fact-check by Science Feedback stating that a CDC study published in September 2020 did not show that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, and that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The study mentioned in the claim is a case-control study, which is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention when it is widely used.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-15, is an article by ABC News discussing a review from the Cochrane Library that found masks don't work in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. However, experts told ABC News that the findings from the review have not been accurately represented and that evidence shows masks do help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-10-14, is a review by Health Feedback stating that scientific evidence supports the use of face masks as an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19. The claim that a CDC study shows that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers is false.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-05-24, is a fact sheet by Delaware's Division of Public Health stating that masks are effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly. Masks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, especially important for asymptomatic or presymptomatic people.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-02-10, is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published on 2020-10-12, states that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\nThe claim is false, as multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Information 1, 3, and 4 all state that masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Information 5 is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a case-control study, which is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention when it is widely used.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19 is false. Multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

The results can be used by nurse leaders to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nursing staff members working during COVID-19.\nInterventions can improve the recognition of psychological symptoms among nurses exposed to traumatic events. Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The best course of action if you’re concerned about your symptoms is to talk with your doctor. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about how anxiety affects your body and the overlap of symptoms with COVID-19.\nPreliminary research suggests that COVID-19 can cause digestive symptoms including a loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. If you’re having a hard time determining if the tightness in your chest and shallow breathing are related to your increased anxiety or a potential sign of COVID-19, you’re not alone. Because we’re still learning about the coronavirus, we can’t know exactly what symptoms it causes for most people.\nAs things develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s one thing just about everybody has in common: A drastic increase in anxiety. Whether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically.\nWhether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone. If you’ve experienced anxiety or panic before, you’ve probably experienced symptoms that manifest physically. You might find yourself breathing shallowly or ever experience flu-like aches. When we’re all on the look-out for potential COVID-19 symptoms — shortness of breath, cough and fever — those physical anxiety symptoms can ratchet your fear up even higher.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-08-12, describes the physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks and those of COVID-19. It explains that anxiety can cause chest pain and other physical symptoms, which might make a person worry that they have COVID-19. Information 2, published on 2020-11-09, also discusses the similarities between anxiety symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms, and provides advice on how to differentiate between the two. Information 3 is a study abstract that examines the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among those who receive a positive COVID-19 test. Information 4, from UW Medicine, explains the differences between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms, and recommends checking for fever and paying attention to racing thoughts and muscle tension. Information 5, published on 2020-03-25, discusses how anxiety can affect the body and cause symptoms that overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"What is the difference between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms?\" is true, as there are several resources available that provide information on how to differentiate between anxiety and COVID-19 symptoms. These resources explain that while anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, COVID-19 is not currently associated with racing thoughts or muscle tension. Additionally, taking one's temperature and paying attention to one's thoughts and body can help determine whether symptoms are caused by anxiety or COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

Although vaccination does provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection, these findings suggest that COVID-19 can cause long-term damage to the immune system and make someone less able to fight off reinfection.\nT cells are an important part of the immune system. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines give these cells information about SARS-CoV-2 so that they can attack the virus and any infected cells to keep the infection from spreading.

Future research can examine how to strengthen T cells to better protect people who have previously gotten sick. However, no matter whether a person is vaccinated before or after they get COVID-19, vaccination against future cases of COVID-19 will still provoke a stronger immune response than the response of unvaccinated people.\nPeople who were vaccinated but had contracted COVID-19 before their vaccination had a lower number of CD8+ T cells, and people who had never been vaccinated had the lowest amount. The T cells in those two groups were also less able to recruit B cells to fight future infections.

Besides the risk of infections owing to lowered immune functions, there is a possible risk of unknown organ damage caused by the vaccine that has remained hidden without apparent clinical presentations, mainly in the circulatory system. Therefore, careful risk assessments prior to surgery and invasive medical procedures are essential. Randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm these clinical observations. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nRecently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.\nThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals. According to European Medicines Agency recommendations, frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible.\nThe decrease in immunity can be caused by several factors such as N1-methylpseudouridine, the spike protein, lipid nanoparticles, antibody-dependent enhancement, and the original antigenic stimulus. These clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: 5 Things You Should Know about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nWe have multiple years of experience showing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the strains of virus causing most of the disease change and immunity wanes over time. The changes from last year’s vaccines are small, but they help make the vaccine better at targeting the virus strains circulating now and give your immune system a boost.\nBottom line: CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against potentially serious COVID-19 outcomes this fall and winter. This is especially important for older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who are at highest risk for severe illness.\nThe virus is constantly changing, and our immunity, whether from vaccines or previous infections, fades. Getting updated vaccines like the updated COVID-19 vaccines that are available now continues to be important, especially for older people and those with certain medical conditions.\nImmune protection from both vaccines and previous infections can decline over time and as new variants emerge.

After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA.

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency.\nIn the wake of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the practice of ophthalmology has undergone a dramatic and unprecedented shift. The inherent risk of transmission is high due to the need for patient proximity during an ophthalmic exam or surgery, which has led to at least one outbreak in Norway [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. In March 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued practice guidelines and released a list of emergent ophthalmic surgical procedures to be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15]. Subsequently, the rescheduling of routine ocular examinations and limiting procedures to those deemed urgent or emergent has been the basis of many recent publications [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Each has offered specialty specific guidelines to limit transmission moving forward, while allowing for the gradual increase in ophthalmic exams, intraocular injections, and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nAdherence to these recommendations has resulted in an estimated 75% or more reduction of in-person clinic volumes [28]. Concurrently, the implementation of telemedicine visits resulted in an alternative way to provide continued care [3, 25, 29,30,31]. However, the exact reduction of in-patient visits, increase in telemedicine encounters, and the change in the types of diagnoses seen within in an ophthalmology clinic before and after COVID-19 remains unknown.

The study was conducted at Yale University by two trainees and a lead scientist. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not\nThe ketogenic diet has become a popular way to shed unwanted pounds and a recent study reveals it can also fight off the flu. Researchers fed mice infected with the influenza virus a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which resulted in a higher survival rate than compared to those on a normal high-carbohydrate diet. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung and trapped the virus before it became worse.\nDuring the study, the team showed that mice infected with the flu virus that were fed the keto diet had a higher survival rate than mice on a high-carb normal diet. The researchers were more excited to find the details behind this event. The keto diet actually triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not. When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.\nThe two trainees are, Ryan Molony who found that immune system activators called inflammasomes can cause harmful immune system responses in their host, and Emily Goldberg who worked in Dixit's lab, which had shown that the ketogenic diet blocked formation of inflammasomes.

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China.

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways. OSA and safety issues have been recognized and mitigated among the airline and transport industries; however, the healthcare industry lags in addressing these concerns.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-11-24\nTitle: Sick and Tired: Study Reveals Toll of Poor Sleep Among Health Care ...\nContent:\nThat constellation of troubles could worsen the overlapping crises already enveloping health care. \"Right now, a large percentage of health care workers are leaving their jobs because of the stress, producing a shortage of health care workers nationally,” says the studies’ lead author Marwah Abdalla, MD, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “With fewer workers on the job, the remaining staff must work more and longer shifts, exacerbating their sleep problems and stress.”\n24, finds that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression than their better-rested colleagues and were 50% more likely to report psychological distress and 70% more likely to report anxiety.

On the most basic level, insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness and feelings of fatigue. Sleep disturbances cause reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impair our ability to maintain focus. [These effects can be a matter of life or death when it comes to patient care.] There is an often-cited study where participants were tested on a hand-eye coordination performance task under conditions of sleep deprivation and while consuming progressive amounts of alcohol.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Lack of sleep is harming health care workers – and their patients\nContent:\nMany people often assume that health care providers are healthier than the general population. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has shined a concerning light on the the physical and mental health of health care workers – and their lack of sleep.\nI am an expert in sleep and stress among middle-aged adults in the workplace, and my research has found that work-related stress influences sleep quantity and quality. And not only that – poor sleep may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for both health care workers and their patients.\nHealth care workers face many stressors, and many studies have shown that sleep plays a major role. For example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\nFor example, a 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media.\nA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Sleep disorders, particularly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), affect a significant number of healthcare workers (HCWs). These sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, daytime drowsiness, and sleep deprivation, which can impair work productivity, lead to occupational accidents and errors, and negatively impact patient care. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA, and 40.9% of HCWs reported at least one type of sleep disorder.\n2. A study published in 2021 found that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression, 50% more likely to report psychological distress, and 70% more likely to report anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened sleep patterns and mental health issues among HCWs due to increased stress and workload.\n3. Insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impairments in maintaining focus. These effects can have severe consequences in patient care.\n4. Health care workers face significant work-related stress, which can negatively impact sleep quantity and quality. A 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\n5.

Researchers are intent on finding out why. “For almost every infectious disease, the most vulnerable populations are at the extremes of age — the very young and the very old,” said Stanford Medicine professor of microbiology and immunology and of pathology Bali Pulendran, PhD. “But with COVID-19, the young are spared while the old are emphatically not.\nThe scientists pivoted to a study of COVID-19 in kids. Florian Wimmers, PhD, then a postdoc in Pulendran’s lab, and his colleagues got hold of nasal and blood samples collected from 54 infants who’d become infected with SARS-CoV-2 before reaching age 2, and from 27 other children who’d tested negative throughout the observation period. For comparison, the researchers obtained similar samples from several dozen adults. All infected children in the study were, at most, mildly symptomatic.\nAnother difference: In the blood of adults with even mild COVID-19 cases, there was a big increase in levels of a number of inflammation-promoting signaling proteins, previously shown to be associated with more-severe symptoms. In infected kids’ blood, this increase wasn’t seen.\nPulendran wants to see if any of this nasal magic extends beyond COVID-19 — he is now collaborating with the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital group on influenza and other viruses.

We demonstrate that the candidate vaccines BNT162b1 or BNT162b2—lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode secreted, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or prefusion-stabilized S, respectively—induce strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice and macaques.\nTherefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19 vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses. Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

Research with animals connects these vaccines with other SARS-CoV-2 scientific advancements just as it has made connections among NPRC HIV/AIDS studies, the results from which facilitated the rapid pace to COVID-19 discoveries.\nBut if everyone knew how critical animals have been in 2020 to fast-track a safe and effective COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine, would that change? Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) called upon the National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) – as NIH has for HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika and other infectious disease threats – to identify animal species for studying the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developing safe and effective vaccines to block it.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: Experimental NIH Sudan virus vaccine protects macaques | National ...\nContent:\nA National Institutes of Health research group with extensive experience studying ebolavirus countermeasures has successfully developed a vaccine against Sudan virus (SUDV) based on the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine.

This is in line with the information presented in Information 1 and 2, both of which report on studies showing that COVID-19 vaccine candidates are effective in protecting rhesus macaques from the virus. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely true.\n\nIt is worth noting that the studies reported in Information 1 and 2 were conducted in the early stages of COVID-19 vaccine development, and the vaccines have since undergone further testing and have been shown to be effective in humans as well.

While the lockdown had been lifted in most provinces and municipalities, it was still enforced in Greater Buenos Aires, which represents around 60% of the Argentine economy. On this day, the stay-at-home order had been in place for 90 days, making it the longest mandatory quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis article lists and summarizes such activities in various countries around the world. Protest against the COVID-19 vaccine in Dublin, Ireland. In order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus which gave rise to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019, governments brought in health measures at varying levels of strictness to restrict the movement of people and transmission of the virus.\nBetween August and October 2021, several protests were held across New Zealand to protest official lockdown measures, vaccination, and spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Key groups and individuals that were involved in these protests included FACTS NZ, Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa, the NZ Liberty Movement and Jami-Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika's Advance New Zealand party. In January 2021, Te Kahika led a \"freedom rally\" outside the New Zealand Parliament; protestors opposed lockdown policies, while expressing support for US President Donald Trump and QAnon.\nOn this day, the stay-at-home order had been in place for 90 days, making it the longest mandatory quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 July, the country's Independence Day, protests flared up once again. In addition to workers and entrepreneurs asking to be allowed to work, many were angered by the fact that Lazaro Baez, who is serving jail time for money laundering and stealing from taxpayers' money and is associated with much of the government staff, could be eligible for parole. This incident, and the murder of Fabián Gutiérrez, who was ex-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's secretary while she was in office, which many opposition affiliates believe was orchestrated by the administration and covered up as a \"crime of passion\" by two unknown men, also caused large outrage in some sectors of the population.\nProtests, demonstrations and strikes occurred around the world against national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by governmental bodies.

Our study did not find evidence of increased COVID-19 hospitalization rates after protests occurred in California counties. While the limitations noted underscore the need for caution with interpreting a causal relationship from our findings, the results do support the notion that it is possible to protest safely in the midst of a pandemic, ostensibly, so long as evidence-based precautionary measures are taken [48]. As the pandemic continues into its second year, public demonstrations related to COVID-19 and societal issues remain fixtures of daily life around the world [49]. Further research is needed to understand both the individual-level relationship between protest participation, SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality, particularly with more virulent strains such as the Delta variant resulting in breakthrough cases among vaccin\nThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship between public protests and county-level, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization rates across California. Publicly available data were included in the analysis from 55 of 58 California state counties (29 March–14 October 2020). Mixed-effects negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between daily county-level COVID-19 hospitalizations and two main exposure variables: any vs. no protests and 1 or >1 protest vs. no protests on a given county-day.\nThree spline variables were created to represent the three time periods in our models based on visual observation of average changes in county hospitalization rates over time (see Supplementary Figure S1 for observed vs. predicted COVID-19 hospitalization rates using this time trend). The knots (1 June and 21 July) were also selected since they provided the best model fit to predict COVID-19 hospitalization using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). To explore patterns in the data, graphs were used to describe (1) the daily average COVID-19 hospitalization rate and the total number of protests across the total sample of 55 counties, and (2) the proportion of protests by protest type, overall and for the counties with any protests.\nEthical review and approval were waived for this study since only publicly available data were used.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an upsurge of protests. The emergence of civil resistance movements is often associated with various conditions of social systems. The analysis of social systems also shows the importance of considering the behaviour time scale and in particular slow-fast dynamics. The fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon.\nThe fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon. This paper proposes a holistic approach to explore the relationship between societal conditions and the emergence of protests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the following sections we introduce a holistic analysis approach to the emergence of civil resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we discuss the theoretical basis of our approach and develop a casual loop diagram to capture these findings and conceptually model the emergence of civil resistance at a societal level. Using this conceptual model, several hypotheses on the impact of societal conditions to the emergence of protests are tested.\nWith this computational approach, we can test whether existing theoretical models for the emergence of protests provide a realistic explanation for the emergence of protest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our CLD and statistical analysis, we can model latent processes that yield protests as a function of significant factors identified with our statistical analysis.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1.

The COVID-19 has then rapidly spread to all over China and the world. It can cause symptoms including fever, difficulty in breathing, cough, and invasive lesions on both lungs of the patients [1]. It can spread to the lower respiratory tract and cause viral pneumonia.\nWuhan is a transportation hub of China, it is a highly dense city and has a large population of more than 14 million in 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) had a meeting on January 30, 2020 and they declared the coronavirus outbreak from China a public health emergency of international concern.\nIt just took 1 month for China to recognize the existence of a novel coronavirus after the first case was reported, followed with a series mandatory actions in both Wuhan and all over China. In contrast, it took more than 4 months for SARS. On December 31, 2019, delegates of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) went to Wuhan for field investigations, and the sample of new virus was isolated and further identified as a pathogen of unexplained pneumonia on January 6, 2020.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 from Lead Stories (published on 2020-02-14) both fact-check a claim that a residential building was set on fire in Wuhan to control the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser.\nIrradiation of neurons leads to an elevated temperature local to the targeted cells, which transiently changes the membrane excitability. Opposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5]. Extended exposure to high-intensity infrared light can dramatically increase local temperature and cause tissue damage [10]. Limited exposure leads to less heat generation and generally reversible effects on neuronal activities.\nOpposite to photochemical effects, heat generation by light is more efficient in the long wavelength range, especially by infrared light [5]. Extended exposure to high-intensity infrared light can dramatically increase local temperature and cause tissue damage [10].

The \"CO\" stands for \"corona,\" \"VI\" stands for \"virus,\" and \"D\" stands for \"disease.\" The number 19 reflects the year the disease was identified, which was 2019.\n\nThe WHO specifically chose the name COVID-19 to avoid references to a geographical location, an animal, an individual, or a group of people. This was done to prevent the use of other names that could be inaccurate or stigmatizing.\n\nTherefore, the claim that COVID stands for \"Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease\" is false and misleading.

The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles. As a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued. In addition, the date of vaccination should be recorded in the medical record of patients. Several practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported.\nSeveral practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported. These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.\nThe time elapsed since the last COVID-19 vaccination may need to be considered when invasive procedures are required. Several practical measures that can be implemented to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported [16]. These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen, to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression [17].\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-12-13\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines do not weaken people’s immune systems ‘like ...\nContent:\nA British funeral director who has previously spread misinformation online has made multiple false claims about COVID-19 vaccines and their side effects in a video shared widely on social media. The footage has attracted hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter (here), and tens of thousands of views on Facebook and Bitchute (here, here, here, here, here and here , here, here, here and here). It features Milton Keynes-based John O’Looney, who claims COVID-19 vaccines stop immune systems from fighting off the Omicron variant, which he says is another name for the common cold.\nHe told Reuters: “There have been several key studies showing how our immune response to the coronavirus vaccine is significantly strengthened by subsequent booster vaccinations… Our experience is showing that a third COVID-19 vaccine provides high levels of immunity, and this is the rationale for the current booster programme in the UK.” · Explaining why the common cold may be in wider circulation this year, he added: “Last winter we were in lockdown and social mixing, especially indoors, was very limited.\nOur experience is showing that a third COVID-19 vaccine provides high levels of immunity, and this is the rationale for the current booster programme in the UK.” · Explaining why the common cold may be in wider circulation this year, he added: “Last winter we were in lockdown and social mixing, especially indoors, was very limited. This was very effective in limiting the spread of the coronavirus but also had other consequences.\nIt features Milton Keynes-based John O’Looney, who claims COVID-19 vaccines stop immune systems from fighting off the Omicron variant, which he says is another name for the common cold. O’Looney also compares this alleged effect to chemotherapy, a treatment for cancer that can hinder immunity due to reducing white blood cells produced by the bone marrow (here and here). “So, they’ve had the jabs maybe six to eight months ago and it’s been eating away at their immune system – and now they’re struggling to fight off things like the common cold,” O’Looney says in the clip.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy T cells or weaken immune system ...\nContent:\nThe vaccine doesn’t destroy T cells or weaken the immune system. On the contrary, it generates a strong T cell response and boosts immunity, according to experts. A researcher at the Francis Crick Institute told The Associated Press the claim distorts his team’s work, which did not examine T cells. THE FACTS: Articles that have amassed thousands of views across social media this week misrepresent a June study from Britain’s Francis Crick Institute, which looked at the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to produce neutralizing antibodies against viral variants.\nTHE FACTS: Articles that have amassed thousands of views across social media this week misrepresent a June study from Britain’s Francis Crick Institute, which looked at the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to produce neutralizing antibodies against viral variants. The articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.”\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others shows the vaccines boost the immune response. The mRNA vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, allowing it to generate an immune response, experts say.\nThe articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.” · But that’s not at all what the research shows, according to the Francis Crick Institute’s Dr. David Bauer, one of the study’s authors. “Our work to date has not studied T cells at all,” Bauer told the AP in an email. “All research published to date shows that the Pfizer (and other) vaccines generate a strong, positive, protective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2.” · Outside experts confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy or damage T cells.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-15, is a fact-check by Maldita.es stating that there has been no discovery that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-27, discusses a study that found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 and then vaccinated had lower levels of CD8 cells, a type of T cell, compared to those who were vaccinated and had not been infected. However, this study does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, discusses the adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them. It mentions that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of Covid-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals. However, this information does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-12-13, is an article addressing false claims made by a British funeral director about Covid-19 vaccines weakening the immune system and stopping the body's ability to fight off the Omicron variant. The article explains that studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines boost the immune response and that the claim that the vaccine destroys T cells or weakens the immune system is false.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is an article addressing false claims that a study from the Francis Crick Institute shows that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine \"destroys T cells\" and \"weakens the immune system.\" The article explains that the study did not examine T cells and that outside experts have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines do not destroy or damage T cells.\n\nIn summary, all of the provided information contradicts the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system. Studies have shown that the vaccine generates a strong T cell response and boosts immunity. There is no evidence to support the claim that the vaccine destroys T cells or weakens the immune system.\n\nTherefore, the claim is: FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines.\nThe only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example.\nBut posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past.\nOther posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates. In reality, no mRNA versions of an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in any country, according to our research, although some non-mRNA designs have been rolled out in places such as China.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories: The need for ...\nContent:\nWe also identified other misinformation related to children and soldiers dying after receiving the vaccine in multiple countries; it was reported on Facebook that seven children died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Senegal. Lastly, it was falsely reported that Bill Gates had said that 700,000 people would be injured or die from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Tim Nguyen, the head of high impact events preparedness unit at WHO, “You need to have a certain degree of good information out there to reach populations so that they are inoculated and not susceptible to fake news or disinformation…we believe we need to vaccinate 30% of the population with good information in order to have a certain degree of herd immunity against misinformation” [48]. Websites that provide evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines should be developed and disseminated globally as the use of such trusted sources of information have been found effective against misinformation and conspiracy theories [11].\nRumors about the use of vaccination campaigns for political purposes are not new, and such rumors have previously affected vaccination campaigns in some countries, such as Pakistan [38]. During a public health emergency, when there is considerable scientific uncertainty, and political leaders act as frontline crises managers, it often becomes challenging to ensure evidenced-based recommendation over political interest [35]. For example, the statement, “Whether the vaccine comes or not, coronavirus will leave the country” made by a health minister is likely to confuse the public about the necessity of the vaccine [39]. It thus may affect vaccine acceptancy. The claim that vaccine against COVID-19 had already been invented may lead some to come to the conclusion that this pandemic was being used in an attempt to further vaccine sales [40, 41]. Such misinformation may lead to mistrust on pharmaceutical companies, healthcare agencies and emergency responders and impact overall vaccine acce\n43. ABC News.

Suicide prevention strategies must be tailored to better address disparities in youth suicide risk.\nSchool settings can play an important role in suicide prevention by providing age-appropriate programs that reach a large and diverse number of youth. Although the impact of school closures on youth suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear, racial and ethnic disparities in access to in-person instruction have been documented during the pandemic, and the lack of live instruction has been associated with impaired academic progress, decreased physical activity, lower levels of social and emotional support, and greater emotional distress and exposure to in-home conflict.48 Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of school-based suicide prevention programs to increase mental health literacy, enhance awareness about suicide risk, and to decrease the incidence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation.49–51 Opportunities exist to continue adapting these programs to broaden their reach with on-line modes of instruction and delivery.\nA recent US Surgeon General’s Advisory provides further research recommendations to effectively respond to the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of the nation’s youth.58 A Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion–informed framework applied to the study and prevention of youth suicide also offers a promising approach to achieving health equity and reducing suicide risk for all youth.59,60 Examining geographic variations in youth suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic is another important opportunity for future research, and a comparative analysis across subgroups may also shed perspective on this study’s findings.\nFindings highlight the need to identify potential mechanisms underlying differential increases in youth suicide deaths associated with the pandemic and to develop broadened and more effective suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide. Additionally, preteen rates of suicide are increasing warranting further research and clinical attention for this understudied subpopulation at risk. Future research is needed to understand the impact of racial and ethnic disparities62 on emotional and mental health of young people, and to monitor longer-term trends of COVID-19-related suicide morbidity and mortality.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Rethinking Youth Suicide Prevention During COVID - WebMD\nContent:\n<strong>COVID</strong>-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases. Here’s a quick guide on how to spot symptoms, risk factors, <strong>prevent</strong> spread of the disease, and find out what to do if you think you have it.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During the COVID-19 Pandemic - National ...\nContent:\nIn a new study supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, researchers examined national youth suicide trends and characteristics in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A research team led by Jeffrey Bridge, Ph.D. , Donna Ruch, Ph.D. , and Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., MPH, analyzed national suicide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers first identified all U.S. youth aged 5 to 24 years with suicide listed as the cause of death over the first 10 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020–December 31, 2020).\nThe significantly higher number of suicide deaths reported for certain racial and ethnic groups, specifically non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black youth, highlights ongoing disparities in rates of suicide that the pandemic may have exacerbated. The increase in suicide deaths among preteens also suggests that more attention may need to be paid to this age group, who tend to be understudied in suicide prevention research and have different developmental needs than older adolescents and young adults.\nThis study shows that the pandemic impacted youth suicide rates, but the impact was not the same for everyone and varied based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity. As such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups.\nAs such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups. Moreover, given the extended duration of the pandemic and its ongoing impact on young people in the United States, it will be important to monitor long-term trends in suicide rates associated with COVID-19 and identify factors driving the increased risk for suicide among some people.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During COVID-19 Pandemic, Especially ...\nContent:\nData suggest depression, anxiety and social isolation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to suicide risk in youth.  · In a study published today in Pediatrics, researchers in the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital found that in the United States, youth suicides increased during COVID-19, with significantly more suicides than expected among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth.\nNational trends in suicides were sourced from the Web-based Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Individuals aged 5-24 years between 2015 and 2020 with suicide listed as the cause of death were included in this analysis. The start of the COVID-19 period was defined as March 2020.  · A total of 5,568 youth living in the United States died by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThis is a group of young people that typically have a very low rate of suicide relative to other young people, and to see an increase in their rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was a cause for concern,” said Donna Ruch, PhD, co-author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Suicide Prevention Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  · The findings of this study highlight the importance of suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide.\n“To our knowledge, no national study examined changes in youth suicide rates that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeffrey A Bridge, PhD, lead author of the study and director of the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “We wanted to a see if there were any changes in the youth suicide rate that occurred and whether these changes happened with the onset of the pandemic.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Suicide spectrum among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: ...\nContent:\nThird, from a wider perspective, the present work calls for urgent investments in the mental health area aimed at offering the young people easy and free access to the services, both in schools and in other public institutions, to enable the early detection of mental disorders and the prevention of the escalation into suicidality. However, literature about youth suicidality during COVID-19 is still expanding and further research is needed to clarify this complex clinical and public health issue.\nAfter the reopenings, we could have assisted to a sort of rebound, in which long-lasting COVID-19 related worries and a potentially hard adaptation to frequent social interactions after months of limitations could have strongly affected the most vulnerable youth's mental health. These findings have great relevance from both a clinical and a public health point of view. Understanding whether and how adolescents' mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can allow the implementation of tailored policies to prevent and control suicidal phenomena, and to improve the quality of life of this particularly susceptible population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2021, discusses a study on youth suicide during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that suicide deaths among US youth increased during COVID-19, with substantial variation by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and suicide method.

Therefore, we cannot use the information to confirm or deny the claim directly due to the sequential relationship between the dates.\n\nHowever, the claim can still be evaluated based on general knowledge and principles. Reducing pensions for current retirees is an extraordinary measure that would likely face significant opposition and legal challenges.

Hannah E. Davis, Lisa McCorkell, … Eric J. Topol ... Sydney R. Stein, Sabrina C. Ramelli, … Daniel S. Chertow · Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—can involve the pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system1. A few studies have investigated cardiovascular outcomes in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19; however, most were limited to hospitalized individuals (who represent the minority of people with COVID-19), and all had a short duration of follow-up and a narrow selection of cardiovascular outcomes2,3,4,5.\nA comprehensive assessment of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae of the cardiovascular system at 12 months is not yet available, and studies of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae across the spectrum of care settings of the acute infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care) are also lacking. Addressing this knowledge gap will inform post-acute COVID-19 care strategies. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 153,760 US veterans who survived the first 30 d of COVID-19 and two control groups: a contemporary cohort consisting of 5,637,647 users of the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a historical cohort (pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic) consisting of 5,859,411 non-COVID-19-infected VHA users during 2017.\nCare strategies of people who survived the acute episode of COVID-19 should include attention to cardiovascular health and disease. The broader implications of these findings are clear. Cardiovascular complications have been described in the acute phase of COVID-19 (refs. 6,7,8). Our study shows that the risk of incident cardiovascular disease extends well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of COVID-19 infection on the cardiovascular system: An ...\nContent:\nThrough these direct and indirect mechanisms, the heart is at an increased risk of experiencing permanent damage in vulnerable population groups who become infected with COVID-19, often resulting in myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases [62]. Although there is no consensus on treating these conditions, the primary recommendation is to treat the patient's underlying conditions and any new conditions that may occur, including myocardial infarction. Some medical providers administer low–molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin in acutely ill patients to avoid clotting. Further studies have indicated that there may be some benefit to administering fibrinolytic therapy whenever possible over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially to avoid unnecessary “hardware” to a person that would otherwise not need it [64].\nAs kidney pathology has a functional interface with the cardiovascular system, it is not surprising that renal manifestations are thought to contribute to the short- and long-term cardiovascular events observed in COVID-19 patients [32,38]. When researchers in New Orleans evaluated 287 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, they found that patients with metabolic syndrome were 3.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals without metabolic syndrome [39]. These deadly outcomes are often related to cardiovascular events as metabolic syndromes significantly increase a person's risk of developing a spectrum of cardiovascular conditions, such as cardiac dysfunction, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, microvascular dysfunction, and heart failure [40]. The underlying mechanisms responsible for kidney and heart disease co-existence include leukocyte infiltration into the myocardium and increased cytokine secretions that contribute to myocardial inflammation, injury, an\nAlthough there is no consensus about the treatment of these conditions, the main recommendation is to address the underlying conditions of the patient and any new conditions, including myocardial infarction, that may arise. In acutely ill patients, some medical practitioners prescribe low–molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin to prevent clotting. Further studies have shown that delivering fibrinolytic therapy can be of some benefit.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports. Despite the decrease in EVALI with the arrival of COVID-19, EVALI should still be considered a differential diagnosis for people with COVID-19 for reasons outlined in this review.\nAlthough easily forgotten in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a major outbreak of vaping-related illness dominated public health concerns before the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. This narrative review describes vaping devices, summarizes the adverse health effects of vaping on the lungs and other systems, considers the potential interplay between vaping and COVID-19, and highlights gaps in knowledge about vaping that warrant further research.\nHospitalizations for EVALI reached a peak in late 2019 and rapidly declined to extremely low numbers of reported cases by January 2020, just before the initial identification of COVID-19 cases in the United States.47 Although vaping-related illness may have nearly disappeared as a consequence of increased public awareness resulting in risk reduction by users and by removal of vitamin E acetate from vaping products, a case report of a patient in April 2020 reminds clinicians that EVALI should remain in the differential diagnosis for young patients admitted with severe lung injury.48 Presenting symptoms of EVALI (dyspnea, cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) overlap with those of COVID-19,36,49,50 and during population surges of the pandemic there is a tendency to narrow diagnostic considerations.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is about a false claim on Facebook where pictures of a crying child and two adults in hospital beds were shared with the claim that the family members are infected with COVID-19.

China has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-27\nTitle: Estimates Show Wuhan Death Toll Far Higher Than Official Figure\nContent:\nThis calculation results in an estimated 46,800 deaths. A resident of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, said most people there now believe that more than 40,000 people died in the city before and during the lockdown. \"Maybe the authorities are gradually releasing the real figures, intentionally or unintentionally, so that people will gradually come to accept the reality,\" the resident, who gave only his surname Mao, said.\nThe source said Wuhan saw 28,000 cremations in the space of a single month, suggesting that the online estimates over a two-and-a-half month period weren't excessive. Wuhan resident Sun Linan said relatives of those who died are now forming long lines outside funeral homes to collect their loved ones' ashes.\nWuhan resident Sun Linan said relatives of those who died are now forming long lines outside funeral homes to collect their loved ones' ashes. \"It has already begun,\" Sun said on Thursday. \"There were people lining up in Biandanshan Cemetery yesterday, and a lot of people forming lines today at Hankou Funeral Home.\" Hush money · Wuhan resident Chen Yaohui told RFA that city officials have been handing out 3,000 yuan in \"funeral allowances\" to the families of the dead in exchange for their silence.\n\"But during the epidemic, they transferred cremation workers from around China to Wuhan keep cremate bodies around the clock,\" he said. A resident surnamed Gao said the city's seven crematoriums should have a capacity of around 2,000 bodies a day if they worked around the clock.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: Worldometer provides a daily and weekly updated statistics tracking the number of COVID-19 cases, recovered, and deaths with historical data, cumulative charts, graphs, and updates.\n\nInformation 2: On January 27, 2020, Poynter (FactCheck.org) reported that the claim of 10,000 people dying in Wuhan, China, is false. As of early January 27, the estimated death toll was 81, all in China.\n\nInformation 3: The Coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. The first 100,000 patients identified were mostly in China, but the United States now has more cases than any other country, with over 20% of the world's total. The number of known global cases of COVID-19 passed 100,000 in early March, and over 2,100 people had died worldwide. As of April 17, there have been over 51,000 deaths and over 209,000 recoveries reported globally.\n\nInformation 4: In December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia in Wuhan. The WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on February 10, by which time the country had over 40,000 cases. Wuhan's death toll increased by almost exactly 50%, raising questions about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased. The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city to over 3,800, increasing the national total to over 4,600.\n\nInformation 5: Estimates show Wuhan's death toll is far higher than the official figure. A resident of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, said most people there now believe that more than 40,000 people died in the city before and during the lockdown. The source said Wuhan saw 28,000 cremations in the space of a single month, suggesting that the online estimates over a two-and-a-half month period weren't excessive. Wuhan resident Sun Linan said relatives of those who died are now forming long lines outside funeral homes to collect their loved ones' ashes. City officials have been handing out 3,000 yuan in \"funeral allowances\" to the families of the dead in exchange for their silence.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that 10,000 people have died in Wuhan, China, is false. As of January 27, 2020, the estimated death toll was 81, all in China. The latest official figures bring the death toll in Wuhan to over 3,800, increasing the national total to over 4,600. However, estimates show Wuhan's death toll is far higher than the official figure, with most people in Hubei province believing that more than 40,000 people died in the city before and during the lockdown. Wuhan saw 28,000 cremations in the space of a single month, suggesting that the online estimates over a two-and-a-half month period weren't excessive. Therefore, the claim is false, and the actual death toll in Wuhan is likely much higher than the official figure.", "response": "FALSE."}

This is a misunderstanding of a quote from him about the limitations of PCR testing in general, to find out about the exact levels of a virus in a sample, not whether or not the sample contained the virus.\nThere is absolutely no evidence that the inventor of the PCR process said this. PCR is used for a number of scientific processes, and in general, it amplifies bits of genetic information so that they can be detected within samples. But PCR tests are specific to the DNA they are testing for, whether that’s of a person or a virus, so aren’t “designed” to pick up the genetic material of the person being tested.\nHe didn’t say PCR testing couldn’t be used for testing for any diseases, as some social media posts claim. Confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in a 1996 article about HIV and AIDS. In this, neither the author of the article, nor Dr Mullis said PCR testing does not work or only identifies the DNA or RNA of the person being tested.\nHe did invent PCR, which is a process used to test whether someone currently has Covid-19.

Additionally, many of these posts have claimed that PCR testing returns a high number of false positives in a way that has inaccurately inflated the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19.\nThere are a few variants on the claim, but all of them make some reference to Kary Mullis, the American biochemist who created the PCR test, and suggest that he said the tests were not suitable for testing for viruses or Covid-19. PCR tests are used in Ireland and many other countries, and involve taking a swab from someone’s throat and nose and then using PCR – polymerase chain reaction – to detect the genetic material of the virus that causes Covid-19.\nAnother Facebook post, which has been shared 104 times, said that Mullins was the “inventor of the PCR Covid test” and that it was “not made to detect any kind of infectious disease.

At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:\nThis indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction. But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”\nAnd as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.” · So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, did not think alike.\nBut not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step.

This quote appears not to be a direct quote from the inventor, Kary Mullis, has lost some context and does not mean COVID-19 testing is fraudulent, as suggested by some social media posts.\nThe post begins with the words “COVID-19 TEST a FRAUD?”, then introduces the alleged quote from Mullis, who invented the PCR method in 1985 and was recognized for this achievement by being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 (here).\nThe context around the quote shows Lauritsen is not saying PCR tests do not work. Instead, he is clarifying that PCR identifies substances qualitatively not quantitatively, detecting the genetic sequences of viruses, but not the viruses themselves: “PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers.\nEven if Mullis had voiced a similar statement before his death in 2019, this quote does not mean the PCR test is unable to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - rather that it cannot determine whether the individual tested is infectious.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-08-31, is from Chequeado and states that there is no record of Kary Mullis, the creator of PCR tests, making a statement against their effectiveness.\n* Information 2, published on 2020-10-23, is from FullFact and explains that PCR tests are not designed to detect any type of infectious disease, but rather to pick up a signature of DNA and RNA of the person being tested.

In a new study in the Journal of Public Health, researchers from Queen Mary University of London and other U.K.-based institutions have expressed worry about these evident trends: “There is increasing concern over the higher rate of poor COVID-19 outcomes in BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] populations. Understanding potential drivers of this relationship is urgently needed to inform public health and research efforts.\nSpecialists express “increasing concern” over the fact that people of color and different ethnicities are at a higher risk of poor outcomes if they develop COVID-19. Preexisting diseases, vitamin D levels, or socioeconomic factors do not explain the disparities, they say.\nUntil researchers take an in-depth look at these and other possible underlying factors, outcome disparities for COVID-19 are bound to persist.

There have been increasing calls for research to better capture and report on socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes alongside race/ethnicity to identify populations that may experience a disproportionate burden of risk and/or ability to benefit from pandemic mitigation strategies.(10,13) We observed significant racial/ethnic disparities in ability to social distance as a measure of COVID exposure, susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and access to healthcare in our national cohort.\nMitigation strategies and messaging should intensify focus on Hispanic and Black NH individuals with conditions that increase risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and incorporate targeted, culturally appropriate communication. As with all observational studies, confounding of the exposure-outcome relationship is a concern, and we did not address the possibility of joint effects of the SEP indices.\nWe examined the relationship between each SEP index with COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or seroconversion), and we assessed race/ethnicity as a potential effect measure modifier (EMM) of the relationship between each SEP index and COVID-19 outcome.\nSecond, as the measure of COVID-19 susceptibility, we included conditions or behaviors that CDC has identified as increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications given SARS-CoV-2 infection: aged 60 years or older, daily smoking, and underlying chronic conditions (chronic lung disease, current asthma, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, immunocompromised condition, or HIV positive). Finally, as the measure of healthcare access, we included factors that affect medical care access: no primary care doctor, concerns about the costs of healthcare, concerns about seeing a doctor due to immigration status, or no health care coverage/insurance.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-08-17\nTitle: Racial Disparities in COVID-19: Key Findings from Available Data ...\nContent:\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing focus on its disproportionate impacts on people of color, particularly as availability of data to understand racial disparities has increased. This brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities.\nThis brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities. Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

Linked to this were constraints on people’s ability to work, seek support from loved ones and engage in their communities. Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression. Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking.\nLoneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression.

The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.\nOn 20 July 2015, Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life. Hawking created Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth, a documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World.\nThe impact of his celebrity status was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple. Hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.\nHis final words to the world appeared posthumously, in April 2018, in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel documentary entitled, Leaving Earth: Or How to Colonize a Planet.

She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it.

More than 170 countries are poised to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, the WHO reported last week. The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19.\nMore than 170 countries are poised to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, the WHO reported last week. The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19. The plan is backed by many U.S. allies, including Germany, Japan and the European Commission and appealed to some members of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. However, Trump has criticized the WHO for what he calls its “China-centric” response to the pandemic, so the U.S. won’t partner with the organization.\nWhen countries opt out, that makes it more difficult to meet the goals of lower vaccine costs, better health outcomes and fewer COVID-19 deaths, the newspaper reported. The decision also likely eliminates the chance that the U.S. could secure vaccine doses from a pool of vaccine candidates across the world. In reality, the vaccine development process will require a global supply chain to manufacture and distribute doses to people, including vaccine components such as syringes and vials.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-01\nTitle: US says it won't join global effort to find COVID-19 vaccine | AP News\nContent:\nThe decision to go it alone, first reported by The Washington Post, follows the White House’s decision in early July to pull the United States out of the WHO.

If a child has swallowed poison or tablets but doesn’t seem to be showing any adverse effects, you can obtain advice from the poisons database by calling 111. If they’re behaving strangely or experiencing any apparent symptoms after ingesting poison, call an ambulance immediately.\nIf an accident occurs on a playing field, nominate a member of staff to wait at the school entrance and lead the paramedics to the injured child.

The injured teacher was kept in the principal’s office with a wad of paper towels on her head for almost half an hour until most of the kids had been dropped off for the day and the buses had arrived.\nBack in my teaching days, during the year I worked in an elementary school, a teacher’s aide in the classroom for the most severely disabled kids in the entire district passed out. An ambulance was called immediately, and the principal got on the loudspeaker to tell everyone to stay in their classrooms/out of the hallways.

In this way, however, the problem is enormously underestimated.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Risk of COVID-19 due to Shortage of Personal Protective Equipment ...\nContent:\nThe supply of PPE is inadequate throughout the United States and the rest of the world [8-11]. This is especially true of N95 respirators for providers and even of surgical masks to be utilized by everyone. In some locations, the shortage is critical, forcing the providers to work under unsafe conditions. In part because of the shortage, the cost of PPE is high. Many hospitals are having difficulty paying for PPE.\nThere are many disputes between providers and hospitals regarding what is appropriate PPE in each setting. Many hospitals are requiring providers to reuse their own PPE that may no longer be sterile or protective. Some hospitals that do not provide adequate PPE still restrict the providers from using PPE they own and bring to the hospital.\nAlthough some providers have lived apart from their families, it is recommended that providers continue to stay at home with their families [33-35]. This preserves everyone’s mental health. Providers should carefully follow standard precautions including utilization of appropriate PPE at work and washing hands as indicated. On arriving home they may change clothes. They should avoid sharing utensils and items of personal use.\nAccording to unpublished accounts, as of 23rd April 2020, more than 21,800 U.S. providers had contracted COVID-19 and 71 had died. This very high risk causes psychological distress among the providers [5]. It is especially so among younger and more junior workers and those with dependent children [5]. Risk factors for providers contracting COVID-19 include inadequate handwashing, inadequate or improper use of PPE, and prolonged work hours and exposure [6].

Equally worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death3 partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.4\nThe situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million.1 The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilator\n\nInformation 1, published around May-July 2020, discusses the factors contributing to the PPE shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WHO's estimate of 10% global infection rate is misinterpreted, and the actual infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 is at least ten times higher than that of the flu. The global distribution, lack of vaccines, and potential long-term damage to survivors make COVID-19 more dangerous than the flu.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2022-07-29, provides information about the flu and COVID-19 from Johns Hopkins Medicine.

These changes are part of the rollout of Government efforts to reduce alcohol consumption under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-29, addresses a false claim that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has issued a strict ban on the consumption, sale, and purchase of alcohol.

Infectious <strong>disease</strong> expert Roy Chemaly, M.D., debunks some of the most common <strong>coronavirus</strong> myths.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-10-22\nTitle: What Temperature Kills Coronavirus (COVID-19)?\nContent:\nresearchers estimated that most coronaviruses would be almost completely killed after exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes. The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus. For temperatures above 65°C (149°F) is expected to cause near complete inactivation with exposures greater than 3 minutes. For temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that these findings agree with WHO guidelines which report a 4 log reduction of coronavirus for 56°C (133°F) with 15‐minute exposures 14 and is consistent with information for killing other infectious agents. 15\nHowever, for temperatures in the range 50‐55°C (122‐131°F) we recommend 20 minutes or longer of exposure. At these levels, we expect the viral concentration to be lowered by log 5‐7, near or below the detectable limit. Because of the seriousness of the current coronavirus infection, we suggest a reasonable safety factor can be obtained by increasing the above‐listed temperatures by 10°C (about 18 °F).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can just hot water kill the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that warm drinks, high ambient temperatures, and gargling warm water do not kill the virus. The claim that the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is also false, as the WHO states that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to several days.\n\nInformation 3, 4 and 5 also support the fact that the claim is false. Information 3 and 4 state that the virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more. Information 5 states that hot water alone cannot kill the virus on surfaces.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that warm drinks kill the coronavirus, the virus dies when the ambient temperature is higher than 26ºC, gargling warm water helps treat the disease and the virus stays on your hands for 10 minutes is false. The virus can be killed by exposure to temperatures of 65°C (149°F) or higher for longer than 3 minutes, and for temperatures between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) heating should last 20 minutes or more.

Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) continues to hit-hard on many countries across the world. Uganda reported its first case of COVID-19 on the March 21, 2020 (Coronavirus Disease, 2020).\nIn addition to the truck drivers, two cases of local transmission have been reported among Uganda Police Force officers, which may indicate an on-going community transmission of COVID-19. ... Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The confirmed case was a 36-year-old male who had travelled to Dubai on 17 March 2020 for a business trip. On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Savannah and the Atlanta suburb of East Point were joined Tuesday by Athens-Clarke County. At least three other Atlanta suburbs — Fairburn, South Fulton and Doraville, are considering the move. DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond said Tuesday that he believes a mask mandate in his large suburban county would leave police in a legally impossible position of going against state law, but at least one DeKalb County commissioner wants a vote on the issue anyway.\nThe Republican held a news conference Wednesday, July 1, 2020, before departing on a statewide tour to promote wearing a mask, but said he won’t mandate it. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) ATLANTA (AP) — Atlanta’s mayor has signed an executive order mandating masks in Georgia’s largest city, defying Gov.\nBrian Kemp’s decision to strongly encourage but not require face coverings. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms on Wednesday signed the order requiring masks, which could set up a confrontation with the Republican Kemp. The order goes into effect immediately. The governor has already clashed with the mayor recently over policing issues, calling out the National Guard to protect state government offices after an 8-year-old girl was fatally shot by armed people at the site of a fast food restaurant where an Atlanta police officer shot and killed a Black man.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on an official City of Atlanta website, details an executive order issued by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms requiring masks in public places, including private businesses and establishments, due to rising COVID-19 infections and the impact of the Delta variant. The order is in line with CDC guidance.\n\nInformation 2, published by a local news outlet, confirms the mandatory mask order issued by Mayor Bottoms, and mentions her previous statements that the city couldn't force people to wear masks due to state law. The article also mentions opposition to the mandate from some residents.\n\nInformation 3, published by a national news outlet, reports that Georgia Governor Brian Kemp issued an executive order banning local governments from mandating masks, and that Kemp's office stated that local mask mandates are unenforceable. The article mentions that Kemp's order was in response to Atlanta's mask mandate.\n\nInformation 4, published by a local news outlet, provides details of the Atlanta mask mandate, including exceptions for people with medical conditions or disabilities, and temporary mask removal for certain activities.\n\nInformation 5, published by a national news outlet, confirms the mandatory mask order issued by Mayor Bottoms and mentions potential confrontation with Governor Kemp. The article also mentions recent clashes between Kemp and Bottoms over policing issues.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that Atlanta Mayor Mandates Face Masks is true, as confirmed by multiple sources. However, it's worth noting that the mandatory mask order set up a confrontation with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who issued an executive order banning local governments from mandating masks. The City of Atlanta and Mayor Bottoms have continued to enforce the mask mandate despite Kemp's order.", "response": "TRUE."}

Former President Mahama bastardised these programmes with ghost names and dubious modules leading to flying Guinea Fowls.\nLadies and gentlemen of the media, stakeholders in our growing democracy and friends, despite pressing concerns to do with re-energising livelihoods, funding public infrastructure and services and putting people back to work in this difficult Covid-19 recovery period, we are being forced into a premature 2024 general election campaign by the posture and pronouncements of losing Candidate Mahama. We have to be ready. We have to respond. Many well-meaning Ghanaians and friends of Ghana worry that John Mahama’s attitude and words set Ghana back and so it’s critical that the NPP is ready. Former President John Mahama and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) is not the alternative.\nWhatever John Mahama is doing now is about John Mahama and his personal gain. We do not believe it’s about the people of Ghana because none of his sayings has a plan for Ghana. His track record in governance in Ghana shows that he is unable to help Ghana progress. Indeed, any would-be political leader of this era who refuses to recognise the true depth of social and economic stress imposed by Covid-19, seriously amplifying existing challenges, shows that he is only bent on taking power for his own purposes and not for Ghana.\nFinally, former President Mahama talks about corruption. He is asking Ghana to give him-the walking embodiment of corruption-the mandate to come and fight corruption. His solution to corruption fighting in his critical actions paper of 2012 was that he would lead by example.

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ...

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement.

If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit.

Based on these points alone, it seems a sauna can kill coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna can kill the novel coronavirus. The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

Initial studies implied that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors might increase the risk of viral infection and aggravate disease severity, thereby causing panic given the high global prevalence of hypertension. Nonetheless, subsequent evidence supported the administration of antihypertensive drugs and noted that they do not increase the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with hypertension, rather may have a beneficial effect.\nPreliminary data have shown that RAAS inhibitors upregulate ACE2 receptor expression in animal models, raising concerns about whether these drugs increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and result in poor clinical prognosis. Recent evidence suggests a negative association between the administration of RAAS blockers and the risk of COVID-19. Jiang et al examined whether hypertension or RAS suppression could regulate ACE2 levels.72 The results showed that ACE2 expression was increased in both the lungs and kidneys of older adults. Neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment altered ACE2 expression in the human kidney.\nThe prevalence of hypertension in Chinese patients with COVID-19 was estimated to be between 15% and 25%.8 In the United States, meanwhile, 49.7% of COVID-19–hospitalized patients had hypertension.9 It was reported that a 2-fold to 3-fold higher prevalence of hypertension was a risk for progression to critical illness or even death in the population.10,11 Pranata et al demonstrated that hypertension increased the likelihood of bad outcomes, such as the severity of infection, ARDS, and mortality in patients infected with COVID-19.12 · Presently, no specific drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19.\nThe use of ACEIs and ARBs was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization than the use of CCBs [hazard ratio, 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.83) and 0.84 (0.76–0.93), respectively] and a lower risk of intubation/death. Moreover, risks were slightly lower for ACEI users than for ARB users.75 · Therefore, clinical studies (Table ​(Table1)1) support the hypothesis that the administration of antihypertensive drugs does not enhance the severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-01\nTitle: Study Finds Link Between COVID and Risk for Hypertension – ...\nContent:\nCLEVELAND – Researchers are continuing to learn more about the long-term effects of COVID-19. Now, a new study shows the virus has been associated with a risk for developing hypertension, otherwise known as high blood pressure. “This study provides another important piece of evidence detailing the impact of COVID-19 on cardiometabolic health within the United States, particularly with blood pressure increases,” said Luke Laffin, MD, cardiologist for Cleveland Clinic.\nAccording to the study, at a six month follow up, hypertension was seen in about 20% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and nearly 11% of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Researchers also found those hospitalized with COVID-19 were twice as likely to develop hypertension than those who contracted influenza.\nResearchers also found those hospitalized with COVID-19 were twice as likely to develop hypertension than those who contracted influenza. In addition, hypertension was more common among older adults, males and individuals with preexisting health issues and those treated with certain medications. Dr. Laffin, who was not a part of the study, said it’s unclear why there’s a link between COVID-19 and hypertension.\nLaffin, who was not a part of the study, said it’s unclear why there’s a link between COVID-19 and hypertension. However, there are several possible theories. “The other question is what happens after a COVID-19 infection.

A scientific ...\nContent:\nThe viral structural spike (S) protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry to cells; this has led to suggestions that use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) may be implicated in poorer outcomes with COVID-19 [17, 18]. Whilst gaining much publicity, with attendant worry for patients and clinicians, this theory has been debated and ACE inhibitor and ARB treatment has also been associated with improved outcomes in some reports [19, 20]. Polymorphism in expression of the ACE2 receptor gene in association with hypertension and excess cardiovascular risk in ethnic minority groups has also been suggested as a partial explanation for observed excess mortality from COVID-19 in these populations [21, 22]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are currently undertaking a rapid review of this topic [23]. Recent observational studies of confirmed COVID-19 patients have increased confidence that these drugs are \nIt must also be acknowledged that these observational data carry risks of residual confounding [27]. One retrospective cohort study found a positive association between ACE inhibitor or ARB use and admission to hospital (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.38–2.71) or intensive care (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.07–2.51) in small subgroup analyses (N = 421 and 161, respectively) [26]. These secondary outcomes are rightly viewed with caution due to the potential for residual confounding by co-morbidity and also imprecision (as evidenced by wide confidence intervals) due to small sample sizes [28]. Nevertheless, these studies taken together convey a consistent message of absence of harm associated with anti-hypertensive medications during infection with coronavirus, and clinical equipoise should therefore apply. Whilst these drugs appear increasingly unlikely to worsen COVID-19 severity, the consequences of poor blood pressure control, under normal circumstances, are well documented [16]. Consequently, the British a\nHypertension is the single largest global contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost [1]. The majority of the population aged over 60 years have hypertension [2], and it has been suggested that they may be at increased risk from the effects of COVID-19. Despite this, and perhaps due to its ubiquity in the older population, current UK Government guidance does not identify people with hypertension as ʻat risk’ [3], however, other bodies such as the British Heart Foundation and the Health Service Executive in Ireland do [4, 5]. This article seeks to summarise and interpret the current evidence for and against an increase in COVID-19 risk and severity for those with raised blood pressure, and discusses the implications for the choice of anti-hypertensive treatment.\nJournal of Human Hypertension - COVID-19 and hypertension: risks and management.

Another study suggested that nifedipine and amlodipine significantly reduced the death rate and the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 [26]. Regarding the mortality rate and the length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, Nouri-Vaskeh et al. found no significant differences in the administration of losartan or amlodipine in COVID-19 patients with primary hypertension [27].\nTwo other studies concluded that using ACE inhibitors/ARBs was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization in hypertensive patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [51, 52]. Furthermore, prehospitalization and in-hospital use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs also had a protective role in treating this population [53, 54]. In Tian et al.'s study, the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs resulted in longer hospital stays [55]. In general, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued in hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [47, 56].\nSardu et al. found no significant differences in the study endpoints including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, cardiac injury, and deaths between patients in ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs groups [66]. Khera et al. reported that the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs did not increase the risk of hospitalization or mortality in individuals with hypertension [67]. Furthermore, a large cohort study also found no association between using ACE inhibitors and ARBs and an increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [68].\nYuan et al. reported that COVID-19 patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors had a lower risk of death, ICU admissions, and septic shock, and patients who used beta-blockers, CCBs, and diuretics did not show any significant difference compared with the patients with uncontrolled blood pressure [54]. Besides, the patients in the ACE inhibitors and ARBs group had lower IL-6 levels and peak viral load than patients treated with beta-blockers, CCBs, and diuretics [43]. In a detailed meta-analysis, Ren et al. also confirmed that the mortality and severity of COVID-19 were significantly lower in the patients taking ACE inhibitors/ARBs than in controls.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-05, is an article that discusses a new study appearing in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Multiple research studies and news reports show that patients were kept on ventilators in Italy, and there is no specific medicinal cure available yet.\n3. A video from May 26, 2020, claims that Italian doctors discovered that the coronavirus is not a virus but a bacteria causing blood clots, which can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants. However, this information is not accurate.\n4. A lengthy text message from June 11, 2020, making similar claims about Italy finding the cure for the coronavirus was fact-checked and found to be false.\n5. A fact-check article from May 1, 2020, states that the coronavirus is a virus, not a bacterium, and there is no evidence to support the claim that aspirin can cure or treat COVID-19.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that Italy has found the cure for the coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including Poynter, the Press Information Bureau (India), and various fact-checking articles, have debunked this claim.

As of July 2021, at least nine different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19. Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection, since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses.\nSince January 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.

The isolation of this mystifying virus and phylogenetic examination demonstrated close similarity with SARS-CoV virus that appeared in year 2002-03 and hence refereed as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2” (SARS-CoV-2) [9]. As of now (May 31, 2020) almost 61,83,559 cases have been confirmed with COVID-19 with almost 3,71,364 fatalities around the world (in 212 countries) [10]. Till date no approved treatment is available for curing COVID-19, based on the drug repurposing and in-vitro inhibition strategy various drugs such as acyclovir, chloroquine, ganciclovir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ganciclovir and ritonavir are used to treat COVID-19, however none of the drug is approved by the FDA for the COVI\nRepurposing of the drug: There is no approved treatment as well as no approved drug is available for the COVID-19 till date [2,17]. Repositioning of the drug is the strategy that is applied for the treatment of COVID-19 based on in-vitro inhibition analysis and antiviral mechanism [2,3]. However, use of random drugs for COVID-19 treatment may develop resistance power of pathogen, may have lethal and detrimental side effects which restricts the direct use of anti-viral drugs and knock the door for designing of vaccine (as a better and safer option) [3,17].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccinations - Our World in Data\nContent:\nOn each chart of this page, therefore we choose a default selection of countries based on a mix of criteria: mainly total population, but also the number of doses administered and share of the population vaccinated.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions.

The stockpile is running low. The Trump administration admits it. And no, this is not the states’ fault. But it’s not entirely clear what will happen when it’s emptied out.\nThe Strategic National Stockpile, like the nuclear arsenal, is something government officials hoped they would never need to use. Formed in 1999 as anxiety over Y2K mounted, this federal stockpile was designed to prevent an interruption to hospital supply chains, if all the computers ended up melting down on New Year’s Eve. That never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security.\nThat never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security. If a bioweapon struck an American city, for example, officials could quickly access vaccines and antitoxins to fight back against nerve agents or diseases like smallpox.\nSince then, the office of the Strategic National Stockpile has been preparing for the next outbreak, though no one knew when or what it would be. With an annual budget of about $600 million, the stockpile has maintained a large supply of personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, face shields, and surgical gowns, as well as medical equipment like the ventilators that hospitals so urgently need now to treat Covid-19 patients.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-06\nTitle: Depleted National Stockpile Contributed to COVID PPE Shortage: ‘You\nContent:\nWhen asked why the SNS didn’t receive appropriations for fully replacing the stockpile following H1N1, he says: “You’d really have to ask the Congress.” · As the documentary finds, sources both inside and outside the government had raised alarms, pre-COVID, about leaving the nation and its front-line health care workers without a PPE safety net.\nOver seven months of interviewing manufacturers and government officials, analyzing records and tracking key medical supplies, AP investigative reporters Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza, along with producer Peter Klein of the Global Reporting Centre and his team, found missed opportunities to prevent that failure stretching across several presidential administrations — including chances to invest in domestic manufacturing rather than relying on supplies made in China, as well as neglecting to substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. Intended as a fallback for covering medical-equipment needs in times of crises, the SNS is a set of government-run warehouses filled with medical supplies, such as ventilators and N95 respirator masks. The Obama administration distributed those supplies on a mass scale during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. “During H1N1, we sent out personal protective equipment that we had stocked for a pandemic influenza event, ahead of a great deal o\n\"America’s Medical Supply Crisis,\" a new documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Global Reporting Centre, examines missed opportunities to fend off a deadly PPE shortage.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-02\nTitle: Coronavirus: Protective gear in national stockpile is nearly ...\nContent:\nHe also said large amounts of PPE were being shipped directly from manufacturers to hospitals. But the DHS officials said the stockpile has not been able to handle the load. President Trump said on March 28 that the United States will “absolutely” have enough ventilators in wake of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the shortage.\nThe government has long viewed the national stockpile supplies as a holdover during an emergency so the government could buy time for manufacturers to boost output and for new supply chains to solidify, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.\nAs coronavirus hot spots flare from coast to coast, the demand for safety equipment — also known as personal protective equipment (PPE) — is both immediate and widespread, with health officials, hospital executives and governors saying that their shortages are critical and that health-care workers are putting their lives at risk while trying to help the surging number of patients. Two DHS officials said the stores kept in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Strategic National Stockpile are nearly gone.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-11-23, discusses the issues with PPE production and how the US is unable to meet its goals of filling the Strategic National Stockpile.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.

The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year.

U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years.

County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.

Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23.

Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Morandi tried to manoeuvre but the vessel was boarded by hundreds of invaders, in which he ordered that the vessel to be set on fire. He was later killed by rain of hostile bullets. However, all on board were eventually mutilated and killed. On 8 March 1799, General Belliard led his forces to fight 3,000 Meccan Infantry and 350 Mamluks in the plain of Abnud, located on the right bank of the Nile to the south of Qena.\nNevertheless, Egypt became a topic of debate between Talleyrand and Napoleon, which continued in their correspondence during Napoleon's Italian campaign. In early 1798, Bonaparte proposed an expedition to Egypt and convinced the Directory to establish the Commission des Sciences et des Arts.\nAccording to a 13 February report by Talleyrand, \"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send force from Suez to the Sultanate of Mysore, to join the forces of Tipu Sultan and drive away the English.\" The Directory agreed to the plan in March, though troubled by its scope and cost.\nBonaparte had been informed that Murad Bey had evaded the pursuit by Generals Desaix, Belliard, Donzelot and Davout and was descending on Lower Egypt. Bonaparte thus marched to attack him at Giza, also learning that 100 Ottoman ships were off Aboukir, threatening Alexandria.\nThe French campaign in Egypt and Syria (1798–1801) was a Napoleonic campaign in the Ottoman territories of Egypt and Syria, executed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon proclaimed to \"defend French trade interests\" and to establish \"scientific enterprise\" in the region.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-07\nTitle: Italian official to visit Egypt, renews Rome's affirmation of ...\nContent:\nCAIRO- 7 March 2023: Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Antonio Tajani stressed, Tuesday, the need to move forward with the two-state solution regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, noting that he will head to Egypt next week, according to the Italian Nova Agency.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-07-31, provides details about how to say \"cheers\" in Italian and Italian toasting etiquette.

The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nYou might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.\nIn January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: Scientists find COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly\nContent:\nBy clicking \"Allow All\" you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage and support us in providing free open access scientific content.

Previous findings indicate that antibodies to those viruses last at least a year and often longer, they said. In combination with certain previous findings on COVID-19 antibodies, the researchers concluded that their results \"might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 'immunity passports' and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups and widespread testing.\"\nAmid Omicron, relative to participants without long COVID, those with long COVID at 2 years had significantly higher rates of reinfection and pneumonia. ...

The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nIn the recent study published in Science, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a database of immune responses from 30,000 New Yorkers who tested positive for the coronavirus between March and October and monitored 121 volunteers over time.\nIn the U.K. study, scientists at Imperial College London found that antibody prevalence in the British participants fell from 6 percent at roughly the end of June to 4.4 percent in September. And using at-home tests that were distributed to more than 365,000 people, the researchers observed a more than 26 percent decline in antibody levels over three months.\nBut despite the seemingly divergent results from the two studies, they can both be true, according to Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the molecular microbiology and immunology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not unreasonable — or particularly alarming — if antibody levels decline rapidly after a person recovers and then persist for some time at a much lower level, he said.\nBelgian student Lili Deneve, who has recovered from Covid-19, donates plasma at the Belgian Red Cross blood collection center in Brussels on Oct. 27, 2020.Francois Lenoir / Reuters ...

Unlike ART test kits — which look for the presence of viral proteins produced during a Covid-19 infection to determine if a person is infected — this rapid point-of-care test kit is a serology test that measures antibodies made by the patient.\nThis will help allay some people’s fears that they will be ‘over-vaccinated with a booster,’ since the results will inform them accurately if they are well-protected against Covid-19 or not.” · In their research paper, the team describes a clinical study of their cellulose pulled-down virus neutralization test kit (cpVNT), a neutralizing antibody blood test designed to assess an individual’s immunoprotective profile against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. With a drop of finger-prick blood, the test kit can evaluate an individual’s neutralizing antibody level against a specific Covid-19 variant within 10 minutes, making this an efficient, low-cost, and easy-to-use tool that will enable large-scale testing and can be widely deployed anywhere as part of a personalized vaccination strategy.\n\nInformation 1, published on December 20, 2022, explains what COVID-19 antibody testing is and how it helps determine if a person had a past infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Prior to that, only a few isolated cases had been seen on the island. Internationally, vaccines existed for meningitis types A and C, but not for type B.\nCuban health authorities secured a vaccine from a French pharmaceutical company to immunise the population against type C meningitis. However, in the following years, cases of type B began to rise. A team of specialists from different medical science centres was established, led by a woman biochemist, Concepción Campa, to work intensively on finding a vaccine.\nBy 1984, meningitis B had become the most serious health problem in Cuba. After six years of intense work, Campa’s team produced the world’s first successful meningitis B vaccine in 1988. A member of Campa’s team, Dr Gustavo Sierra recalled their joy:\nBetween 1989 and 1990, the three million Cubans most at risk were vaccinated. Subsequently, 250,000 young people were vaccinated with the VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine, a combined vaccine for meningitis types B and C.

The man in the video inhales and exhales through two different surgical masks, a cupped mask, a cloth mask, a mask with filter material and a respirator with a valve.\n“I am disappointed that a licensed physician would use smoke as an equivalent comparison,” said Hogue, although as noted above, Noel’s license has expired. Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in aerosols, said in an email: “I consider that video disinformation because they clearly don’t know what they are doing with that test.” · The effectiveness of masks in limiting the potential spread of coronavirus has been extensively documented.\nA YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus. This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cloth masks do not stop smoke particles, still effective against ...\nContent:\nParsons recommends wearing cloth and surgical masks to curb the spread of COVID-19 in wildfire areas even if they do not protect against smoke particles. This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nAP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus. On the page titled “Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19,” the agency said that cloth masks would not protect anyone from wildfire smoke. “Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through ...\nContent:\nThe home scenario fits the indoor conditions that large numbers of vapers and smokers (and their families) must endure for a range of large periods under home confinement in which face masks are not usually worn. The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free. We discuss this issue in Section 7.2.

The video carries the headline: \"Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’\" But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-05, is a fact-check by AFP stating that a video showing a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks to demonstrate their ineffectiveness against the coronavirus is false. The video originated from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The man in the video is identified as a licensed physician with an expired license. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2021-02-06, is an article by AFP reporting on a doctor with an expired license who falsely claimed that masks don't work. The article mentions a video from September 6, 2020, where the doctor uses vape aerosols to show the ineffectiveness of masks. The article also states that experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by the Associated Press stating that cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask. The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Masks do help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

There would have been approximately 80% fewer COVID-19 deaths in the United States by March 29, 2020, if the country had employed mandatory BCG vaccination since at least 2000, according to the new research.\nIn their analysis, the scientists also tried to account for other factors that could have affected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections. We investigated whether a previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical progression of COVID-19 A case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil.\nA case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil. Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nOur analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19. One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.\nMandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19 · Martha K.

Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19\n\nThe claim that mandatory BCG vaccination may slow the spread of COVID-19 is supported by the information provided. The research studies and data presented in the information suggest a significant association between mandatory BCG vaccination and a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. This effect is substantial, with the model estimating that the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in the United States as of March 29, 2020, would have been 19% of the actual figure if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier.\n\nThe information also discusses potential confounding factors, such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, which have been considered and excluded as much as possible in the epidemiological studies. However, it is important to note that the results from ecological studies are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive.\n\nFurther research is needed to confirm the hypothesis and establish a causal relationship between BCG vaccination and the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, the current evidence suggests a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.

The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year. We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread. The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004.\nViral posts on social media claim COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in \"every election year,\" suggesting that the new coronavirus is being \"hyped\" to hurt President Donald Trump. But most of the dates cited to defend those conclusions about previous outbreaks are misleading or incorrect.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* The claim that every election year has a disease is false and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations including Reuters, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org.\n* The claim lists various diseases such as SARS, avian flu, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus, and matches them up to election years since 2004.\n* However, most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns.\n* Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years.\n* While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n* The claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nThe claim that every election year has a disease is false. Most of the diseases listed in the claim were discovered and spread before the election years and were minimally mentioned during campaigns. Some of the diseases, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, had virtually no effect on the U.S. during election years. While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons. However, the evidence shows that most of the diseases listed in the claim had little to no impact on U.S. elections and were not directly linked to election years.", "response": "FALSE."}

Two tests were positive for COVID-19 infection. Since then, the number of infected persons in Brazil has increased dramatically [14]. Physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 16th [5]. Events expected to attract large numbers of people were cancelled, universities and schools were closed, and only services considered essential to the population remained functional, such as markets, pharmacies and bakeries.\nTo document how the containment measures affected the lives of the Brazilian people, and to understand which containment measures were best adhered to by which strata of the population, we conducted an online survey on the adherence of the Brazilian people to individual public health measures and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives.\nIn another large online survey in Brazil conducted between April 24th and May 24th, assessing only the degree of adherence to physical contact restriction measures, greater adherence was found among females compared to males but it was mainly the 30 to 49 year old group that was less adherent and not the younger age group [23]. People living in rural areas and poor neighborhoods were also less adherent: in rural areas people may not perceive themselves at high risk of COVID-19, and therefore may not respect the national restriction measures and not practice individual hygiene measures [24]. Therefore, extra communication and health education may be needed to change the risk perception in rural areas and popular neighborhoods [25]. Brazilian students reported difficulties to stay home, which may be related to a need to travel to their original homes in periods when schools and universities were closed [26] or could be related to differing social habits among this population.\nThis is a concern, as older age and the presence of (an) underlying health condition(s) are associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality [30, 31] On the other hand, Brazilian respondents with underlying diseases adhered better to the containment measures.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil's COVID-19 guidelines: political hijack of public health ...\nContent:\nBahia School of Medicine and Public Health, Salvador 40290-000, BrazilSearch for articles by this author ...

In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two Rare Neurologic Conditions Linked to COVID-19\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24]. Vitamin C has many properties that make it a valuable therapeutic agent for respiratory infections.\nThis may provide timely data on the possible preventive and therapeutic values of vitamin C for medical and public interest in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
