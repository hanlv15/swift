There would have been approximately 80% fewer COVID-19 deaths in the United States by March 29, 2020, if the country had employed mandatory BCG vaccination since at least 2000, according to the new research.\nIn their analysis, the scientists also tried to account for other factors that could have affected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections. We investigated whether a previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical progression of COVID-19 A case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil.\nA case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil. Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nOur analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19. One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.\nMandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19 · Martha K. Berg, Qinggang Yu, Cristina E. Salvador, Irene Melani, Shinobu Kitayama · medRxiv 2020.04.05.20054163; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054163 ... Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19\n\nThe claim that mandatory BCG vaccination may slow the spread of COVID-19 is supported by the information provided. The research studies and data presented in the information suggest a significant association between mandatory BCG vaccination and a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. This effect is substantial, with the model estimating that the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in the United States as of March 29, 2020, would have been 19% of the actual figure if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier.\n\nThe information also discusses potential confounding factors, such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, which have been considered and excluded as much as possible in the epidemiological studies. However, it is important to note that the results from ecological studies are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive.\n\nFurther research is needed to confirm the hypothesis and establish a causal relationship between BCG vaccination and the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, the current evidence suggests a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.", "response": "TRUE."}

Emissions of nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, fell drastically in northern Italy during the lockdowns, and a reduction of 50% of movement between provinces and of 19% of personal interactions was calculated. On March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a national lockdown or quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances.\n\nClaim verification:\n\nThe claim, published on April 27, 2020, states that the only restaurant allowed to be open during the lockdown for COVID-19 is the one for Italian senators and representatives. However, the provided information does not support this claim. Instead, the information shows that Italian restaurants have been subject to various restrictions and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic but have not been exclusively open for Italian senators and representatives.

(There were differences among the vaccines, with Moderna’s primary series of two shots showing the highest effectiveness of 62% one month after the series, and Sinovac’s demonstrating the lowest effectiveness at 32%.) After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. FACT: Vaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected.

However, now the first evidence is emerging · On 1 April, Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time. The studies did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-09-27, explains how vaccines work and debunks myths about COVID-19 vaccines.

He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. The virus has since claimed at least 425 lives and sickened more than 20,000 people globally – including Li.\nIn the early hours of December 31, Wuhan’s health authorities held an emergency meeting to discuss the outbreak. Afterwards, Li was summoned by officials at his hospital to explain how he knew about the cases, according to state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily. Later that day, the Wuhan authorities announced the outbreak and alerted the World Health Organization.\nOn January 10, after unwittingly treating a patient with the Wuhan coronavirus, Li started coughing and developed a fever the next day.

She also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer.\nShe also had bouts with pancreatic and lung cancer. It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it. A decade later came a new diagnosis, pancreatic cancer, discovered early because the jurist was still undergoing regular screening because of her first cancer.

The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\nYou might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.\nIn January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: Scientists find COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly\nContent:\nBy clicking \"Allow All\" you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyse site usage and support us in providing free open access scientific content.

The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nIn the recent study published in Science, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a database of immune responses from 30,000 New Yorkers who tested positive for the coronavirus between March and October and monitored 121 volunteers over time.\nIn the U.K. study, scientists at Imperial College London found that antibody prevalence in the British participants fell from 6 percent at roughly the end of June to 4.4 percent in September. And using at-home tests that were distributed to more than 365,000 people, the researchers observed a more than 26 percent decline in antibody levels over three months.\nBut despite the seemingly divergent results from the two studies, they can both be true, according to Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the molecular microbiology and immunology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not unreasonable — or particularly alarming — if antibody levels decline rapidly after a person recovers and then persist for some time at a much lower level, he said.\nBelgian student Lili Deneve, who has recovered from Covid-19, donates plasma at the Belgian Red Cross blood collection center in Brussels on Oct. 27, 2020.Francois Lenoir / Reuters ...

Some posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ).\nBy mid-March, factory production data continued to underscore the impact of the pandemic on the country, as Chinese stocks fell again to six-week lows, ( here ). The claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the virus is therefore untrue. As it begins to ease its strict coronavirus curbs, China has urged authorities to pay more attention to asymptomatic cases, as part of efforts to allay public fears that large numbers of infectious people have gone unreported. Residents and medical staff in Wuhan told Reuters that testing problems at some hospitals meant that some infected people were not identified, and thus were not included in official data.\nSome posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ). Some posts go on to include further claims alluding to a possible conspiracy by the Chinese government and Democratic party members in the U.S. to financially cripple America and negatively frame President Donald Trump’s administration.

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease. It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins. The study also predicts how a key entry protein is regulated with other immune system genes and reveals potential targets for the development of treatments to reduce transmission.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I. Estimates of the number of deaths from the pandemic range from 21 million to 50 million worldwide.

The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated.

That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe.

This virus appears to have originated within Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17,18,19. In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705). Samples were stored in viral transport medium at −80 °C directly after collection.\nIn 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. This emerging human virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, and also appears to have originated in horseshoe bats20,21—with its full genome 96% similar to a viral sequence reported from Rhinolophus affinis20. Closely related sequences were also identified in Malayan pangolins22,23. A growing body of research has identified bats as the evolutionary sources of SARS—and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—CoVs13,14,24,25,26, and as the source of progenitors for the human CoVs, NL63 and 229E27,28.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-01-30\nTitle: False: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the ...\nContent:\nExplanation: The current analysis indicate that there is no <strong>pig</strong> element in <strong>the</strong> <strong>virus</strong>. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Wuhan</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> originated mostly from SARS <strong>and</strong> <strong>bats</strong>, not from <strong>pigs</strong>.

Pigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species.\nPigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species. Moreover, a team at Zhejiang University in the Chinese city of Hangzhou found that the SADS virus could infect cells from many organisms in a petri dish, including rodents, chickens, nonhuman primates and humans.

Nonetheless, civets may have amplified the virus and brought it closer to humans (35). Additional mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, common marmosets, grivets, and cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be infected under experimental inoculation, seroconvert, and display similar pathological signs as humans, and the monkeys and guinea pigs usually display mild clinical signs, while cats and golden hamsters show no clinical signs (36–44).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study conducted by Tufts University and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences found that bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection.

The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells.\nThe loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose.

Researchers are intent on finding out why. “For almost every infectious disease, the most vulnerable populations are at the extremes of age — the very young and the very old,” said Stanford Medicine professor of microbiology and immunology and of pathology Bali Pulendran, PhD. “But with COVID-19, the young are spared while the old are emphatically not.\nThe scientists pivoted to a study of COVID-19 in kids. Florian Wimmers, PhD, then a postdoc in Pulendran’s lab, and his colleagues got hold of nasal and blood samples collected from 54 infants who’d become infected with SARS-CoV-2 before reaching age 2, and from 27 other children who’d tested negative throughout the observation period. For comparison, the researchers obtained similar samples from several dozen adults. All infected children in the study were, at most, mildly symptomatic.\nAnother difference: In the blood of adults with even mild COVID-19 cases, there was a big increase in levels of a number of inflammation-promoting signaling proteins, previously shown to be associated with more-severe symptoms. In infected kids’ blood, this increase wasn’t seen.\nPulendran wants to see if any of this nasal magic extends beyond COVID-19 — he is now collaborating with the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital group on influenza and other viruses. He suspects that his COVID-19 findings may not translate directly to other respiratory infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 in Early Life: Infants and Children Are Affected Too - PMC\nContent:\nThis meta-analysis revealed that 3.2% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had positive nasopharyngeal tests after birth (19). The virus was also detected in the cord blood and placenta and fecal or rectal swabs of neonates. Among cases where serology was tested, 3.7% was confirmed positive based on the presence of immunoglobulin M. These results have come mostly from case reports, and there is still not consensus over whether SARS-CoV-2 is vertically transmitted via the placenta to the fetus.\nAlthough COVID-19 infection is most commonly asymptomatic or mild in children, severe disease can occur as well. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37). Older children are also more likely to present with symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell (38).\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37).

In a systematic review of 7,780 pediatric patients (40), mortality was low at 0.09% but severe disease was seen mostly in children with underlying conditions (35.6%) and immunosuppression (30.5%). In a case series from China of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 4% of children were asymptomatic, 51% had mild illness, 39% had moderate illness, and 6% had severe illness (41).\n\nInformation 1, 3, and 5 provide details about a study on the outcomes of infants born to mothers infected with COVID-19. The study, conducted by researchers at UC San Francisco and part of the PRIORITY project, found that most infants are well even when their mothers are infected by COVID-19. Among 263 infants in the study, adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, NICU admission, and respiratory disease did not differ between those born to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those born to mothers testing negative.

It’s Too Late\nContent:\nThen in June, some claimed that it was \"the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19\". In July, 239 scientists signed an open letter appealing to the medical community and governing bodies to recognize the potential risk of airborne transmission. That same month (by coincidence, not as a result of the letter), WHO released a new scientific brief on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that stated:\nOver a year since declaring Covid-19 a pandemic, the World Health Organization has finally admitted that Coronavirus is airborne. Aerosol researchers started warning that \"the world should face the reality\" of airborne transmission in April 2020. Then in June, some claimed that it was \"the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19\".\nMany people think Trump was trying to shift the blame for his poor handling of the pandemic to a scapegoat, criticizing WHO for \"severely mismanaging and covering up\" the spread of Covid-19 and mistakes that \"pushed China's misinformation.\" Others believe that blaming WHO is not scapegoating because there's some merit to Trump's criticism.\nWHO failed to consider that practical advice — to recommend that the public use caution and wear face masks to block airborne droplets — has no major downsides when compared to the alternative, which is to potentially allow people to spread Covid.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-07-09\nTitle: Modes of transmission of virus causing COVID-19: implications for ...\nContent:\nRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7\nAs evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play in transmission.  · Based on the available evidence, including the recent publications mentioned above, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. WHO continues to recommend airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures and support treatment are performed, according to risk assessment.13 These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine14 and those currently used in Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom.15-17\nAt the same time, other countries and organizations, including the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients, and consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3).18-19\nTransmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).  · Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-04-29\nTitle: A guideline to limit indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19\nContent:\nAirborne transmission was also implicated in the COVID-19 outbreak between residents of a Korean high-rise building whose apartments were linked via air ducts (30). Studies have also confirmed the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in respiratory aerosols (31) suspended in air samples collected at distances as large as 16 ft from infected patients in a hospital room (3). Further evidence for the dominance of indoor airborne transmission has come from an analysis of 7,324 early cases outside the Hubei Province, in 320 cities across mainland China (32).\nNext, we illustrate the value of our guideline in contact tracing (82), specifically, in prescribing the scope of the testing of people with whom an infected index case has had close contact. The CDC presently defines a COVID-19 “close contact” as any encounter in which an individual is within 6 ft of an infected person for more than 15 min. Fig. 3 makes clear that this definition may grossly underestimate the number of individuals exposed to a substantial risk of airborne infection in indoor spaces.\nAirborne transmission arises through the inhalation of aerosol droplets exhaled by an infected person and is now thought to be the primary transmission route of COVID-19. By assuming that the respiratory droplets are mixed uniformly through an indoor space, we derive a simple safety guideline for mitigating airborne transmission that would impose an upper bound on the product of the number of occupants and their time spent in a room.\nThe importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2021-04-16\nTitle: 10 reasons why the coronavirus is airborne: Study | Mint\nContent:\nThe team highlighted research estimating that silent (asymptomatic or presymptomatic) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission. This silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, \"supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,\" according to the assessment.\nThis silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, \"supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,\" according to the assessment. The researchers also cited work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels; people who were never in each other's presence.\nColorado: According to a new assessment published today in the medical journal Lancet there is consistent, strong evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is predominantly transmitted through the air. Therefore, public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread, according to six experts from the UK, USA and Canada, including Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado Boulder.\nThe team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trish Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-04-21\nTitle: 10 Signs Airborne Coronavirus Spread is What Matters\nContent:\nIn February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It's likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn't know it.\nWith COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease.\nSome children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.\nDoctors and health officials use this term when they don't know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven't been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 9, 2021, discusses the World Health Organization (WHO) finally acknowledging the airborne transmission of COVID-19.

In this case, it’s seamless merging of fact and fantasy. All of the 19 CEOs in the meme have, in fact, stepped down from their posts. That’s not fake. But their departures had nothing to do with coronavirus, and many took place long before the first COVID-19 cluster was identified.\nAccording to Business Insider, the CEO of the tobacco company Altria, Howard Willard, resigned due to complications from contracting the illness; while the head of SeaWorld recently resigned due to the financial hit the park was taking from having to close down; and there are rumors that Disney head Bob Iger unexpectedly stepped down over a year before his planned retirement because he knew how bad the pandemic would be. And there’s another conspiracy that Q believers have ignored entirely—one that’s already been proven to have come true.\nSo yes, while more CEOs have resigned in the last few years than since the Great Recession, most were in the works long before the coronavirus pandemic hit. They had nothing to do with the actual pandemic—and not the behind-the-scenes war between good and evil that Q believers talk about. The real conspiracies—be it insider trading or that “man of the people” Donald Trump made a great number of rich people more wealthy who are now they are cashing out before things collapse—apparently just isn’t as fun.\nAnd we’re all too distracted by the torrent of pandemic headlines to realize what’s really going on here: Deep state-aligned industry titans are running for the hills before they’re brought down by President Donald Trump and his team of patriots.

Parker had served as an airline CEO for 20 years. The company’s president, Robert Isom, will take over on March 31. Parker will serve as Chairman of the carrier’s board. “It likely would have happened sooner, but the global pandemic — and the devastating impact it had on our industry — delayed those plans,” Parker stated in a note to his employees.\nOn January 20, 2021, Michael Pack, CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media including Voice of America resigned at President Biden’s request, two hours after being sworn in. Often accused for partisanship, Pack pointed fingers at journalists for anti-Trump bias. He initiated investigations into bias claims and tried to sack senior “deep state” executives.\nUnfortunately, many CEO’s are misaligned with corporate objectives. Some make poor or even fatal decisions under stress. Others allow their character flaws to spin out of control. Too many CEO’s sabotage their own best efforts and fail to bring their best selves to the workplace. They can experience untold embarrassment, despair, and untimely resignations.\nSilbermann shared “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see… Bill is a great leader for this transition.” · On June 22, 2022, Jose Mauro Coelho, the CEO of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras stepped down. His resignation occurred amidst political pressure from lawmakers and President Jair Bolsonaro due to rising fuel prices.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 are from the same source and provide details about a Facebook post made by Cody Harris on March 12, 2020. The post claimed that a series of CEO resignations before the novel coronavirus outbreak were linked to a global conspiracy. The post was debunked as false by fact-checkers, who pointed out that there was no evidence to support the claim and that many of the CEOs mentioned had not actually stepped down from their positions.\n\nInformation 3 is about a different claim, made in December 2021, that a series of high-level corporate resignations were linked to the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. This claim was also debunked as false by fact-checkers, who found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the claim made by Cody Harris. It explains that while some of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim were real, they had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or any global conspiracy. Instead, they were due to a variety of factors, including personal health issues and company financial problems.\n\nInformation 5 is not directly related to the claim made by Cody Harris, but it provides some general context about CEO resignations. It notes that some CEOs resign due to poor decision-making, character flaws, or political pressure.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim made by Cody Harris that CEO resignations are linked to a global conspiracy is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and many of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim have been debunked as false.

At the time of revising this manuscript in January 2021, many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by an easier spread of COVID-19 in winter.\nIn sum, we show that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the threat of epidemic resurgence may increase during winter.

The claim originated from an anonymous letter stating that the virus can be fought off by eating chillies and ginger and can be destroyed at temperatures of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2018-01-25, explains that cold weather does not directly make people sick, and the misconception may come from the fact that people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other when it's cold, which can facilitate the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-11, states that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive and spread in warm climates, citing Singapore and Africa as examples where the virus has spread despite warm temperatures.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a study that examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for several confounding factors.

The virus can survive and spread in warm climates, as evidenced by outbreaks in countries such as Singapore and Africa. Additionally, a study found that an increase in absolute latitude is associated with a higher number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates.

While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus.

Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles. As a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued. In addition, the date of vaccination should be recorded in the medical record of patients. Several practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported.\nSeveral practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported. These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.\nThe time elapsed since the last COVID-19 vaccination may need to be considered when invasive procedures are required.

The articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.”\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others shows the vaccines boost the immune response. The mRNA vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, allowing it to generate an immune response, experts say.\nThe articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.” · But that’s not at all what the research shows, according to the Francis Crick Institute’s Dr. David Bauer, one of the study’s authors. “Our work to date has not studied T cells at all,” Bauer told the AP in an email. “All research published to date shows that the Pfizer (and other) vaccines generate a strong, positive, protective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2.” · Outside experts confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy or damage T cells.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-15, is a fact-check by Maldita.es stating that there has been no discovery that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-27, discusses a study that found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 and then vaccinated had lower levels of CD8 cells, a type of T cell, compared to those who were vaccinated and had not been infected.

On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: San José del Guaviare Jorge E.

The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. One week later an Italian man repatriated to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalized and confirmed as the third case in Italy. Clusters of cases were later detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February, with the first deaths on 22 February.\nThe majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters. On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in lockdown. On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and restricted movement of people.\nOn 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak. In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas: The number of new cases and deaths per day in Italy from COVID-19 showing the effects of lockdown and lifting\nThe governor of Basilicata, Vito Bardi, instituted a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people arriving from areas in Northern Italy affected by the outbreak. The Ministry of Health announced that it had engaged 31 laboratories in Italy to carry out the analysis of swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases.

But Italy could have given itself a better chance to contain the wave if it had built more labs across the country, performing granular surveillance of hot-spot neighborhoods and workplaces, at the first beginning of the uptick. Crisanti said Italy should have been testing 400,000 people per day at the end of the summer when it was instead testing 75,000. The summer heightened the dangers for what Italians call the “rientro” — the post-holiday return to city life.\nHospitals now have more protective gear, more ventilators and more intensive-care capacity than in the spring. But Italy’s breakdown came in an earlier line of defense: Contact tracers increasingly struggled to identify and isolate infected people before the virus spread through communities. ... The contact-tracing system “crumbled as soon as we exceeded 1,000 cases per day,” said Andrea Crisanti, a virologist at the University of Padua who advised the Veneto region in the spring.\nSeveral European scientists, including in Italy, made the case that the virus had weakened, a minority scientific position that nonetheless captured attention with summer hospitalization rates so low. Italy had given itself one of the best chances among European countries to sustainably contain the virus after the spring crisis. Its emergence from the March and April lockdown had been anything but swift or reckless, with new reopenings coming at two-week intervals to gauge their riskiness.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had said in August that the country would be able to deal with any future increases in cases without limits on “economic activity.” · All along, some degree of resurgence was inevitable — especially as the weather cooled and people began to socialize more indoors. But Italian health officials had reasoned that a second wave wouldn’t be nearly as severe as the first. Hospitals were more prepared.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-02-01, states that the first COVID-19 case in Italy was confirmed on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-12-30, confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in Lombardy and Veneto on 21 February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 9 March 2020.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, published on 2020-04-22 and without a specific date, provide real-time updates on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-11-09, states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. The article also mentions that hospitals were more prepared for a second wave of the virus, but the contact-tracing system had already crumbled.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true. The pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, which occurred in February and March 2020, as the country struggled to cope with the sudden surge of cases. However, the claim does not mention any specific date or context for the pictures.\n\nThe information published on 2021-02-01 and 2023-12-30 confirms that the first COVID-19 cases in Italy were detected in February 2020, and the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 8 March 2020. Therefore, it is possible that the pictures in question were taken during the first wave of the virus in Italy.\n\nHowever, the information published on 2020-11-09 states that Italy's contact-tracing system struggled to identify and isolate infected people as the number of daily cases exceeded 1,000. This suggests that the situation in Italy had worsened again by November 2020, and the country was facing a second wave of the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that pictures of people stranded on hospital beds are Italians not coping with the pressures of COVID-19 cases is partially true, it does not provide enough context or evidence to support the claim. The available information suggests that the pictures could be from the first wave of the virus in Italy, but it is also possible that they are from a later stage of the pandemic when the country was facing a second wave of the virus.

According to Information 1 and 2, which were published on the same date as the claim, 113 people under the age of 65 had died of COVID-19 in Ireland at that time. The claim is therefore misleading as it omits crucial details about the number of deaths in this age group. Information 3 provides further context, stating that the Central Statistics Office's analysis of confirmed deaths has found that COVID-19 has had the greatest impact on people aged 65 or over, with almost 92% of confirmed deaths occurring within this age group. Information 4 and 5 do not contain relevant information to the claim.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim is false based on Information 1 and 2, which state that 113 people under the age of 65 had died of COVID-19 in Ireland at the time the claim was made. This is significantly more than the 8 people stated in the claim. Additionally, Information 3 provides further context, stating that COVID-19 has had the greatest impact on people aged 65 or over. Therefore, the claim that only 8 people under the age of 65 have died of COVID-19 in Ireland is incorrect.\n\nThe claim is also misleading as it omits crucial details about the number of deaths in the under 65 age group. Information 2 states that the tweet in question makes a critical judgement that only those without an underlying medical condition die 'from' Covid-19, which is not accurate. The use of the word 'from' in the tweet may have led to readers forming an incorrect conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that only 8 people under the age of 65 have died of COVID-19 in Ireland is false and misleading. The claim omits crucial details about the number of deaths in this age group and incorrectly implies that only those without an underlying medical condition die 'from' Covid-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

It implies that the image (showing military trucks winding down a street) was taken in Italy. However, this picture was actually taken in Paris and the trucks are not related to the new coronavirus.\nIt quotes local journalist Beppe Severgnini as saying military trucks had taken away 70 coffins the night before to have the bodies cremated elsewhere in Italy because the cemeteries and crematoriums of Bergamo can’t cope. This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false because the picture does not show trucks carrying the bodies of Covid-19 victims and was not taken in Italy, although the events described in the text have taken place in Italy.\nHowever, Italy has had to use military trucks to move bodies during the crisis.

But even as Italians stayed inside, officials in the country’s north, the front line of the outbreak, pleaded for still stronger measures that would essentially shut down all commercial activity and public transportation in an effort to suffocate the contagion.\nSome older Italians said the streets had a wartime feel.

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19.

As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.

If you have successfully recovered from COVID-19, your blood plasma may contain antibodies to the coronavirus that can be used to help another person fight off the virus.\nIf a clot blocks blood flow in a vein or artery, the tissue normally nourished by that blood vessel can be deprived of oxygen, and cells in that area can die. Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop abnormal blood clotting. “In some people with COVID-19, we’re seeing a massive inflammatory response, the cytokine storm that raises clotting factors in the blood,” says Galiatsatos, who treats patients with COVID-19. “We are seeing more blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), legs (deep vein thrombosis) and elsewhere,” he says.

However, differences in underlying health conditions among Black and Asian people, obtained from primary care records, were able to explain only a quarter of the excess deaths from COVID-19.[2]\nCOVID-19 patients who are admitted to critical care or who die in hospital include a disproportionately large number of people from ethnic minorities.[1][2] In the UK, one in three patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 has been from an ethnic minority group, although they make up only one in eight of the UK population.[3] The excess risk of severe COVID-19 to people from ethnic minorities is visible not only in hospital admissions, but also in the community. In a national cohort of 6 million veterans in the USA, Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested and to test positive for COVID-19 than Whites.[4] In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysed all deaths in England and Wales with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nPeople in ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with higher exposure to coronavirus infection, which could result in more cases of COVID-19.[1] On the other hand, ethnic minority populations tend to be younger on average than the UK population, and younger people are less susceptible to severe illness following infection. The total numbers of deaths recorded in hospitals are similar per capita for Black African and White ethnic groups.\nThe difference was particularly large for Black men and women, who were more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 than White men and women.[5] Can these differences be explained in terms of exposure to coronavirus infection, or susceptibility to severe illness and death following infection, or both?\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds are more likely to die ...\nContent:\nAfter adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian backgrounds were 1.49 times more likely to die compared to those from white backgrounds, and patients from black backgrounds were 1.30 times more likely to die.

However, a Google reverse image search found that the image was published in a report by Indian news website Sakshi TV on June 19, 2019, showing a mother who murdered three children by drowning and later committed suicide. The image was shared on Thai and Hindi Facebook with similar claims.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-08, also debunks the claim that the image shows a family who committed suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. The investigation found that the image has no connection with the current lockdown in India nor the COVID-19 pandemic. The incident occurred in June 2019 due to a woman's husband's excessive alcoholism.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-02-17, states that the image has circulated online since May of 2018, long before the COVID-19 pandemic.

And it can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room. While 4 percent of the country’s cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for about 31 percent of the country’s pandemic fatalities.\n*In New York, the case count is often the same as the death count because the state only reports the number of people who have died but not the number of overall infections.·States with insufficient data to calculate a share of Covid-19 deaths are shaded gray. The share of deaths linked to long-term care facilities for older adults is even starker at the state level. In 5 states, the number of residents and workers who have died accounts for either half or more than half of all deaths from the virus.

AARP continues to urge elected officials to take action to combat this national tragedy, make sure it does not happen again, and ensure that public funds provided to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are used for testing, PPE, staffing, virtual visits, and for the health and safety of residents.\nWhile high primary vaccination rates for residents and staff have given us hope, and have saved many lives, there remain many nursing home residents who are not vaccinated at all, and more than half are not up to date on COVID-19 boosters. Residents and staff who are not up to date are more susceptible to adverse outcomes from COVID-19 exposure, and staff who are not up to date could place residents at unnecessary risk.\nAll nursing home data are from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File (downloaded most recently on 9/1/2023).

Based on long-term care usage and demographics in the states, including Missouri, we also estimate nationally that the share of fatalities from nursing home and residential care facilities is 38 percent, and 41 percent outside of New York State.\nThese figures are lower than our analysis released in late July, when nursing or residential care home resident peaked at 45% of all COVID-19 deaths. As states have prioritized protecting such residents, mortality rates within facilities have decreased relative to the rest of the population. Our calculations are available in an online spreadsheet for public review. We estimate the national share of nursing and residential care home COVID-19 fatalities in three ways:\nThe U.S. is not an outlier in terms of its nursing home-related COVID-19 fatalities. A study by researchers at the International Long Term Care Policy Network of fatalities in a range of high-income countries found that 46 percent of reported COVID-19 fatalities took place in nursing homes.\nThe policy implications of these figures are significant, and suggest substantial flaws in the way that we have managed the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most radical opposition figures, such as Mr Besigye, say that Mr Museveni has such a tight grip that an election alone will never unseat him. Instead, they see the polls as the catalyst for a political crisis, or even a popular uprising. The deployment of armed militia to enforce the covid-19 curfew looks to some like a dress rehearsal for suppressing post-election protests.\nThat is as much as the average Ugandan makes in a year. Some opposition leaders want Mr Museveni to declare a state of emergency and postpone elections. The old soldier is disinclined to do so. His regime has built a civilian architecture over the hard foundations of military power.

The most famous example of pandemics in the pre-modern period was the plague, which repeatedly struck most of Europe and the Near East in successive waves across the centuries.\nIslamic ethical discussions on the themes of plagues and pandemics grew out of commentaries on specific references in the foundational sources: the Qurʾān and Prophetic reports. These references center around a number of moral questions such as: justification for these incidents; relationship between these events and divine destiny as well as the proper view and attitude of a believer towards these events; scope of human intervention and the extent to which such intervention is obligatory; impact of these incidents on ritual deeds; and finally impact of these incidents on social interpersonal interactions.\nHistorical accounts of the various epidemics and plague pandemics that struck different regions at different times show how Islamic normative discussions on topics such as contagion, illness, and medical treatment shaped the attitudes of Muslims during these times. One of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\nOne of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.

This article examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the global pandemic during its early months and provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives.\nDuring data collection, the authors identified six newly established pro-Islamic State groups and channels with coronavirus or pandemic names and themes, in both English and Arabic. Examples include the now defunct Telegram channels “The Pandemic,” “korounna,” and “COVID-19,” among others. Naming groups could be undertaken for various reasons to include: supporters exploiting a timely subject, supporters creating groups and channels dedicated to coronavirus news and discussion, or supporters evading pro-Islamic State group and channel shutdowns through the use of non-Islamic State-themed names.25 When considering the content within these groups and channels, the most plausible reasons are utilizing the newsworthy and global nature of the virus, along with a desire to discuss COVID-19 in environments of shared belief.\nIn turn, 11 dominant themes and narratives were identified, highlighting the ways in which decentralized online pro-Islamic State networks create content designed to appeal to a diverse audience, capitalize on a current event, as well as provide a space for community engagement and camaraderie in a time of social isolation. Although the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic brought much of the world to a stand-still, the internet has allowed people to remain virtually connected and updated on the latest COVID-19-related news, including violent extremist groups and terrorist organizations.\nIt is important to note that the framing of this category is not meant to infer that religion does not have bearing on other themes and narratives in the dataset, including the divine punishment and vindictive categories. Islamic State Coronavirus News: content that denotes the sharing of Islamic State news on the coronavirus. Socioeconomic Decay: content includes discussions on what life will look like after the pandemic: social unrest, economic devastation, and the collapse of society.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-14, discusses a specific instance of misinformation spreading on social media related to the coronavirus pandemic.

The MP claimed that 96.3% of people who died from COVID-19 in Italy had other pre-existing diseases.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false. These claims have been consistently debunked by multiple sources and there is no evidence to support them.", "response": "FALSE."}

The recently developed COVID-19 Social Care Guidance tool7 provides tips on screening for social issues and practical resources to help patients.\nWe suggest continuing to use the ABCDESSS (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure control, cholesterol, drugs, exercise and eating, self-management, screening, and stop smoking) framework to guide visits and have added 2 additional S’s—safety and shots (details on safety are presented on page 3 of the tool). We summarize the common aspects of diabetes care that should remain the same, those that should be changed, and those that can be deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a virtual-first approach to diabetes care during COVID-19, virtual assessments (by telephone or video) should be done every 3 to 6 months and can address most aspects of care.

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.

However, in the following years, cases of type B began to rise. A team of specialists from different medical science centres was established, led by a woman biochemist, Concepción Campa, to work intensively on finding a vaccine.\nBy 1984, meningitis B had become the most serious health problem in Cuba. After six years of intense work, Campa’s team produced the world’s first successful meningitis B vaccine in 1988.

People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection. The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes. The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.\nYou're much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you're in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you.

Asia PacificcategoryStrong quake in Philippines triggers tsunami warnings and evacuationsDecember 2, 2023\n(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday ruled as unconstitutional some of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's orders to control the coronavirus outbreak, including limits on crowd sizes, requirements that people stay home, and the closing of non-essential businesses. Ruling on a lawsuit brought by business owners and Republican politicians, U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV, a Trump appointee, said the restrictions were executed with good intentions but were arbitrary and violated individual rights.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: In COVID-19 Restrictions Ruling, Judge Holds Pennsylvania Governor ...\nContent:\nA federal district court judge ruled last week that several of Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has set out several “tiers of scrutiny” that govern how deferential courts should be when reviewing government actions. Even in emergencies—or, to our minds, especially in emergencies—the Constitution still applies, and government officials must follow it. ... A federal district court judge ruled last week that several of Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional—and for good reason.\nReviewing the record, which included voluminous testimony from Pennsylvania officials, Stickman found that the governor and his aides view their COVID-19 restrictions as the “new normal.” To simply give them unfettered discretion forever, therefore, “risks subordinating the guarantees of the Constitution, guarantees which are the patrimony of every citizen, to the immediate need for an expedient solution.” · That risk is ever higher, Stickman explained, where—as in Pennsylvania—the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented by executive fiat outside the normal legislative or administrative processes.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-29\nTitle: Federal Court in Pennsylvania Finds Governor’s COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nAs the pandemic continues, courts may be less tolerant of restrictions on civil liberties if they are no longer seen as “temporary.” Moreover, as our scientific understanding of the novel coronavirus evolves, wholesale business closures and shutdowns of society may no longer be viewed as the least restrictive means to stop the spread of COVID-19. The ongoing nature of the pandemic also raises questions regarding separation of powers and the legal authority of governors to impose restrictions without legislative approval. Courts may no longer give deference to executive actions that stray into legislative territory. For example, in May, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the state’s “safer-at-home” order and ruled that Secretary of Health Services, acting under the Governors direction, could not continue to extend stay-at-home orders indefinitely without seeking approval from the state legislature required under Wisconsin law.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, states and local governments issued sweeping orders to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. While these orders have been credited with saving lives,[1] they have also had a profound impact on the economy. Numerous legal challenges have been filed with respect to these restrictions in both federal and state courts.[2] Many of these cases raise questions regarding constitutional limits on governmental authority to restrict social and economic activity to protect the public’s health.\nExecutive actions to address the predicted fall surge in coronavirus cases should state their strategic purpose and goals, elucidate the necessity for the restrictions, and set forth criteria to determine if the actions are working and when they will be lifted. Moreover, governors may need to work with their legislatures or follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures to continue to impose restrictions. The need to protect public health from the threat of COVID-19 will continue; however, the nature and source of the protections may need to evolve to survive judicial scrutiny.\nDistrict Judge William Stickman IV of the Western District of Pennsylvania ruled that certain restrictions imposed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf and his administration were unconstitutional. Specifically, Judge Stickman declared that the congregate gathering limitations imposed by Governor Wolf in an Executive Order violated the First Amendment’s right to free assembly.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Federal Judge Rules PA COVID Shutdown Orders Unconstitutional – ...\nContent:\nOn Monday, September 14, 2020, a federal judge in the Western District of Pennsylvania held that significant portions of Governor Wolf’s COVID-19 related shutdown orders were unconstitutional. Importantly, the Court’s ruling struck down orders directed at both “First Amendment” activity, and at restricting the business activities of “non-life-sustaining” businesses. The Court recognized that Governor Wolf’s actions were “undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency.” Nevertheless, the Court ruled, “even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered.\nThe Court recognized that Governor Wolf’s actions were “undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency.” Nevertheless, the Court ruled, “even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered.

The Court concluded that these limits violated the First Amendment rights to assembly and free speech, specifically in that the order unconstitutionally limited their right to hold campaign gatherings and fundraisers.\nThe Court concluded that these limits violated the First Amendment rights to assembly and free speech, specifically in that the order unconstitutionally limited their right to hold campaign gatherings and fundraisers.  · Stay-at-Home Order: Governor Wolf ordered nearly the entire Pennsylvania population to remain home during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, permitting residents to leave their homes for narrow and specific purposes. The Court concluded that these orders violated the 14th Amendment by restricting the right to intrastate travel, right to privacy (i.e., “the right be let alone while otherwise acting a lawful manner”), and the “fundamental right to simply be out and about in public.” The Court held that “[b]road population-wide lockdowns are such a dramatic inversion of the concept of liberty in a free society as to be nearly presumptively unconstitutional.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* The COVID-19 virus is mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets that carry the virus. It can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.\n* COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations have been decreasing in the United States since July 2020.\n* On September 15, 2020, a U.S. federal judge ruled that some of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional. These restrictions included limits on crowd sizes, requirements that people stay home, and the closing of non-essential businesses.\n* The judge, William Stickman IV, stated that the restrictions were arbitrary and violated individual rights, but he acknowledged that they were implemented with good intentions.\n* The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit brought by business owners and Republican politicians.\n* The ruling is significant because the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented by executive fiat outside the normal legislative or administrative processes.\n* The ruling may have implications for future COVID-19 restrictions and the balance between public health and individual rights.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"PA’s COVID-19 Restrictions Ruled Unconstitutional\" is true. A U.S. federal judge did rule that some of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]]. The nucleic acid vaccine is considered as safer alternative than that of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines which are used currently to acquire immunity against dengue, malaria, typhoid and anthrax etc [25,71].

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers were able to come up with vaccines for this new virus much faster because of work that was already happening. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews and evaluates COVID-19 vaccines for quality, safety, and effectiveness. The FDA then issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain vaccines that meet rigorous, science-based standards. The FDA determines that these vaccines are safe and effective for public use.\nDecember 18, 2020 FDA issued the second EUA for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 18 years and older for the prevention of COVID-19. The federal government has been working since the pandemic started to develop, manufacture, and distribute safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\nSeptember 11, 2023 FDA approved and authorized the emergency use of the updated Moderna and -BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines formulated to better protect against currently circulating variants · April 18, 2023 FDA amended the emergency use authorization to simplify the vaccination schedule for bivalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines\nContent:\nWhen monovalent XBB vaccines are not available, any available WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified vaccine, bivalent variant-containing or monovalent index virus vaccines, may be used since they continue to provide benefits against severe disease in high-risk groups.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

Linked to this were constraints on people’s ability to work, seek support from loved ones and engage in their communities. Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression. Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking.\nLoneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression. Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking. ... The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false.

They found that the format does not match Nostradamus' typical quatrain predictions and could not find the words in collections of his prophecies.\n\nInformation 2 (Publication date: 2020-04-09): Reuters discussed a false claim about Nostradamus predicting the coronavirus outbreak. They searched for keywords in \"Les Prophéties\" online and found no results.

They found that the claim shared on social media is not based on any passages in Nostradamus' collective works.\n\nInformation 4 (Publication date: None): PolitiFact published an article stating that there is no evidence Nostradamus predicted the novel coronavirus. They searched for the claimed passage and could not find any similarities in Nostradamus' works.\n\nInformation 5 (Publication date: None): KQED discussed whether Nostradamus predicted coronavirus after all. They mentioned that social media is full of fake Nostradamus coronavirus predictions but could not find any real ones.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that Nostradamus predicted the coronavirus in a 1551 passage about a plague spreading from the east is false. There is no evidence supporting this claim, and multiple sources have debunked it. Nostradamus' prophecies are written in a specific quatrain style, which the claimed passage does not follow.

Although the symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by different viruses.\nBoth the flu and COVID-19 spread in similar ways. Droplets or smaller virus particles from a sick person can transmit the virus to other people nearby. The smallest particles may linger in the air, and another person can inhale them and become infected.\nFlu: A vaccine is available and effective in preventing some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity or duration of the flu. The flu vaccine is reformulated every year in anticipation of the influenza strains that are expected to circulate. It is very important to get vaccinated for the flu as the COVID pandemic continues.\nLisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, explains how the flu and COVID-19 are similar and how they are different.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: PolitiFact | No, WHO has not said COVID-19 no worse than the flu\nContent:\nCorrectiv, which is based in Germany and is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, found in October 2020 that the WHO did not confirm that COVID-19 is less bad than the flu.

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective. Figures from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland show that people admitted with covid-19 after 1 September were about 10 per cent less likely to die than those admitted before then. 16% Estimated coronavirus infection fatality rate for people over 90\nThe best way to work out how many people have been infected is to test the blood of thousands of people to see how many have antibodies to the coronavirus, and then extrapolate the results to entire countries.

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %). Countries with high values in spring 2020 recorded high excess mortality rates again in November 2020: Belgium (58.8 %), Italy (51.6 %), Austria (47.3 %), Malta (40.2 %), France (31.3 %) and Spain (24.4 %).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A ...\nContent:\nFrance’s deaths began around mid-March but the rate was slower than for Italy and Spain.

In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown. In Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.\nIn Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.

Among the debunked myths is the claim that hot air from a sauna or hair dryer will kill COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, but it also debunks the myth that hot air from a hair dryer will kill COVID-19. It explains that drying out the nose too much could be harmful to overall health.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not specified, provides additional context about the misunderstanding of how respiratory illnesses advance and clarifies that hot water doesn't begin to kill bacteria until it reaches at least 140 degrees.\n\nClaim: Using hot air from a hair dryer on sinuses can prevent and treat COVID-19\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is false. Multiple sources, including experts in coronaviruses and cell biology, have confirmed that there is no evidence supporting the claim that using hot air from a hair dryer on sinuses can prevent or treat COVID-19. In fact, doing so could potentially increase the risk of infection by causing tiny tears in the sinuses. It is essential to follow scientifically proven methods to protect oneself against COVID-19, such as washing hands frequently, using soap and water or sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, and avoiding contact with infected individuals.", "response": "FALSE."}

Several widely shared letters by small groups of scientists from different countries pushed strongly in the direction of a natural origin, calling suggestions that COVID-19 emerged in a lab a conspiracy theory.\nChinese officials have consistently rejected not only the hypothesis that the virus originated at the Wuhan laboratory, but that it originated in China at all. Additionally, Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn’t leak from her laboratory. (In April 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health pulled funding for a research project on coronaviruses in which the Wuhan institute was a chief partner.)

President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future.

There you have it, Dr. Hanan Balkhy explaining antibiotics and COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Antibiotics in treatment of COVID-19 complications: a review of ...\nContent:\nThe present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines.\nThe only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example.\nBut posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past.\nOther posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates. In reality, no mRNA versions of an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in any country, according to our research, although some non-mRNA designs have been rolled out in places such as China.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories: The need for ...\nContent:\nWe also identified other misinformation related to children and soldiers dying after receiving the vaccine in multiple countries; it was reported on Facebook that seven children died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Senegal. Lastly, it was falsely reported that Bill Gates had said that 700,000 people would be injured or die from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Tim Nguyen, the head of high impact events preparedness unit at WHO, “You need to have a certain degree of good information out there to reach populations so that they are inoculated and not susceptible to fake news or disinformation…we believe we need to vaccinate 30% of the population with good information in order to have a certain degree of herd immunity against misinformation” [48]. Websites that provide evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines should be developed and disseminated globally as the use of such trusted sources of information have been found effective against misinformation and conspiracy theories [11].\nRumors about the use of vaccination campaigns for political purposes are not new, and such rumors have previously affected vaccination campaigns in some countries, such as Pakistan [38]. During a public health emergency, when there is considerable scientific uncertainty, and political leaders act as frontline crises managers, it often becomes challenging to ensure evidenced-based recommendation over political interest [35]. For example, the statement, “Whether the vaccine comes or not, coronavirus will leave the country” made by a health minister is likely to confuse the public about the necessity of the vaccine [39]. It thus may affect vaccine acceptancy. The claim that vaccine against COVID-19 had already been invented may lead some to come to the conclusion that this pandemic was being used in an attempt to further vaccine sales [40, 41]. Such misinformation may lead to mistrust on pharmaceutical companies, healthcare agencies and emergency responders and impact overall vaccine acce\n43. ABC News.

He told Forbes: “We moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that.” ... False. There is no evidence to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned, and the similarity in the numbers between the newspaper’s publication, the 9/11 feature and the Pfizer vaccine announcement do not give rise to this. The Bill Gates quote on the front of the newspaper has also been taken out of context.\nNow, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.” The paper then refers to the billionaire businessman as “Billy ‘the kid killer’ Gates” (here) . Accompanying the photo of the newspaper is a post from the Facebook user, in which she suggests there is a link between the 9/11 teaser and the Nov. 9, 2020 announcement from pharmaceutical company Pfizer that its vaccine for COVID-19 is more than 90% effective (here) .

This isn't a coincidence and we keep trying to tell you.” · There is, however, no evidence of a link between the newspaper’s publication date, the 9/11 teaser and the date of the Pfizer announcement – and this does not prove that the pandemic was planned.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name of the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 (here).

An alternative way of treatment could be the use of naturally derived molecules with known antiviral properties. We reviewed the antiviral activities of two polyphenols derived from tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea and theaflavins from black tea.\nA few dietary molecules with previously established antiviral activities are also among the candidates evaluated for COVID-19 treatment. In this article, we will review the activity of phytochemicals derived from green tea and black tea. Irrespective of the type of tea, a typical procedure for production of green tea and black tea involves 5 general processes.\nRecent studies have revealed the possible binding sites present on SARS-CoV-2 and studied their interactions with tea polyphenols. EGCG and theaflavins, especially theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) have shown a significant interaction with the receptors under consideration in this review. Some docking studies further emphasize on the activity of these polyphenols against COVID-19.\nEGCG is known to interact with the COVID-19 S protein GRP78 binding site, which is a druggable target, via hydrogen and non-bonded interactions, thus exhibiting its antiviral activity. Apart from these, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been established for these tea polyphenols.

Could US doctors have been primed to see fewer improvements in patients on the drug because of their distaste for Trump’s promotion of it, and the very public backlash it triggered from the medical establishment? None of these explanations seems satisfying, and in any case they would be difficult to test. But the differences point to how uncertainty, when titrated with different combinations of politics and culture, can lead the expert judgment of clinicians in opposing directions.\nBut the differences point to how uncertainty, when titrated with different combinations of politics and culture, can lead the expert judgment of clinicians in opposing directions.

It highlights the importance of using randomized controlled trials as the gold standard for medical evidence.\n\nInformation 2, without a specific publication date, is a statement from Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Bright speaks about clashes with H.H.S. political leadership due to his resistance to funding potentially dangerous drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, which lack scientific merit.\n\nInformation 3, without a specific publication date, discusses various studies on hydroxychloroquine, including those by Oxford University researchers and the British Medical Journal. These studies found no benefit in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The FDA revoked the emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine, and the World Health Organization discontinued its use in the Solidarity trial.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-05-21, discusses a large clinical trial investigating the potential of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to prevent hospitalization or death in COVID-19 patients. Dr. Davey Smith emphasizes the importance of early treatment.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-09-16, explores the impact of politics and culture on the perception of hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness. It suggests that uncertainty, politics, and culture can lead clinicians to form opposing opinions about the drug's benefits.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that hydroxychloroquine is an ineffective COVID-19 treatment (published on 2020-08-06) is consistent with the evidence presented in Information 1, 2, 3, and 5. Multiple studies and expert opinions support the conclusion that hydroxychloroquine does not provide significant benefits for treating COVID-19, especially in hospitalized patients with severe symptoms. Early treatment might still have some benefits, but the overall consensus is that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, the claim is considered TRUE.", "response": "TRUE."}

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ...

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security.

Researchers fed mice infected with the influenza virus a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which resulted in a higher survival rate than compared to those on a normal high-carbohydrate diet. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung and trapped the virus before it became worse.\nDuring the study, the team showed that mice infected with the flu virus that were fed the keto diet had a higher survival rate than mice on a high-carb normal diet. The researchers were more excited to find the details behind this event. The keto diet actually triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not. When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.\nThe two trainees are, Ryan Molony who found that immune system activators called inflammasomes can cause harmful immune system responses in their host, and Emily Goldberg who worked in Dixit's lab, which had shown that the ketogenic diet blocked formation of inflammasomes.

Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nIt is quite evident that one of the reports which had great impact on decision making during the current crisis is the report of Neil Ferguson et al. on the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demands [1]. In their report, using a transmission model founded on an individual-based simulation model for pandemic influenza, the authors investigated the effects of 2 intervention strategies in a UK and a USA context: 1 – Mitigation strategy with the aim of slowing down transmission but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread (reproduction number R not necessarily <1) with protection of more vulnerable groups and reducing the peak healthcare demand, 2 – Suppression strategy in which epidemic spread is reversed to reproduction number (R) <1.\nIn the suppression group social distancing of all age groups, household quarantine and closing schools and universities are further interventions. In the mitigation strategy interventions have to be timely instituted (not too early) to give chance for herd immunity to develop.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Scientists say epidemic suppression is only viable option\nContent:\nIn the UK, this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK (previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated) and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity. “We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\nThe report by Imperial College’s COVID-19 Response Team - Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand – looked at two different strategies.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for ...\nContent:\nIn other words, we simulated a situation that from the second day of receiving confirmed case, only 5% of the overall population would be possible to contact the infectious ones. Then, the β2 = 0.05. The results were shown in the Fig 5. The results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time.\nThe results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time. There would be only more than 40 people that were infection and finally recovered at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. The overall period of COVID outbreak was less than 100 days.\nAmong a variety of factors leading to emergence and outbreaks of ID, the key issues are population density and human mobility where in these cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to at least 146 countries and territories on 6 continents in 2 months.\nAs implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. For COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [11] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results showed that under strong suppression of “lockdown Hubei”, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression ...\nContent:\nFor each scenario, we modeled the first suppression to have been initiated at the median threshold for the setting that has been observed to date (i.e., LICs and LMICs initiate earlier than UMICs and HICs, Table 1). We then selected the ICU incidence trigger within this range that minimizes COVID-19 mortality over 18 months and remains under our ICU threshold. We use a time window of 18 months as representative of the time scale over which pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., a vaccine) may become available, noting that this duration is highly uncertain (25).\nA full understanding of these will only be available retrospectively. Although our results illustrate the challenges that many countries will face in attempting to mitigate the impact of local COVID-19 epidemics, it is important to bear in mind that even moderate levels of changes in behavior can avert many infections and hence save millions of lives (30). Although suppression will always have the greatest impact on COVID-related morbidity and mortality, the intensity of interventions required needs to be balanced against the wider health risks that diverting all attention to a single disease could entail (31, 32).\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, supports the claim that COVID-19 suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.

In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognise the term \"Rohingya\" and prefers to refer to the community as \"Bengali\".\nSince 2015, over 900,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to south-eastern Bangladesh alone, and more to other surrounding countries, and major Muslim nations. More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar are confined in camps for internally displaced persons. Shortly before a Rohingya rebel attack that killed 12 security forces on 25 August 2017, the Myanmar military launched \"clearance operations\" against the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state that, according to NGOs, the Bangladeshi government and international news media, left many dead, and many more injured, tortured or raped, with villages burned.\nThe Rohingya refer to themselves as Ruáingga /ɾuájŋɡa/. In Burmese they are known as rui hang gya (following the MLC Transcription System) (Burmese: ရိုဟင်ဂျာ /ɹòhɪ̀ɴd͡ʑà/) while in Bengali they are called Rohingga (Bengali: রোহিঙ্গা /ɹohiŋɡa/).

The genocide has consisted of two phases to date: the first was a military crackdown that occurred from October 2016 to January 2017, and the second has been occurring since August 2017.\nThe persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar dates back to at least the 1970s. Since then, the Rohingya people have been persecuted on a regular basis by the government and Buddhist nationalists. In late 2016, Myanmar's armed forces and police launched a major crackdown against the people in Rakhine State which is located in the country's northwestern region.\nThe population of the western coastal province of Rakhine State is predominantly Buddhist Rakhine (4% of Myanmar's total population, about 2 million people) while the Rohingya (2% of Myanmar's total population, about 1 million people) are predominantly Muslim.\nTensions between Buddhist and Muslim communities have frequently led to violence in Rakhine State, with nationalist Buddhists often targeting Rohingyas.

When violence resumed in October, it engulfed nine more townships and became a coordinated campaign to forcibly relocate or remove the state’s Muslims.\nThe October attacks were against Rohingya and Kaman Muslim communities and were organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces. Rohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed.\nRohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed. While the state security forces in some instances intervened to prevent violence and protect fleeing Muslims, more frequently they stood aside during attacks or directly supported the assailants, committing killings and other abuses.\nThe violence since June displaced at least 125,000 Rohingya and other Muslims, and a smaller number of Arakanese, to internally displaced person (IDP) camps. Many of the displaced Muslims have been living in overcrowded camps that lack adequate food, shelter, water and sanitation, and medical care.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by Human Rights Watch, details the history of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, a Muslim minority group that has faced systematic abuses and persecution by the Myanmar military and Buddhist nationalists.

There have been increasing calls for research to better capture and report on socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes alongside race/ethnicity to identify populations that may experience a disproportionate burden of risk and/or ability to benefit from pandemic mitigation strategies.(10,13) We observed significant racial/ethnic disparities in ability to social distance as a measure of COVID exposure, susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and access to healthcare in our national cohort.\nMitigation strategies and messaging should intensify focus on Hispanic and Black NH individuals with conditions that increase risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and incorporate targeted, culturally appropriate communication. As with all observational studies, confounding of the exposure-outcome relationship is a concern, and we did not address the possibility of joint effects of the SEP indices.\nWe examined the relationship between each SEP index with COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or seroconversion), and we assessed race/ethnicity as a potential effect measure modifier (EMM) of the relationship between each SEP index and COVID-19 outcome.\nSecond, as the measure of COVID-19 susceptibility, we included conditions or behaviors that CDC has identified as increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications given SARS-CoV-2 infection: aged 60 years or older, daily smoking, and underlying chronic conditions (chronic lung disease, current asthma, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, immunocompromised condition, or HIV positive).

Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

Two tests were positive for COVID-19 infection. Since then, the number of infected persons in Brazil has increased dramatically [14]. Physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 16th [5]. Events expected to attract large numbers of people were cancelled, universities and schools were closed, and only services considered essential to the population remained functional, such as markets, pharmacies and bakeries.\nTo document how the containment measures affected the lives of the Brazilian people, and to understand which containment measures were best adhered to by which strata of the population, we conducted an online survey on the adherence of the Brazilian people to individual public health measures and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives.\nIn another large online survey in Brazil conducted between April 24th and May 24th, assessing only the degree of adherence to physical contact restriction measures, greater adherence was found among females compared to males but it was mainly the 30 to 49 year old group that was less adherent and not the younger age group [23]. People living in rural areas and poor neighborhoods were also less adherent: in rural areas people may not perceive themselves at high risk of COVID-19, and therefore may not respect the national restriction measures and not practice individual hygiene measures [24]. Therefore, extra communication and health education may be needed to change the risk perception in rural areas and popular neighborhoods [25]. Brazilian students reported difficulties to stay home, which may be related to a need to travel to their original homes in periods when schools and universities were closed [26] or could be related to differing social habits among this population.\nThis is a concern, as older age and the presence of (an) underlying health condition(s) are associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality [30, 31] On the other hand, Brazilian respondents with underlying diseases adhered better to the containment measures.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil's COVID-19 guidelines: political hijack of public health ...\nContent:\nBahia School of Medicine and Public Health, Salvador 40290-000, BrazilSearch for articles by this author ...

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency.\nIn the wake of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the practice of ophthalmology has undergone a dramatic and unprecedented shift. The inherent risk of transmission is high due to the need for patient proximity during an ophthalmic exam or surgery, which has led to at least one outbreak in Norway [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. In March 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued practice guidelines and released a list of emergent ophthalmic surgical procedures to be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15]. Subsequently, the rescheduling of routine ocular examinations and limiting procedures to those deemed urgent or emergent has been the basis of many recent publications [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Each has offered specialty specific guidelines to limit transmission moving forward, while allowing for the gradual increase in ophthalmic exams, intraocular injections, and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nAdherence to these recommendations has resulted in an estimated 75% or more reduction of in-person clinic volumes [28]. Concurrently, the implementation of telemedicine visits resulted in an alternative way to provide continued care [3, 25, 29,30,31]. However, the exact reduction of in-patient visits, increase in telemedicine encounters, and the change in the types of diagnoses seen within in an ophthalmology clinic before and after COVID-19 remains unknown. Herein, we describe these changes in clinic volume over all subspecialists in an academic eye clinic as epiphenomena of COVID-19 in ophthalmic practice.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Ophthalmic practice during COVID-19 pandemic - PMC\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (<strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong>) pandemic has caused significant <strong>changes</strong> in ophthalmic <strong>practice</strong>.

Subsequently, the Constitutional Court of Spain ruled that both COVID states of alarm had been unconstitutional.\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose. Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur.

The video mentioned in the claim is likely the same video referred to in Information 1 and 4, which shows a deer and 12 dogs falling into a ravine, not a deer in the sea.

Instead, they explain the process of using a self-test, including collecting a specimen and performing the test. Information 3 debunks the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely referring to the use of a self-test for COVID-19, not specifically testing lung function. However, the claim is still misleading, as it implies that the self-test specifically checks lung function, which is not the case.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially true but mostly misleading.

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24].

The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.\nDeaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories. \"It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people.\"\nThey include claims that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has tested vaccines on children in Africa and India, leading to thousands of deaths and irreversible injuries.

Gates also frequently criticized the U.S. response to the pandemic under former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Fauci sometimes received criticism from Trump while serving as the former president's advisor, including after contradicting false claims Trump made about the severity of the pandemic. Various conspiracy theories targeting Gates, Fauci and others have frequently circulated online, especially on social media, where some platforms took steps to remove posts that spread misinformation.\nIn October, Gates told CNBC that he was concerned that baseless conspiracy theories about himself and Fauci could be harmful to the U.S. coronavirus response if they chipped away at people's trust in public health strategies, such as the rollout of Covid vaccines.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-21, is an article from Fatabyyano stating that the claim about the coronavirus being a hoax to pass Bill Gates' vaccine is false.

We have to be ready. We have to respond. Many well-meaning Ghanaians and friends of Ghana worry that John Mahama’s attitude and words set Ghana back and so it’s critical that the NPP is ready. Former President John Mahama and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) is not the alternative.\nWhatever John Mahama is doing now is about John Mahama and his personal gain. We do not believe it’s about the people of Ghana because none of his sayings has a plan for Ghana. His track record in governance in Ghana shows that he is unable to help Ghana progress. Indeed, any would-be political leader of this era who refuses to recognise the true depth of social and economic stress imposed by Covid-19, seriously amplifying existing challenges, shows that he is only bent on taking power for his own purposes and not for Ghana.\nFinally, former President Mahama talks about corruption.

The symptoms and spread of the disease are related to the virus and its effects, not to sarin gas or any gas-related effects.\n\nInformation 2, though the publication date is not specified, is a review on Nature Reviews Microbiology that discusses the emergence, virology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-26, mentions the coronavirus as a serious threat to Iranians injured by chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq War, many of whom suffer from respiratory problems.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2017-05-05, is an article about autopsies on three Syrians who died in an Idlib province attack, which confirmed the use of sarin gas by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-04-02, explains the differences between COVID-19 and SARS, both of which are caused by coronaviruses.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-03-18, states that there is nothing called coronavirus and COVID-19 is caused by sarin gas. This claim is false based on the available information and general knowledge.\n\nFirst, the information provided in Information 1 explicitly contradicts the claim, stating that COVID-19 is not caused by sarin gas. Information 2 further supports this by discussing the emergence, virology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nSecond, the claim is inconsistent with general knowledge about coronaviruses and sarin gas.

Sarin gas is a nerve agent, a type of chemical weapon that can cause death within minutes if inhaled or ingested in high doses.\n\nLastly, Information 3, 4, and 5 further support the distinction between coronaviruses and sarin gas, as they discuss the coronavirus as a separate entity from chemical weapons or gas-related effects.", "response": "FALSE."}

This claim has been debunked by the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins Medicine. Gargling with salt water can soothe a sore throat, which is a symptom of coronavirus, but it does not protect against the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on March 19, 2020, by The New York Times, also supports the claim that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar does not eliminate the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that gargling salty, warm water can soothe a sore throat, but it does not kill the virus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, reports on a study that is investigating the potential benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation for COVID-19 patients. The study is based on previous research that showed chloride ions in salt inhibited DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. However, the study does not claim that salt water gargle can cure or remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body.\n\nInformation 4, published on November 7, 2023, reports on a study that found that gargling with low- or high-saline solutions consisting of 2.13 grams and 6 grams of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water, respectively, can help reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study involved individuals aged 18-65 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection who were randomly allocated to low- or high-saline regimens for 14 days.\n\nInformation 5 does not provide specific information on the publication date or the source, but it reports on a study that found gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19.\n\nClaim Verification:\nBased on the information provided, the claim that gargling with warm water and salt cures the coronavirus is false. Gargling with salt water can soothe a sore throat, which is a symptom of coronavirus, but it does not protect against the virus or cure the infection.\n\nReference(s):\n[Information 1] USA TODAY, \"False claim: Gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar will eliminate the coronavirus\", published on March 17, 2020, < https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/17/coronavirus-fact-check-gargling-warm-water-and-salt-or-vinegar-wont-eliminate-virus/5066355002/>\n\n[Information 2] The New York Times, \"That ‘Miracle Cure’ You Saw on Facebook?

European Society of Pathology: [The following statement was co-signed by ESP President Prof. Holger Moch, ESP Director-General Dr. Raed Al-Dieri, and ESP Secretary Prof. Aurelio Ariza] In response to some of the claims made by the article “No one has died from the coronavirus,” the European Society of Pathology (ESP) offers the following comments:\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2021-03-04\nTitle: Fact Check-Koch’s postulates do not need to be fulfilled to prove ...\nContent:\nHowever, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here). In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals. This makes it impossible to fulfil this postulate, and by extension, the fourth postulate, in diseases specific to humans (here). Postulate Four: “The microorganism can be transferred from the infected and diseased individuals back into a pure culture.” While not an original postulate of Koch’s (here), this is essentially a repeat of step two using a different source.\nAn article that claims that researchers have not proven that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 uses outdated criteria and presents incomplete facts to make its arguments. The article focuses on how researchers have not fulfilled Koch’s postulates - a 19th-century set of criteria to show a microbe causes a disease - as they were originally understood.\nUpdated criteria for determining viruses that cause disease are sometimes still referred to as Koch’s postulates (here) These involve animals being infected with the suspect virus (here and here) and viruses being grown in cells (here), which would not be considered a “pure culture” as Koch would have understood it (here) and would not fulfil the purification criteria mentioned previously even though other microbes are removed (here). VERDICT False. Koch’s postulates, as they were originally understood, do not need to be demonstrated in order to establish that a microbe causes a disease. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and has been shown to do so by modern standards, including criteria modelled on Koch’s postulates, as well as genetic techniques that were not developed until decades after Koch’s death.\nWhile purposeful infection of humans with disease has been done historically, this is rare due to ethical concerns. However, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here). In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Koch's postulates fulfilled for SARS virus - PMC\nContent:\nThese permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. ...

SARS–CoV–infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re–isolated from these animals and they developed SARS–CoV–specific antibodies.

These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS–CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-07-06, is a fact-check by Science Feedback debunking the claim that no one has died from the coronavirus, no antibodies have been found that identify SARS-CoV-2, pathologists have no means of verifying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 has not fulfilled Koch's postulates. The fact-check mentions that monoclonal antibodies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered and used by pathologists to detect the virus in human tissue.

The committee has a slate of recommendations for federal agencies, journal editors, Congress, clinical trial sponsors, academic centers, healthcare systems and more. They include a new Department of Health and Human Services task force to examine equity in research and ensure data collection; FDA requirements for recruitment plans when submitting an investigational new drug application or investigational new device exemption application; standardized requirements for the submission of demographic data to the ClinicalTrials.gov database; representation data requirements for journal publications; coverage guidelines from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that consider representativeness; a congressional requirement for the FDA to enforce accountability and incentive structures; expedited CMS coverage decisions for drugs and devices that were tested in\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Diversity in Our Clinical Trials | Pfizer\nContent:\nThere are barriers that exist to clinical trial participation, including geographic access, language barriers, limited awareness and communication of research options, cost or insurance concerns, and lack of trust in the medical community and drug development process due to discrimination and mistreatment of ethnically diverse groups in clinical research in the past. In fact, Black Americans account for roughly 13% of the U.S. population but make up only 5% of clinical trial participants. Hispanic and Latino participants account for roughly 19% of the population in the U.S. but make up only 1% of clinical trial participants.* Historic mistreatment and human rights violations in research throughout the world have resulted in changes in the law to ensure that clinical trials are conducted ethically and participants come first.\nAt Pfizer, we are committed to creating change for the better by doing our part to make a more inclusive future for clinical research and by building trusted relationships within diverse communities. Ensuring diversity in clinical trials is a matter of equity.\nThe more diverse a group of clinical trial participants is, the more we can learn about the safety and efficacy of a potential medicine or vaccine for people now and in the future. ... Historically, some communities have been underrepresented as participants in clinical research.\nTo gain an understanding on the disparity of minority representation in our own studies, we published a landmark, 10-year retrospective analysis (taking data from 2011–2020) of the ethnic, racial, age, and gender diversity in our clinical trials. This study serves as an important industry benchmark and baseline from which to measure our future progress in advancing health equity.

Ensuring racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials for development of COVID-19 vaccines is particularly important since COVID-19 has taken a heavy disproportionate toll on people of color, and people of color, particularly Black adults, historically have had lower vaccination rates and express more concerns about getting a COVID-19 vaccine compared to their White counterparts.\nOther access challenges, such as prohibitive distance to trial sites for people with limited transportation options, limited flexibility in work and caregiving schedules, and lack of access to technology for monitoring that may be required as part of the trial also may increase barriers to participation among people of color. Beyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color.\nBeyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color. Further, enrollment efforts may not effectively reach people of color if they are not culturally appropriate and do not address differences in language and health literacy.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n1. A study published in February 2021 by a team of scientific experts from various institutions highlights the lack of diversity in vaccine trials over the past decade. The study emphasizes the need for better representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, as enrollment may impact vaccination rates among minorities. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have set up a committee to improve the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in clinical trials.\n2. An article published on August 17, 2020, discusses the lack of diversity in COVID-19 clinical trials. Researchers have found that minority populations are underrepresented in remdesivir clinical trials. Federal laws instructing the inclusion of minorities in government-sponsored research have not been effectively implemented.\n3. A report highlights the lack of representation in clinical trials conducted in the U.S. The committee recommends creating racial and ethnic recruitment plans for clinical trials, standardized requirements for the submission of demographic data, and representation data requirements for journal publications.\n4. Pfizer acknowledges the barriers to clinical trial participation, including geographic access, language barriers, limited awareness, cost or insurance concerns, and lack of trust in the medical community. Pfizer is committed to creating change for the better by building trusted relationships within diverse communities and ensuring diversity in clinical trials.\n5.

That’s wrong and is based on a misreading of one type of monitoring the agency conducts.\nA prominent anti-vaccine activist’s post on Instagram is misinforming users about the COVID-19 death toll by offering a misinterpretation of one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps tabs on the pandemic.\nPaired with his claim was a screenshot of part of a CDC web page focused on COVID-19 surveillance that does look at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. But Kennedy’s post — which accrued nearly 10,000 likes before it was deleted and has been re-posted by others on Instagram and Facebook — is wrong. “[N]owhere on the CDC or NCHS sites does it say that CDC is counting all PIC deaths as COVID-19 deaths,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email statement.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on July 2, 2020, is a fact-check by AAP FactCheck addressing a claim that Covid-19 tests tainted with the virus have been in circulation for many months. The fact-check states that early in the pandemic, a batch of test kits produced by the US CDC was found to be faulty, with components possibly contaminated with the virus. However, this fault was detected during pre-use validation testing, and the kits were not used on patients. No incidents of false results in patients occurred.\n\nInformation 2, published on July 22, 2020, by the Associated Press, discusses a claim on Instagram that Covid-19 tests tainted with the virus have been in circulation for many months. The post, by an account called \"friends of truth,\" features medical imagery of a nasal swab and claims that the US CDC sent states tainted lab test kits in early February that were themselves seeded with the virus. The post has been viewed more than 280,000 times.\n\nInformation 3, published on July 23, 2020, by The Conversation, is an article about a false claim that Covid-19 tests tainted with the virus have been in circulation for many months. The article discusses an Instagram post by an account called \"friends of truth\" that features medical imagery of a nasal swab and claims that the US CDC sent states tainted lab test kits in early February that were themselves seeded with the virus. The post has been viewed more than 280,000 times.\n\nInformation 4, published on the Instagram Blog, discusses measures Instagram is taking to combat misinformation about Covid-19. These measures include connecting users to resources from the World Health Organization and local health ministries, removing Covid-19 accounts from account recommendations, and downranking content in feeds and stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\n\nInformation 5, published on December 16, 2020, by FactCheck.org, addresses a false claim on Instagram that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting all pneumonia and influenza deaths as caused by Covid-19. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of one way the CDC keeps tabs on the pandemic.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that Covid-19 tests tainted with the virus have been in circulation for many months is false. Information 1, published on July 2, 2020, by AAP FactCheck, states that early in the pandemic, a batch of test kits produced by the US CDC was found to be faulty, but this fault was detected during pre-use validation testing, and the kits were not used on patients. No incidents of false results in patients occurred. Information 2, 3, and 5, published on July 22, 23, and December 16, 2020, also address false claims related to Covid-19 tests being tainted with the virus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false, and Covid-19 tests are not tainted with the virus. Instagram has also taken measures to combat misinformation about Covid-19, as discussed in Information 4, including downranking content in feeds and stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.", "response": "FALSE."}

They were negative. She also said that no antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus had been found. The workers were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, or we would have COVID-12, not COVID-19.\nIn 2016, Shi and her colleagues published a paper from this work, finding that many of the bats were co-infected by two or more different coronaviruses at the same time. Because the bats live huddled in ever-shifting colonies, they circulate viruses endlessly, even across species, which allows different viruses to recombine, creating novel coronavirus strains: an evolutionary bacchanal.

But Hassad adds he believes that this lab-leak theory is on the “extreme low end” of possibilities, and it “will quite likely remain only theoretical following any proper scientific investigation,” he says.\nNewly reported information has revived scrutiny of this possible origin for the coronavirus, which experts still call unlikely though worth investigating. ... Months after a World Health Organization investigation deemed it “extremely unlikely” that the novel coronavirus escaped accidentally from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, the idea is back in the news, giving new momentum to a hypothesis that many scientists believe is unlikely, and some have dismissed as a conspiracy theory.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: News: Was the coronavirus made in a Wuhan...

It mentions the work of Shi Zhengli and her team at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who have been studying coronaviruses in bats. The article explains that Shi's lab fully sequenced RaTG13 in 2018 and tested workers' serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, with negative results.\n\nInformation 2 (No date): This is a brief mention of Nature examining arguments that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab in China and the science behind them.\n\nInformation 3 (2023-03-08): This source describes a hearing by the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability regarding COVID origins. It does not provide specific details about the content of the hearing.\n\nInformation 4 (No date): This source explains the more plausible lab-leak hypothesis, in which the Wuhan laboratory isolated the novel coronavirus from an animal and it accidentally escaped. It mentions that this theory is still considered unlikely but worth investigating.\n\nInformation 5 (No date): This source is from The Los Angeles Times and discusses the genetic evidence related to the possibility that the coronavirus was made in a Wuhan lab.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, stating that a laboratory is giving money to people to be infected with the novel coronavirus, is false based on the provided information. The sources discuss the lab-leak theory, which involves the accidental escape of the virus from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but there is no mention of intentionally infecting individuals with the virus. Furthermore, the information provided by Shi Zhengli in Information 1 indicates that her lab tested workers for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, with negative results, suggesting that they were not intentionally infecting individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is incorrect, and no evidence has been found in the provided information to support the idea of a laboratory paying people to be infected with the novel coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020–February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1). To assess more recent national trends, as well as state-specific trends, CDC used HPS data (4) to assess trends in reported anxiety and depression among U.S. adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) during August 19, 2020–June 7, 2021 (1).\nThe increased frequency of reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in this study indicates that mental health services and resources, including telehealth behavioral services, are critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19. National COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19.\nNational COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19. The mental health impact of COVID-19 also might have community-specific effects when morbidity and mortality rates are increasing as a result of COVID-19. Fluctuations in symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic highlight the importance of real-time monitoring of mental health symptoms.\nFifth, the decrease in the frequency of symptoms observed through June 2021 occurred before the recent surge in COVID-19 cases involving the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; that decreasing trend might have slowed or reversed since June. Finally, these data are based on self-report and are subject to recall and social desirability biases.

There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been attributed to a non-existent US health chief.\n\nInformation 2, published on April 30, 2020, reveals that a post shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims that the US health department chief J Anthony said that salons have been responsible for almost 50% of the deaths.

The information revealing the inaccuracy of this claim was published earlier (April 30, 2020) than the claim itself (May 20, 2020). Additionally, multiple sources confirm the non-existence of the US health department chief, J Anthony, who was attributed to the claim.\n\nThe claim's content is inconsistent with the information, as there is no evidence supporting the idea that hair salons are responsible for almost 50 percent of all coronavirus deaths. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misinformation, as hair salons are not a significant factor in the spread of the virus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is classified as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

More than 170 countries are poised to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, the WHO reported last week. The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19.\nMore than 170 countries are poised to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, the WHO reported last week. The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19. The plan is backed by many U.S. allies, including Germany, Japan and the European Commission and appealed to some members of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. However, Trump has criticized the WHO for what he calls its “China-centric” response to the pandemic, so the U.S. won’t partner with the organization.\nWhen countries opt out, that makes it more difficult to meet the goals of lower vaccine costs, better health outcomes and fewer COVID-19 deaths, the newspaper reported. The decision also likely eliminates the chance that the U.S. could secure vaccine doses from a pool of vaccine candidates across the world. In reality, the vaccine development process will require a global supply chain to manufacture and distribute doses to people, including vaccine components such as syringes and vials.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-01\nTitle: US says it won't join global effort to find COVID-19 vaccine | AP News\nContent:\nThe decision to go it alone, first reported by The Washington Post, follows the White House’s decision in early July to pull the United States out of the WHO.

Methods: We conducted a literature search and identified 232 articles; we included 90 after screening. We pulled information from each article using standardized questions for “type of study,” “population,” “specific vaccine,” “reasons for hesitancy,” “hesitancy prevalence,” “attempt at change,” “results of intervention,” and “future interventions.” We created recurrent themes from the data and analyzed these themes via descriptive statistics.\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do give guidance on general approaches to these conversations, keeping up with hard data and multiple studies on various vaccinations can be tedious and is not realistic for many doctors.8,9 · The theme of not enough information is highlighted by more research being cited as the most commonly proposed future intervention.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions. The study found that the most commonly proposed future intervention was more research, indicating a desire for more information about vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\nInformation 2: This WebMD article, published in 2009, provides information on children's vaccines, including when they should be given and possible side effects.\n\nInformation 3: This article, published by Hopkins Medicine, provides a guide for talking with vaccine-hesitant parents.

These articles were published between April 2020 and October 2020. They address various myths, such as the virus being made in a lab, eating garlic preventing infection, and the virus being a mutated form of the common cold. The articles also mention the role of social media in spreading misinformation and the importance of seeking information from credible sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is a title of an article published on January 19, 2021, that explores coronavirus myths.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is likely to be TRUE.

Nevertheless, the information in the earlier articles highlights the prevalence of misinformation about the coronavirus and the importance of addressing these myths. Therefore, it is plausible that the 2021 article continues to explore and debunk new myths about the coronavirus.", "response": "TRUE."}

In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks, steam sterilization (e.g. in laminate sterilization wrappings) of used masks at 121 ⁰C in laminated bags, is a simple, useful, cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks safe for reuse.\nIn preparation for that scarcity we performed a study to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks in order to verify their re-usability with a method that could be applied in practice using already available equipment. Therefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags.\nTherefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 ⁰C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes are sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus based on the knowledge of inactivation of such viruses. [1,2] A blind comparison of unused sterilized masks was performed with respect to visual inspection, consistency, face fit and breathing resistance.\nBefore sterilization, the batches were individually packed in laminate bags and sterilized with steam sterilization by means of 121 ⁰C in Getinge autoclaves and in combination with permeable laminate bags, Halyard type CLFP150X300WI-S20. The autoclaves were activated on a 121 ⁰C program and validated accordingly. After sterilization, the samples were tested at Delft University of Technology and at Reinier de Graaf Hospital, and benchmarked with new mouth masks.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Disposable masks: Disinfection and sterilization for reuse, and ...\nContent:\nThis paper is based on two objectives: to consult the scientific literature to identify the main strategies for disinfecting them, and to determine the effectiveness of non-certified disposable masks. A rapid review has been conducted in which the main publications and other information available online have been analyzed. Results showed that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam are not fully recommended.\nSoapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam are not fully recommended.

As for other types of masks the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified masks is very low. Keywords: PPE, SARS-COV-2, Coronavirus, Filtering facepiece respirators, Decontamination, Reuse\nConsequently, prevention professionals, companies and individuals, from all over the world need to know how to disinfect and sterilize masks that, in principle, were designed, manufactured and certified for short-term use and subsequent disposal, and also to be aware of the effectiveness of homemade or non-certified ones.\nThus, in this publication we conducted a rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides and other information available online with two objectives. On the one hand, to identify in the scientific literature the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks. On the other hand, to identify the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can disposable masks be reused after sterilization?\nContent:\nIf there are not enough N95 or surgical masks, as long as the mask is not obviously contaminated, soiled or damaged, it can also be considered to be reused in a short period of time. After use you can fold the inner layer of the mask in half, hang it separately or place it in a separate packaging bag. Healthy people can use N95 mask for 8 hours continuously or intermittently, and surgical mask for 4 hours at a time. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases are not recommended to wear them for a long time. ... - Discussion on the feasibility of sterilization and reuse of disposable dust mask by Yu Taishan, He Yufang, et al.\nThe disinfection method of spraying alcohol on the mask will destroy the electrostatic absorption of the mask, causing filtering efficiency of the mask lowering below 95%. 3. Other methods such as steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high temperature sterilization methods also made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%.In addition, high temperature and high-pressure method makes the mask seriously deformed.\nOther methods such as steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high temperature sterilization methods also made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%.In addition, high temperature and high-pressure method makes the mask seriously deformed. 4. The new coronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, and ultraviolet disinfection does not affect the filtration efficiency of respirators.\nThe premise of using the mask again after disinfection is that the sterilized mask can neither affect the free circulation of air nor destroy the filtering mechanism of the mask. So, what kind of disinfection can meet these two points? To find out the influence on the filtration mechanism of masks (N95 mask and medical surgical mask), five disinfection methods were compared: 1) oven dry heat disinfection, 2) alcohol spraying disinfection, 3) steamer wet heat disinfection, 4) high temperature and high-pressure disinfection and 5) ultraviolet disinfection.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for ...\nContent:\nSterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19 as long as the fit does not change and the filter materials are not significantly affected by heat. The varying efficiency after reprocessing amongst different brands shows that only quality masks of particular brands such as 3M Aura 1862, 3M Aura 1873 and My-T-Gear 301 are suitable for limited reuse. The data show that the 121°C sterilization process can be safely implemented as long as proper testing of each batch is possible and the process and logistics is well controlled.\nSterilization with the purpose of reusing medical devices is often driven by cost savings [23]. However, some studies also report the reuse of medical devices to realize environmental benefits [24]. In this study, steam sterilization is used to prevent shortages. In 1986, a survey was conducted including Canadian hospitals reusing disposable medical devices [25]. Forty-one percent of the hospitals confirmed that they reused disposable medical devices, with respiratory therapy equipment as the most reused medical device. Testing by particle counting seems to be essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\nSteam sterilization of used disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages 2020; http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:078a3733-84d6-4d4a-81e6-74210c7fed78 · 23.

Effectiveness of autoclaving in sterilizing reusable medical devices in healthcare facilities.\nSeveral studies have shown the effects of different sterilization methods, including gamma sterilization, plasma sterilization, steam and dry heat sterilization, microwaves, washing machines and UV–C light, as methods to decontaminate face masks for reuse [9–13]. These studies suggest that gamma and steam sterilization conducted at 134°C damage the microstructure of the filter material [9].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Can Disposable Face Masks Be Reused? | Primo Dental Products\nContent:\nAll that considered, it’s only the right time to ask the question: can disposable face masks be reused? And if so, how can you reuse them properly? In this article, we will talk about which face masks can be reused, the proper way to sterilize and reuse your face mask, and what to do with your disposable face masks after you reuse them for the final time.\nAll these instances aside, it may be possible to reuse your disposable mask safely. This brings us to our next topic: Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them.\nCan disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused? Yes, but the way you sterilize them will determine how safe they are to wear the next time you use them. It is not necessary to douse your disposable mask in rubbing alcohol or disinfectant. In fact, treating your face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\nIn healthcare settings, disposable face masks cannot be reused. For general protection against COVID-19, on the other hand, it is possible to sterilize and reuse face masks.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study was conducted to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks for reuse. The masks were sterilized using a 15-minute procedure at 121 ºC with both dry and regular steam processes in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes was sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus. After sterilization, the samples were tested and benchmarked with new mouth masks.\n\nInformation 2: A rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides, and other information available online was conducted to identify the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks and the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization.

Five disinfection methods were compared, including oven dry heat disinfection, alcohol spraying disinfection, steamer wet heat disinfection, high temperature and high-pressure disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection. The steamer damp heat method and high-pressure high-temperature sterilization methods made the filtering efficiency of the mask lower than 95%. High temperature and high-pressure method also cause the mask to become seriously deformed.\n\nInformation 4: Sterilization of disposable face masks by means of standardized steam sterilization at 121°C could be an alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19. Testing by particle counting is essential for both new and sterilized single-use face masks as it indicates the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity.\n\nInformation 5: In some situations, it may be possible to reuse disposable medical face masks safely. However, treating the face mask with any chemical is highly discouraged.\n\nClaim: Disposable masks can be reused if they are sterilized with steam.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. Information 1 and 4 specifically state that disposable face masks can be sterilized with steam at 121 ºC for reuse. This process was found to be effective in inactivating the coronavirus and did not significantly affect the filter materials or fit of the masks. Testing by particle counting is essential to ensure the quality of the mask in terms of filtration capacity. Therefore, if proper testing is conducted, steam sterilization can be a viable alternative during face mask shortages due to COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

Suicide prevention strategies must be tailored to better address disparities in youth suicide risk.\nSchool settings can play an important role in suicide prevention by providing age-appropriate programs that reach a large and diverse number of youth. Although the impact of school closures on youth suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear, racial and ethnic disparities in access to in-person instruction have been documented during the pandemic, and the lack of live instruction has been associated with impaired academic progress, decreased physical activity, lower levels of social and emotional support, and greater emotional distress and exposure to in-home conflict.48 Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of school-based suicide prevention programs to increase mental health literacy, enhance awareness about suicide risk, and to decrease the incidence of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation.49–51 Opportunities exist to continue adapting these programs to broaden their reach with on-line modes of instruction and delivery.\nA recent US Surgeon General’s Advisory provides further research recommendations to effectively respond to the pandemic’s impact on the mental health of the nation’s youth.58 A Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion–informed framework applied to the study and prevention of youth suicide also offers a promising approach to achieving health equity and reducing suicide risk for all youth.59,60 Examining geographic variations in youth suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic is another important opportunity for future research, and a comparative analysis across subgroups may also shed perspective on this study’s findings.\nFindings highlight the need to identify potential mechanisms underlying differential increases in youth suicide deaths associated with the pandemic and to develop broadened and more effective suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide. Additionally, preteen rates of suicide are increasing warranting further research and clinical attention for this understudied subpopulation at risk. Future research is needed to understand the impact of racial and ethnic disparities62 on emotional and mental health of young people, and to monitor longer-term trends of COVID-19-related suicide morbidity and mortality.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Rethinking Youth Suicide Prevention During COVID - WebMD\nContent:\n<strong>COVID</strong>-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases. Here’s a quick guide on how to spot symptoms, risk factors, <strong>prevent</strong> spread of the disease, and find out what to do if you think you have it.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During the COVID-19 Pandemic - National ...\nContent:\nIn a new study supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, researchers examined national youth suicide trends and characteristics in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A research team led by Jeffrey Bridge, Ph.D. , Donna Ruch, Ph.D. , and Lisa Horowitz, Ph.D., MPH, analyzed national suicide data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers first identified all U.S. youth aged 5 to 24 years with suicide listed as the cause of death over the first 10 months of the pandemic (March 1, 2020–December 31, 2020).\nThe significantly higher number of suicide deaths reported for certain racial and ethnic groups, specifically non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black youth, highlights ongoing disparities in rates of suicide that the pandemic may have exacerbated. The increase in suicide deaths among preteens also suggests that more attention may need to be paid to this age group, who tend to be understudied in suicide prevention research and have different developmental needs than older adolescents and young adults.\nThis study shows that the pandemic impacted youth suicide rates, but the impact was not the same for everyone and varied based on sex, age, and race and ethnicity. As such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups.\nAs such, the authors suggest that it may be helpful to broadly implement suicide prevention efforts in settings that serve young people, while also tailoring those efforts to address the disparities faced by specific groups. Moreover, given the extended duration of the pandemic and its ongoing impact on young people in the United States, it will be important to monitor long-term trends in suicide rates associated with COVID-19 and identify factors driving the increased risk for suicide among some people.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Youth Suicide Rates Increased During COVID-19 Pandemic, Especially ...\nContent:\nData suggest depression, anxiety and social isolation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to suicide risk in youth.  · In a study published today in Pediatrics, researchers in the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital found that in the United States, youth suicides increased during COVID-19, with significantly more suicides than expected among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native youth, and non-Hispanic Black youth.\nNational trends in suicides were sourced from the Web-based Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Individuals aged 5-24 years between 2015 and 2020 with suicide listed as the cause of death were included in this analysis. The start of the COVID-19 period was defined as March 2020.  · A total of 5,568 youth living in the United States died by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThis is a group of young people that typically have a very low rate of suicide relative to other young people, and to see an increase in their rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was a cause for concern,” said Donna Ruch, PhD, co-author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Suicide Prevention Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  · The findings of this study highlight the importance of suicide preventive interventions tailored to better address racial and ethnic disparities in youth at highest risk for suicide.\n“To our knowledge, no national study examined changes in youth suicide rates that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeffrey A Bridge, PhD, lead author of the study and director of the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “We wanted to a see if there were any changes in the youth suicide rate that occurred and whether these changes happened with the onset of the pandemic.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Suicide spectrum among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: ...\nContent:\nThird, from a wider perspective, the present work calls for urgent investments in the mental health area aimed at offering the young people easy and free access to the services, both in schools and in other public institutions, to enable the early detection of mental disorders and the prevention of the escalation into suicidality. However, literature about youth suicidality during COVID-19 is still expanding and further research is needed to clarify this complex clinical and public health issue.\nAfter the reopenings, we could have assisted to a sort of rebound, in which long-lasting COVID-19 related worries and a potentially hard adaptation to frequent social interactions after months of limitations could have strongly affected the most vulnerable youth's mental health. These findings have great relevance from both a clinical and a public health point of view. Understanding whether and how adolescents' mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can allow the implementation of tailored policies to prevent and control suicidal phenomena, and to improve the quality of life of this particularly susceptible population.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2021, discusses a study on youth suicide during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that suicide deaths among US youth increased during COVID-19, with substantial variation by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and suicide method.

There is currently “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” according to the World Health Organization.

One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus.\nOne of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check by Reuters discussing a social media claim that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar eliminates the coronavirus. The claim states that the coronavirus remains in the throat for four days before reaching the lungs and that gargling with salt or vinegar can eliminate the virus. Reuters found no official government or medical advisory recommending the use of saline or vinegar to eliminate the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by 15min.lt stating that there is no proof that salt and/or vinegar can kill the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not provided, is a study discussing the effectiveness of various gargle formulations, including salt water, against SARS-CoV-2. The study found that salt water was not proven effective. However, gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SARS-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-11-07, is a study discussing the role of saline regimens on symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2. The study found that both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by FactCheck.org stating that gargling water with salt or vinegar does not eliminate the coronavirus.\n\nClaim: Publication date: 2020-03-16, Content: Gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar kills SARS-CoV-2.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nAccording to Information 1, 2, and 5, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar eliminates or kills SARS-CoV-2. Information 3 also states that salt water was not proven effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, Information 4 discusses a study that found both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study does not support the claim that gargling with salt water kills the virus. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}
