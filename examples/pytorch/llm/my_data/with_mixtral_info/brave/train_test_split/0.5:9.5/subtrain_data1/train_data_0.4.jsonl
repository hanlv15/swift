However, this is untrue. The lab in the picture is not in Wuhan and it does not do any work related to the virus—it is a Shanghai-based company called Shanghai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited that works in the fields of genetic testing and immune systems.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-01-29\nTitle: Is the 'Umbrella Corporation' Logo Oddly Similar to a Wuhan Biotech ...\nContent:\nSocial media posts claimed that the logo of a biotech lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the January 2020 outbreak, was eerily similar to the logo of the Umbrella Corporation. Furthermore, these posts noted how \"corona\" was an anagram for \"racoon,\" the city at the center of \"Resident Evil.\" This eerie coincidence wasn't too eerie on second glance. For starters, the picture on the left did not show the logo for a biotech company in Wuhan.

Even though the Chinese government discredited the possibility of a lab origin based on genetic studies, the distance of the epicenter from the bat caves raises questions. Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4). Naturally, the origins of the epidemic were investigated. All the studies of Shi Zhengli, the lead virologist from the institute, on bat related coronaviruses were centered in the southern, subtropical areas of Yunnan. However, the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, which is almost 900 km from Yunnan. This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nUp to 96% similarity was found between SARS-COV-2 and the bat coronavirus using whole-genome analysis [7]. This theory was supported by other studies that have been summarized in detail elsewhere [8, 9]. A study supported this suggestive finding by using sequence-based analysis and artificial intelligence on the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus [10]. Snakes were found to be the most probable wildlife repository for the virus compared with other animals [11]. Conversely, another study suggested that SARS-COV-2 could have originated from bats but with pangolins as the possible intermediate hosts [12].\nIn conclusion, all these specific features observed in SARS-COV-2 helps scientists to rule out the idea that this pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is the result of a man-made action that could be either engineered in the laboratory or further created as a bioweapon out of conspiracy.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-06-14\nTitle: Nature-based or lab leak? Unraveling the debate over the origins ...\nContent:\nABC News also reported in June 2020 that satellite images showed dramatic spikes in auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the novel coronavirus may have been present before the outbreak was first reported to the world.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-12\nTitle: How we know the COVID-19 coronavirus wasn't made in a lab\nContent:\nSo there's no evidence suggesting that it was manmade or laboratory created somehow. Narrator: So what if they went with the other option and mutated an existing virus? This is known as serial passage and acts in a similar way to selective breeding. Scientists are able to mimic evolution, to a degree. By forcing the virus to mutate over and over again into a potentially different form. This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.\nNarrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has. So creating a new, deadly backbone is pretty much impossible. But there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\nBut there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.

It mentions genetic studies that found up to 96% similarity between SARS-COV-2 and bat coronaviruses, and also suggests that pangolins could be possible intermediate hosts. However, the information concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 14, 2021, reports on satellite images showing increased auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present before the outbreak was reported to the world.\n\nInformation 3, published on June 12, 2020, explains that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 was manmade or laboratory-created. It also explains that creating a new virus with significant devastation is currently impossible, but notes that a virus could be created in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 1, 2020, is a fact-check that debunks the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory.

Information 4 and 5, both published before the claim, debunk this theory and provide evidence for the natural origins of the virus. Information 1 also concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action.

Additionally, Information 3 explains that while it is possible to create a virus in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point, there is no evidence to suggest that this is what happened with SARS-COV-2.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory is not supported by the available evidence.

These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections. We investigated whether a previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical progression of COVID-19 A case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil.\nA case-control study comparing the proportion with a BCG vaccine scar (indicating previous vaccination) in cases and controls presenting with COVID-19 to health units in Brazil. Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nOur analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19. One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ...

We have to be ready. We have to respond. Many well-meaning Ghanaians and friends of Ghana worry that John Mahama’s attitude and words set Ghana back and so it’s critical that the NPP is ready.

These medications can put people at risk for other diseases, including COVID-19. Because of this potential immunosuppression, it's essential for people with psoriasis to obtain COVID-19 vaccination.\nAccording to the National Psoriasis Foundation COVID-19 Task Force, existing evidence suggests that people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis—a type of arthritis linked to psoriasis—have the same likelihood of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infection as the general population.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-04-19\nTitle: COVID-19 and Psoriasis: Is There a Link?\nContent:\nThat being said, we know that many different infections can cause psoriasis flares, and so in that respect, it's not that surprising that SARS-CoV-2, like other infections, could trigger a psoriasis flare.” · Could getting COVID more than once cause psoriasis to flare?

In order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus which gave rise to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019, governments brought in health measures at varying levels of strictness to restrict the movement of people and transmission of the virus.\nBetween August and October 2021, several protests were held across New Zealand to protest official lockdown measures, vaccination, and spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Key groups and individuals that were involved in these protests included FACTS NZ, Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa, the NZ Liberty Movement and Jami-Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika's Advance New Zealand party. In January 2021, Te Kahika led a \"freedom rally\" outside the New Zealand Parliament; protestors opposed lockdown policies, while expressing support for US President Donald Trump and QAnon.\nOn this day, the stay-at-home order had been in place for 90 days, making it the longest mandatory quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 July, the country's Independence Day, protests flared up once again. In addition to workers and entrepreneurs asking to be allowed to work, many were angered by the fact that Lazaro Baez, who is serving jail time for money laundering and stealing from taxpayers' money and is associated with much of the government staff, could be eligible for parole. This incident, and the murder of Fabián Gutiérrez, who was ex-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's secretary while she was in office, which many opposition affiliates believe was orchestrated by the administration and covered up as a \"crime of passion\" by two unknown men, also caused large outrage in some sectors of the population.\nProtests, demonstrations and strikes occurred around the world against national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by governmental bodies.

Our study did not find evidence of increased COVID-19 hospitalization rates after protests occurred in California counties. While the limitations noted underscore the need for caution with interpreting a causal relationship from our findings, the results do support the notion that it is possible to protest safely in the midst of a pandemic, ostensibly, so long as evidence-based precautionary measures are taken [48]. As the pandemic continues into its second year, public demonstrations related to COVID-19 and societal issues remain fixtures of daily life around the world [49]. Further research is needed to understand both the individual-level relationship between protest participation, SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality, particularly with more virulent strains such as the Delta variant resulting in breakthrough cases among vaccin\nThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship between public protests and county-level, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization rates across California. Publicly available data were included in the analysis from 55 of 58 California state counties (29 March–14 October 2020). Mixed-effects negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between daily county-level COVID-19 hospitalizations and two main exposure variables: any vs. no protests and 1 or >1 protest vs. no protests on a given county-day.\nThree spline variables were created to represent the three time periods in our models based on visual observation of average changes in county hospitalization rates over time (see Supplementary Figure S1 for observed vs. predicted COVID-19 hospitalization rates using this time trend). The knots (1 June and 21 July) were also selected since they provided the best model fit to predict COVID-19 hospitalization using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). To explore patterns in the data, graphs were used to describe (1) the daily average COVID-19 hospitalization rate and the total number of protests across the total sample of 55 counties, and (2) the proportion of protests by protest type, overall and for the counties with any protests.\nEthical review and approval were waived for this study since only publicly available data were used. Not applicable. COVID-19 hospitalization data comes from publicly available data from the California Department of Public Health. Protest data was obtained from the publicly available website Count Love.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Emergence of protests during the COVID-19 pandemic: quantitative ...\nContent:\nHumanities and Social Sciences Communications volume 9, Article number: 68 (2022) Cite this article ... The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an upsurge of protests. The emergence of civil resistance movements is often associated with various conditions of social systems. The analysis of social systems also shows the importance of considering the behaviour time scale and in particular slow-fast dynamics. The fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon.\nThe fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon. This paper proposes a holistic approach to explore the relationship between societal conditions and the emergence of protests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the following sections we introduce a holistic analysis approach to the emergence of civil resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we discuss the theoretical basis of our approach and develop a casual loop diagram to capture these findings and conceptually model the emergence of civil resistance at a societal level. Using this conceptual model, several hypotheses on the impact of societal conditions to the emergence of protests are tested.\nWith this computational approach, we can test whether existing theoretical models for the emergence of protests provide a realistic explanation for the emergence of protest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our CLD and statistical analysis, we can model latent processes that yield protests as a function of significant factors identified with our statistical analysis.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nYes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading.

Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe. This comprehensive search led to the identification of 13 regions of the human genome that appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection or severity.\nThe new study, published in the journal Nature, includes data collected through the initiative as of January 2021, and represents nearly 50,000 COVID-19 patients and another 2 million uninfected controls [1].

How does the immune system remember and recognize viral invaders it has encountered in the past? A trio of newly published studies of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated against the virus or both, are providing tantalizing new clues about the factors that influence the speed and magnitude of the immune system’s response to subsequent infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe three studies, published in Science Immunology and led by investigators at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, provide intriguing answers about how long COVID-19 immunity lasts and the nature of immune recall after infection, vaccination, or both.\nThe team analyzed the immune system’s response after infection, vaccination, and boosting by studying blood samples from individuals with different medical trajectories — those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but were not vaccinated, those who recovered from infection and were then vaccinated against COVID-19, or those who were never infected but had been vaccinated and boosted.\nIn addition, the researchers found evidence suggesting that memory of prior infection with common cold coronavirusesmild viruses that circulated before SARS-CoV-2—might be responsible for the robust, sustained immune response in a small subset of unvaccinated individuals who recover from COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity - PubMed\nContent:\nTherefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

Specifically, Information 2, 4, and 5 all confirm that New Zealand had no hospitalized COVID-19 patients and no new cases for at least five days prior to the claim's publication date. Therefore, the claim is likely true based on the available information.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-06-12, and the information provided in the sources supports the claim. Information 2, 4, and 5 all confirm that New Zealand had no hospitalized COVID-19 patients and no new cases for at least five days prior to the claim's publication date. This information was published before the claim, making it a reliable source to verify the claim.\n\nFurthermore, Information 1, which was published after the claim, does not contradict the claim. It only states that a video from Italy was falsely claimed to be from New Zealand. This information does not affect the validity of the claim about the last COVID-19 patient being discharged from the hospital in New Zealand.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely true.\n\nEvidence:\n\nInformation 2, 4, and 5 all support the claim that the last COVID-19 patient was discharged from the hospital in New Zealand, and there were no new cases for at least five days prior to the claim's publication date.\n\nSource:\n\nInformation 2: <https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/victory-new-zealand-discharges-its-last-coronavirus-patient-from-hospital.html>\nInformation 4: <https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-05-28/new-zealand-discharges-last-hospitalized-covid-19-patient>\nInformation 5: <https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/121634885/new-zealand-discharges-its-last-coronavirus-patient-from-hospital-video>\nInformation 1: <https://www.boomlive.in/false-doctors-of-a-hospital-in-new-zealand-are-cheering-in-this-video-its-from-italy/>", "response": "FALSE."}

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19. In this study, we tested four commercially available mouthwash/gargle formulations and salt water against SARS-CoV-2.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Gargling Salt Water Could Lower COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk\nContent:\nRinsing your throat or nose with a salt water (saline) solution may help protect against severe COVID-19 infection, based on a new study presented this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Anaheim, California.

COVID-19: Researchers Launch Study to Lessen ...\nContent:\nSalt water gargle is a time-tested way to alleviate sore-throat pain. As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.

Richard Horton recently called COVID-19 a syndemic.1 He aptly used this concept to describe how COVID-19 clusters with pre-existing conditions, interacts with them, and is driven by larger political, economic, and social factors.2\nCOVID-19 is not a pandemic. It is a syndemic. The syndemic nature of the threat we face means that a more nuanced approach is needed if we are to protect the health of our communities. ... The notion of a syndemic was first conceived by Merrill Singer, an American medical anthropologist, in the 1990s. Writing in The Lancet in 2017, together with Emily Mendenhall and colleagues, Singer argued that a syndemic approach reveals biological and social interactions that are important for prognosis, treatment, and health policy.\nAs the world approaches 1 million deaths from COVID-19, we must confront the fact that we are taking a far too narrow approach to managing this outbreak of a new coronavirus. We have viewed the cause of this crisis as an infectious disease. All of our interventions have focused on cutting lines of viral transmission, thereby controlling the spread of the pathogen.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-10-05\nTitle: FALSE: Social media users say that The Lancet article \"Covid-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: The Lancet has not denied that there is a pandemic.

Such assessments can inform public health policies and contribute to evidence-based choices of NPIs during subsequent waves or future epidemics.

In the uncontrolled first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, R 0 was around 2·4.20 With intensive contact tracing and the isolation of infected individuals, in addition to the implementation of a range of public health and social measures,21 the effective reproduction rate can be reduced to less than 1, and the epidemic will decline.\nSection 2 provides an annotated chronology of the COVID-19 pandemic and thematic findings regarding several issues. Section 3 presents our policy recommendations, particularly around multilateral cooperation centred at WHO to address global health crises, and around investments in preparedness for future health crises through strong national health systems and international financing and technology cooperation with the world's lower-income regions. The Lancet COVID-19 Commission was established in July, 2020, with four main themes: developing recommendations on how to best suppress the epidemic; addressing the humanitarian crises arising from the pandemic; addressing the financial and economic crises resulting from the pandemic; and rebuilding an inclusive, fair, and sustainable world.1 The 28 Commissioners are global experts in public policy, international cooperation, epidemiology and vaccinology, economics and financial systems, sustainability sciences, and mental health.\nIdentifying these origins would provide greater clarity into not only the causes of the current pandemic but also vulnerabilities to future outbreaks and strategies to prevent them. We concur with the position of 18 leading scientists who wrote in Science magazine44 in May, 2021: “We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data.” As a group of 16 scientists communicated in The Lancet 45 in October, 2021: “Overwhelming evidence for either a zoonotic or research-related origin is lacking: the jury is still out.” More than 2 years into the pandemic, the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete and inconclusive.46, 47 Independent experts consulted by the Lancet COVID-19 Commission shared the view that hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers are in play and need further investigation.\nThis Fund should combine and expand the operations of several existing health funds and add new funding for three windows of financing: commodities for disease control, pandemic preparedness and response, and primary health system strengthening in LMICs. We propose that the Global Health Fund should have its headquarters in (Continues on next page)(Key recommendations continued from previous page)Geneva, Switzerland, but have strong regional offices in each of the six WHO regions.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: The Lancet article \"COVID-19 is not a pandemic\" refers to COVID-19 as a syndemic, which clusters with pre-existing conditions and is driven by larger political, economic, and social factors.

The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to support smaller employers.\nAmong the loans made with the first $350 billion of the Paycheck Protection Program, three-quarters of those loans were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people. In addition, singling out Trump for problems with how coronavirus relief efforts ignores that the efforts were also backed by virtually all congressional Democrats.

The CARES Act did include provisions to support smaller businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This information is consistent across multiple sources, including Politifact, Poynter, and WRAL.com.

To try and slow the spread of Coronavirus, a countrywide three-week lockdown order was issued by Prime Minister Modi, which will be in effect until April 14, 2020.\nIn Andhra Pradesh, 60-70% of urban consumers pay their bills online. The state also has hired consultants to assist in the collection of dues maintaining COVID-19 protocol. The state has not just been innovative but also proactive by launching an app and training the urban population to pay their bills online.\nEven with all the relief provided, many DISCOMs, including those in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh, have been refusing to pay the power generators claiming their inability to collect power dues from the consumers. On the other hand, the DISCOMs’ claim of force majeure (Coronavirus outbreak) for not paying generators has been rejected by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). As of February, DISCOMs owed power generators ₹924.25 billion (~$12.19 billion).\nAn official at the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) told Mercom that they have over 11.81 million consumers (as of March 31, 2019) and the revenue for the financial year (FY) 2018-19 was ₹183.61 billion ($2.43 billion). Of this, ₹112.81 billion ($1.49 billion) came through online payment gateways like Electronic Service (ECS), debit or credit card, and net banking. So, about 61% of their bill collections came through online payment modes. In Andhra Pradesh, 60-70% of urban consumers pay their bills online.

Instead, Information 5 mentions that DISCOMs in Uttar Pradesh have been refusing to pay power generators, claiming an inability to collect power dues from consumers due to the force majeure of the Coronavirus outbreak. This information suggests that consumers are still expected to pay their electricity bills, although they might be facing difficulties in doing so due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, and the Uttar Pradesh government did not waive off electricity bills for consumers amid the COVID-19 lockdown.", "response": "FALSE."}

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals. At the same time, the diffusion of unemployment and poverty, combined with the absence of any state support or social security framework for attaining economic prosperity and security, has created a fertile ground for the reliance on quick options for success.\nAs a result of the favourable legislation, 23 companies now hold licences for slot machine clubs, five companies are licensed for casinos and 8 companies are licensed as betting shops.[2] Today, Austrian companies and companies from countries with tax incentives, which are known as offshore financial centers, are the biggest players in the Macedonian market of games of chance.[3] Whilst in most countries the number of casinos is limited and they are located outside the cities, this is not the case for Macedonian casinos.[4] Casinos and betting shops occupy central locations in Skopje as well as other cities across the country.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-14, is an article with the claim that Macedonia has three times more active coronavirus patients than China.

Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: San José del Guaviare Jorge E.

Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the Mediterranean. They often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea.\nPérez-Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper Pueblo and then for Televisión Española (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer.\nThey often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea.

By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.

These are the prices fixed by Serum Institute of India (SII) for the Covishield vaccine:\nBy allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities. “Pricing should be uniform.

Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. Private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose.\n\nInformation 3 is a repetition of Information 1.\n\nInformation 4, published after the claim, discusses the debate around the high prices of the Covishield vaccine and the argument that the vaccine should be free for all. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nInformation 5, published after the claim, states that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, costing Rs. 1,200 ($16.42) per dose. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context. The claim should have specified that the vaccine is free of cost in public healthcare facilities in India, but not necessarily in private healthcare facilities.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. This information is from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making it a reliable source.

As suggested in the apt title of a recent paper by Platje et al. (2020), the COVID‐19 pandemic appears to have been “both an expected and unexpected event.” However, many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration's response were not only foreseeable but were, in fact, foreseen.\nTrump, sobered by worst‐case scenario death projections (McGraw & Oprysko, 2020), accepted Fauci and Birx's public health framing that a shutdown was needed to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed and save lives (White House, 2020h). Trump was then persuaded to extend the shutdown for an additional 30 days. In addition to the shutdown, to cope with the economic fallout of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Trump supported, and, on March 27, 2020, signed into law, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) (AJMC, 2021).\nIn the US alone, the horrifying costs of the pandemic can be measured in the millions of Americans infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the many hundreds of thousands confirmed dead with or from COVID‐19 to date (Johns Hopkins University, 2022). While the pandemic came as a rude awakening to many nonspecialists, the predominant view among health security professionals was that the question was not whether but when the next major pandemic or public health emergency would strike. Yet, despite these insights, decades of preparedness work, and considerable investment, President Trump, in March 2020, claimed, “Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\nWarnings were regularly made in the media (e.g., Yong, 2018), by prominent individuals, such as Bill Gates in a widely viewed 2015 TED talk, and by Trump's own experts, who predicted, based on a 2019 influenza simulation, that the US would be underprepared, underfunded, and would be unable to respond effectively to a pandemic. With over 400,000 deaths in the US as a result of COVID‐19, at the time Trump left office, this assessment appears tragically prescient. Multiple studies have concluded that many of the deaths in the US were avoidable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-19\nTitle: AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s virus revisionism; Biden on the hoax | ...\nContent:\nThe institute now forecasts more than 378,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by Jan. 1. In early April, U.S. officials estimated at least 100,000 would die from the pandemic even if all conceivable steps were taken against it — a thorough and enduring lockdown, full use of masks and more. A death toll up to 240,000 assumed aggressive mitigation. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so — a number that puts the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\nFirst and most notably, the U.S. is not running “substantially” below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Tens of thousands of new infections are being reported each day.

This is factually wrong, disingenuous, immoral and disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working every day to defeat this virus. It completely ignores the real, successful efforts by the Trump administration to save lives.\nBiden, Harris, Democrats and the media may continue to lie about COVID-19. But in the end, the American people will recognize the lives which have been saved and the real efforts which have been made to save them. The virus has tragically killed 214,000 Americans. President Trump—and the brave men and women in our public health system—have saved 2 million.\nIn fact, Biden already has a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics—his previous tenure as vice president is part of the reason federal agencies were strapped for resources at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In May, his own former chief of staff, Ron Klain, told Politico it was \"purely a fortuity\" that the Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 outbreak didn't turn out to be \"one of the great mass casualty events in American history.\" Klain continued, \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck.\" We don't need to ask Biden how he would have dealt with the current pandemic, because we know how badly he handled the last major viral event.\nIn the first two debates of the 2020 presidential contest, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris claimed that President Donald Trump is personally responsible for the more than 214,00 Americans who have perished from COVID-19.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: FALSE: Trump called COVID-19 a \"hoax\"; Trump's pandemic response ...\nContent:\nExplanation: Video w/ Trump calling the virus a \"hoax\" was misleadingly edited; Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die; it rather avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario.

The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed. Remember to check the date when the fact-check you are reading was published before sharing it.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a date, states that President Trump’s decisive action has helped save American lives, with the United States having a lower excess mortality rate than Europe and among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 99.997% of individuals aged 19 and younger who contract coronavirus make a full recovery, 99.98% of those aged 20 to 49 make a full recovery, and 99.5% aged 50 to 69 fully recover.\n\nInformation 2, published without a date, explains that the COVID-19 pandemic was both expected and unexpected, and that many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration’s response were foreseeable and foreseen. Trump was persuaded to extend the shutdown and supported a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill. Despite warnings and preparedness work, Trump claimed in March 2020 that nobody knew there would be a pandemic of this proportion.\n\nInformation 3, published on September 19, 2020, states that the U.S. is not running substantially below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so, putting the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\n\nInformation 4, published on October 13, 2020, claims that President Trump and the brave men and women in the public health system have saved 2 million lives, and that Biden and Harris have a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics.\n\nInformation 5, published on October 30, 2020, states that a video of Trump calling the virus a “hoax” was misleadingly edited, and that Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die. Instead, it avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim that Trump called COVID-19 a hoax is false. The claim that Trump’s pandemic response saved 2 million lives is also false, as the information states that the Trump administration has saved lives, but does not provide a specific number. Furthermore, the claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is not supported by the provided information.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nThe claim that Trump called COVID-19 a hoax is false, as stated in Information 5, published on October 30, 2020. The AFP fact-check found that a video of Trump calling the virus a “hoax” was misleadingly edited.\n\nThe claim that Trump’s pandemic response saved 2 million lives is also false, as the information provided does not support this claim. Information 4, published on October 13, 2020, states that President Trump and the brave men and women in the public health system have saved 2 million lives, but does not provide evidence to support this claim. Information 5, published on October 30, 2020, states that Trump’s pandemic response did not save two million people who were expected to die, but instead avoided an unlikely worst-case scenario.\n\nThe claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is not supported by the provided information.

The claim that the U.S. has a lower mortality rate than Europe during the pandemic and one of the lowest fatality rates is also not supported by the provided information.", "response": "FALSE."}

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive.

However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%.

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather.

As of January 27, 2020, the estimated death toll was 81, all in China. The latest official figures bring the death toll in Wuhan to over 3,800, increasing the national total to over 4,600. However, estimates show Wuhan's death toll is far higher than the official figure, with most people in Hubei province believing that more than 40,000 people died in the city before and during the lockdown. Wuhan saw 28,000 cremations in the space of a single month, suggesting that the online estimates over a two-and-a-half month period weren't excessive. Therefore, the claim is false, and the actual death toll in Wuhan is likely much higher than the official figure.", "response": "FALSE."}

Security forces killed thousands of Rohingya in crimes against humanity and genocidal acts.\nThe Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State face systematic abuses that amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid, persecution, and deprivation of liberty.

In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognise the term \"Rohingya\" and prefers to refer to the community as \"Bengali\".\nSince 2015, over 900,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to south-eastern Bangladesh alone, and more to other surrounding countries, and major Muslim nations. More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar are confined in camps for internally displaced persons. Shortly before a Rohingya rebel attack that killed 12 security forces on 25 August 2017, the Myanmar military launched \"clearance operations\" against the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state that, according to NGOs, the Bangladeshi government and international news media, left many dead, and many more injured, tortured or raped, with villages burned.\nThe Rohingya refer to themselves as Ruáingga /ɾuájŋɡa/. In Burmese they are known as rui hang gya (following the MLC Transcription System) (Burmese: ရိုဟင်ဂျာ /ɹòhɪ̀ɴd͡ʑà/) while in Bengali they are called Rohingga (Bengali: রোহিঙ্গা /ɹohiŋɡa/).

The genocide has consisted of two phases to date: the first was a military crackdown that occurred from October 2016 to January 2017, and the second has been occurring since August 2017.\nThe persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar dates back to at least the 1970s. Since then, the Rohingya people have been persecuted on a regular basis by the government and Buddhist nationalists. In late 2016, Myanmar's armed forces and police launched a major crackdown against the people in Rakhine State which is located in the country's northwestern region.\nThe population of the western coastal province of Rakhine State is predominantly Buddhist Rakhine (4% of Myanmar's total population, about 2 million people) while the Rohingya (2% of Myanmar's total population, about 1 million people) are predominantly Muslim.\nTensions between Buddhist and Muslim communities have frequently led to violence in Rakhine State, with nationalist Buddhists often targeting Rohingyas.

When violence resumed in October, it engulfed nine more townships and became a coordinated campaign to forcibly relocate or remove the state’s Muslims.\nThe October attacks were against Rohingya and Kaman Muslim communities and were organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces. Rohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed.\nRohingya men, women, and children were killed, some were buried in mass graves, and their villages and neighborhoods were razed. While the state security forces in some instances intervened to prevent violence and protect fleeing Muslims, more frequently they stood aside during attacks or directly supported the assailants, committing killings and other abuses.\nThe violence since June displaced at least 125,000 Rohingya and other Muslims, and a smaller number of Arakanese, to internally displaced person (IDP) camps. Many of the displaced Muslims have been living in overcrowded camps that lack adequate food, shelter, water and sanitation, and medical care.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by Human Rights Watch, details the history of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, a Muslim minority group that has faced systematic abuses and persecution by the Myanmar military and Buddhist nationalists. The Rohingya have been denied citizenship and face restrictions on their freedom of movement, access to food, healthcare, education, and livelihoods.

Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations. The study analyzed data from 4,510 participants of the UK Biobank who underwent COVID-19 testing in the hospital.\n* Information 2, published on 2021-02-23, reviews data showing worse risk and outcomes for non-White patients with COVID-19 and proposes policy measures to mitigate the disparities.\n* Information 3, published on 2022-10-06, explains how underlying health problems, living and working conditions, and racism can affect who becomes severely ill with COVID-19.\n* Information 4, with no publication date, discusses racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to COVID-19, susceptibility, and healthcare access. It mentions measurement error concerns and calls for better data collection on socioeconomic determinants.\n* Information 5, published on 2020-08-17, summarizes key findings from data and analyses on COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020. It highlights disparities in cases and deaths for Black and AIAN people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\n\nBased on the available information, the CLAIM that there is increasing concern over COVID-19 race-related disparities is TRUE. The provided information shows that researchers and experts have been expressing concern over racial and ethnicity-related disparities in COVID-19 outcomes since at least June 23, 2020. These concerns are based on data and studies that demonstrate higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in BAME populations and disparities in cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing between racial and ethnic groups.", "response": "TRUE."}

In the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements.\nA key strain of the president’s narrative is that concerns about the coronavirus are being weaponized by bad-faith actors—a notion that has spawned a broad range of conspiracy theories. On Fox Business, Trish Regan accused Trump’s enemies of trying to “create mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off” that would harm his reelection prospects: “This is impeachment all over again,” she declared. Rush Limbaugh has mused that the president is the target of “virus terrorism.” And on Facebook and Twitter, a meme has begun circulating among Trump fans that darkly suggests a new disease is introduced every election year to influence politics.\nIn the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements. But in recent days, as U.S. health officials have raised growing concerns about the outbreak, Trump’s efforts to play down the pandemic have been amplified by the same multi-platform propaganda apparatus he’s relying on for reelection in November.\nScholars who study modern disinformation tactics have identified this approach as “censorship through noise.” (Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist, has described the strategy in blunter terms: “Flood the zone with shit.”) As I reported in my recent feature on the Trump campaign, the purpose of this sort of propaganda blizzard is not to inspire conviction in a certain set of facts; it’s to bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts, and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion. Read: The billion-dollar disinformation campaign to reelect the president · Spend some time wading through the coronavirus content that’s spreading through the MAGA ecosystem, and it’s easy to see the strategy at work. Trump supporters have been warned incessantly not to trust mainstream journalistic coverage of the issue.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-02, is an article from Snopes investigating whether President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a 'hoax'. The article explains that during a campaign rally in South Carolina on Feb 28, 2020, President Trump accused Democrats of politicizing the coronavirus outbreak and called it \"their new hoax\", but did not specifically call the virus itself a hoax.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, is a press release from the Trump Campaign, which includes quotes from Snopes, Lead Stories, and The Washington Post, all stating that President Trump did not call the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy\" is mostly false. While President Trump did use the term \"hoax\" in relation to the coronavirus, it was in the context of the Democrats' politicization of the virus, not the virus itself. This is supported by Information 1, which was published shortly after the event in question and provides a detailed analysis of President Trump's comments.\n\nInformation 3, a press release from the Trump Campaign, also supports this conclusion by quoting several reputable fact-checking organizations that have debunked the claim that President Trump called the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nTherefore, the claim that President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy is mostly false, as he specifically referred to the Democrats' politicization of the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.", "response": "FALSE."}

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

Union President Randi Weingarten delivered that battle cry during an address to union members, adding fresh tension to fraught schoolhouse debates as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden take sides on opposite ends of the fight.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-07-28\nTitle: National Teachers Union Backs 'Safety Strikes' in Cases of Lax ...\nContent:\nThe announcement comes about a month before school districts across the U.<strong>S</strong>. are scheduled to resume classes\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, discusses the concept of teacher strikes and the potential impact on schools.

The NEA will support any affiliate that chooses to strike in response to unsafe learning and teaching conditions, while the AFT has already approved backing local \"safety strikes\" on a case-by-case basis. The Florida Education Association (FEA), a local chapter of both NEA and AFT, mentioned that Florida teachers are not allowed to strike due to constitutional restrictions.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-07-28, focuses on the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) threatening to support \"safety strikes\" if specific criteria are not met to protect educators in districts reopening for in-person education.

But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines.\nThe only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example.\nBut posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past.\nOther posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates. In reality, no mRNA versions of an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in any country, according to our research, although some non-mRNA designs have been rolled out in places such as China.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories: The need for ...\nContent:\nWe also identified other misinformation related to children and soldiers dying after receiving the vaccine in multiple countries; it was reported on Facebook that seven children died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Senegal. Lastly, it was falsely reported that Bill Gates had said that 700,000 people would be injured or die from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Tim Nguyen, the head of high impact events preparedness unit at WHO, “You need to have a certain degree of good information out there to reach populations so that they are inoculated and not susceptible to fake news or disinformation…we believe we need to vaccinate 30% of the population with good information in order to have a certain degree of herd immunity against misinformation” [48]. Websites that provide evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines should be developed and disseminated globally as the use of such trusted sources of information have been found effective against misinformation and conspiracy theories [11].\nRumors about the use of vaccination campaigns for political purposes are not new, and such rumors have previously affected vaccination campaigns in some countries, such as Pakistan [38]. During a public health emergency, when there is considerable scientific uncertainty, and political leaders act as frontline crises managers, it often becomes challenging to ensure evidenced-based recommendation over political interest [35]. For example, the statement, “Whether the vaccine comes or not, coronavirus will leave the country” made by a health minister is likely to confuse the public about the necessity of the vaccine [39]. It thus may affect vaccine acceptancy. The claim that vaccine against COVID-19 had already been invented may lead some to come to the conclusion that this pandemic was being used in an attempt to further vaccine sales [40, 41]. Such misinformation may lead to mistrust on pharmaceutical companies, healthcare agencies and emergency responders and impact overall vaccine acce\n43. ABC News.

He told Forbes: “We moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that.” ... False. There is no evidence to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned, and the similarity in the numbers between the newspaper’s publication, the 9/11 feature and the Pfizer vaccine announcement do not give rise to this. The Bill Gates quote on the front of the newspaper has also been taken out of context.\nNow, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.” The paper then refers to the billionaire businessman as “Billy ‘the kid killer’ Gates” (here) . Accompanying the photo of the newspaper is a post from the Facebook user, in which she suggests there is a link between the 9/11 teaser and the Nov. 9, 2020 announcement from pharmaceutical company Pfizer that its vaccine for COVID-19 is more than 90% effective (here) .

The claim originated from a Facebook post by Irina Maryanchik on March 7, 2020. World health experts have stated that heat and sun exposure through the use of baths and saunas do not prevent or kill the novel coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the heat sensitivity of viruses and how heat is used to deactivate viruses in vaccines. The temperature range of 55 to 65°C for 15 to 30 minutes is reported to deactivate a range of enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-21, states that saunas can kill coronaviruses based on the temperature range of 150-175 degrees F for traditional saunas and 120-140 degrees F for infrared saunas. The Alaska Department of Health recommends maintaining a temperature of 160 degrees F for 30 to 60 minutes after vacating the sauna.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-04-12, states that a 20-minute trip to the sauna will not sweat the COVID-19 virus out of your body and that people should self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus. Breathing hot air from a blow dryer won't kill the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not provided, states that traditional saunas are generally in the range of 150-175 degrees F and infrared saunas use a lower temperature of 120-158 degrees F. Both traditional and infrared sauna temperatures will kill coronaviruses based on extrapolation from other coronaviruses.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. This has been debunked by experts in infectious disease epidemiology and world health experts. While it is true that heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Coronaviruses are generally sensitive to heat and can be inactivated at temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 15 minutes\" (WHO, 2020). However, this does not mean that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that 15 minutes in a sauna will kill the coronavirus is false. While heat can deactivate coronaviruses, the specific claim about 15 minutes in a sauna is not accurate. It is important to follow guidelines from the WHO and other health organizations to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReferences:\n\nFact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus | Lead Stories.

Their technique, detailed in a paper published this month in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology, could help regions manage risks to avoid scenarios like the recent outbreak in New York City, where the virus inflicted devastation on one of the most densely populated areas in the country. Knowing that COVID-19 is easily spread by individuals in close proximity, Chong and his team developed a method that helps them identify the most crowded areas with hustle and bustle, such as a city center, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people.\nUnlike contact tracing applications that are often difficult to deploy and require widespread adoption, his approach protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users. “Our method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps,” Chong said. “All we have to do is perform the measurements using anonymous data that is already being collected for other reasons. We are not tracking individuals.” · As the nation steps up efforts to plan for future outbreaks, Chong said their technique has applications beyond COVID-19. “It can help with other epidemiological risks, such as the flu.\nIn the fight against COVID-19, researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading the disease.

Crowded regions with actively moving people (called at-risk regions) are susceptible to spreading the disease, especially if they contain asymptomatic infected people together with healthy people.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 4, and 5 all discuss a study conducted by researchers at Colorado State University, led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Edwin Chong. The researchers developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy is detailed in a paper published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020 (Alsaeedy & Chong, 2020). The technique they developed helps identify the most crowded areas, where asymptomatic carriers have a higher probability of coming into close contact with large numbers of healthy people. This method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps as it protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users.\n\nInformation 3 provides additional context about the underlying technologies and privacy concerns related to using mobile networks for tracking movements of people and relating them to the spread of COVID-19. It mentions a paper by Alsaeedy and Chong (2020) that explores performance indicators in a network to determine how crowded certain cells in a mobile network are and monitor their mobility with neighboring cells, to assess the risk of COVID-19 spread.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim is TRUE. The researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy was published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020.\n\nReference:\nAlaa A. R. Alsaeedy, Edwin K. P. Chong.

Although the performance of these products is most commonly defined as a function of their alcohol concentration, they are multifaceted products in which an interplay of several factors is important in determining efficacy.\nPreventative measures for minimizing ocular exposure while using ABHS have been proposed [92]. The high use of ABHS during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been reported to be a possible cause of disulfiram alcohol reactions [93,94]. However, it has been proposed that inadvertent inhalation (especially if ABHS are used in poorly ventilated areas) rather than topical absorption is more likely to result in high enough amounts of alcohol exposure to elicit a disulfiram reaction [95].\nKeywords: hand sanitizers, alcohol, hand hygiene, tetrahedron, antiseptic, COVID-19 · Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have emerged as an important tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1].

Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.\nIn comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly. \"Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,\" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.\nResearchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.\nThe asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-10-30\nTitle: Covid-19 antibodies diminish over time, but experts say there's ...\nContent:\nIn the recent study published in Science, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a database of immune responses from 30,000 New Yorkers who tested positive for the coronavirus between March and October and monitored 121 volunteers over time.\nIn the U.K. study, scientists at Imperial College London found that antibody prevalence in the British participants fell from 6 percent at roughly the end of June to 4.4 percent in September. And using at-home tests that were distributed to more than 365,000 people, the researchers observed a more than 26 percent decline in antibody levels over three months.\nBut despite the seemingly divergent results from the two studies, they can both be true, according to Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the molecular microbiology and immunology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not unreasonable — or particularly alarming — if antibody levels decline rapidly after a person recovers and then persist for some time at a much lower level, he said.\nBelgian student Lili Deneve, who has recovered from Covid-19, donates plasma at the Belgian Red Cross blood collection center in Brussels on Oct. 27, 2020.Francois Lenoir / Reuters ...

Information 3 discusses a Chinese study where researchers observed that antibodies in COVID-19 patients fade quickly, which contrasts with antibodies to other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. The study suggests that this finding might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 \"immunity passports\" and supports the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups, and widespread testing.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be revised to reflect that a Chinese study found antibodies in COVID-19 patients fade quickly, rather than attributing the claim to a U.S. study.", "response": "TRUE."}

Coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses named for the crown-like spikes on the virus. SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses, but many of these viruses cause illnesses like the common cold.\nSome Lysol and Clorox products are already proven to fight some strains of coronaviruses. This year’s Novel Coronavirus, otherwise labeled 2019-ncov, hasn’t been around long enough for companies to test the effectiveness of sprays or wipes. Much of how the virus spreads remains unknown, which contributes to public concerns about the epidemic as cases top 20,000 in China.\nSome corners of the Internet are crafting conspiracy theories, claiming that America knew about the coronavirus before it was publicized, and that’s why the companies are able to list the virus on their packaging. It’s important to keep in mind when searching for information online that this year’s coronavirus is not the only one out there.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-02-27, explains that Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels that mention the \"Human Coronavirus.\" However, these labels refer to previously identified strains of the human coronavirus, not the new strain behind the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos are misleading by suggesting that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-01-31, discusses false claims on social media that Clorox and Lysol already knew about the new coronavirus. These claims arise from disinfectant product labels listing \"Human Coronavirus,\" which has led to confusion about the different strains of the virus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-06, reiterates the previous information that disinfectant products were tested against a strain of coronavirus that causes the common cold, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-03-13, provides a list of disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), but it does not mention Lysol or Clorox products specifically.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-02-05, clarifies that some Lysol and Clorox products can fight some strains of coronaviruses, but they have not specifically tested their products against the new 2019-nCoV strain.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that a bottle of disinfectant from 2015 shows coronavirus, suggesting that the virus is not new, is not entirely accurate. According to the provided information, Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels mentioning \"Human Coronavirus,\" but they refer to previously identified strains, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos have misleadingly suggested that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially false, as it incorrectly implies that the label on the 2015 disinfectant bottle refers to the new COVID-19 strain. It is crucial to understand that the \"Human Coronavirus\" mentioned on disinfectant product labels refers to previously identified strains, not the new strain that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

The posts and images on social media claim that the ventilators are not being distributed to hospitals, accompanied by a photo of ventilators in a warehouse. The photo was taken on March 24, 2020, during a press conference held by mayor Bill de Blasio at the New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) warehouse in Brooklyn.\n\nNew York agencies and officials in charge of ventilator deployment have contradicted the claim, stating that the ventilators were received and transferred by the agency within 24 hours. The photo, taken by Scott Lynch for Gothamist, shows 400 ventilators that were received and transferred by NYCEM within a day.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nGiven the information presented, the claim that the ventilators are stuck in a warehouse is false.

A US$15 million grant towards the trial was awarded to Novavax by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 2665 healthy adults and nearly 240 medically stable, HIV-positive adults will be enrolled. “The major motivation for COVID-19 vaccines being evaluated at an early stage in South Africa is to generate evidence in the African context on how well these vaccines work in settings such as our own”, says principle investigator of the Novavax clinical trial Shabir Madhi, Wits Professor of Vaccinology.\nThe first trial, also led by Madhi, of a COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa commenced on June 23, which was the first vaccine candidate to be tested in Africa. This trial (Ox1Cov-19 Vaccine VIDA trial) is in collaboration with Oxford University and the Jenner Institute.\nVaccine development and trials emerged as a key research priority for COVID-19 in Africa, after a consultation was released in April, led by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) based in South Africa and the African Union Development Agency (formerly known as NEPAD), involving more than 600 researchers and policy makers.\nIn the quest to provide appropriate vaccines to its people, in July the African Union (AU) launched a new consortium to bring together global vaccine developers, funders, and African organisations that conduct clinical trials.

In February, they began diving into these data. “We started to look at cells from tissues such as the lining of the nasal cavity, the lungs, and gut, based on reported symptoms and where the virus has been detected,” says Ordovas-Montanes.\nInterferon actually turned on the ACE2 gene at higher levels, potentially giving the virus new portals to get in. Is interferon alpha — normally a defense — helping SARS-CoV-2 infect cells? (Nevit Dilmen/Wikimedia Commons) “ACE2 is also critical in protecting people during various types of lung injury,” notes Ordovas-Montanes. “When ACE2 comes up, that’s usually a productive response.

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics.

The Gateses said that increased investment in vaccines by governments and the private sector could help developing countries dramatically reduce child mortality by the end of the decade, and they called for others to help fill critical financing gaps in both research funding and childhood immunization programs.\nThe foundation used a model developed by a consortium led by the Institute of International Programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to project the potential impact of vaccines on childhood deaths over the next 10 years. By significantly scaling up the delivery of life-saving vaccines in developing countries to 90 percent coverage—including new vaccines to prevent severe diarrhea and pneumonia—the model suggests that we could prevent the deaths of some 7.6 million children under 5 from 2010-2019. The foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million.\nThe foundation also estimates that an additional 1.1 million children could be saved with the rapid introduction of a malaria vaccine beginning in 2014, bringing the total number of potential lives saved to 8.7 million. If additional vaccines are developed and introduced in this decade—such as for tuberculosis—even more lives could be saved. The new funding announced today is in addition to the $4.5 billion that the Gates Foundation has already committed to vaccine research, development and delivery to date across its entire disease portfolio since its inception.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2011-11-02\nTitle: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again\nContent:\nBill’s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle’s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control—among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them—Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes.\nThe first Gates vaccine donation, $100 million, ­directed at the United Nations and ­administered by PATH, focused on getting existing vaccines to kids. To celebrate the gift, Bill and Melinda hosted a dinner for vaccine experts at their 66,000-square-foot home on Lake Washington. After Gates asked his guests, “What could you do if you had even more money?” the room exploded with new ideas. That’s when he decided to blow up his original foundation and, in 1999, reconstitute it as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, endowed with $21 billion, instantly making it one of the largest charities in the world.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn.\nBut those efforts still fell woefully short of the need, and new medicines hitting the U.S. market faced an intolerable 15-to-20-year lag before reaching the kids of Tanzania or Nicaragua. “The chance of death from those diseases is 50 times greater in poor kids than in rich kids!” says Gates, his voice rising.\n\nInformation 1 and 2 both discuss the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death. These articles, published in December 2020, state that these claims are not legitimate and that Bill Gates has never said that people should be forced to take the vaccine. The articles also clarify that the 1-in-10,000 chance of death statistic is taken out of context from the Pfizer vaccine trial, where two out of 21,000 trial participants who received the vaccine died, but not as a result of the vaccine.\n\nInformation 3, published in January 2021, debunks a separate claim that Bill Gates said \"at least 3 billion people need to die.\" This claim is also not supported by any evidence.\n\nInformation 4 and 5 provide context about Bill Gates' involvement in vaccine development and distribution. They show that Gates and his foundation have a history of committing significant resources to the research, development, and delivery of vaccines for the world's poorest countries.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim that Bill Gates is calling for mandatory vaccinations of all people and that those who receive the vaccine will face a 1-in-10,000 chance of death is false.

Talks are going on involving the General Medical Council, the Medical Schools Council (MSC), the individual medical schools, the BMA's UK Medical Student Committee, and the NHS to work out the best way to fast-track the medical students, who would normally be starting work as junior doctors on August 1st.

Consequently, they are unable to complete their clerkships [6]. Medical training through clinical rotations has been suspended [7]. Other challenges include a fear that medical students may contract the virus during their training and may transmit it to the community [8].

Others put their effort into community projects - reminding us of why we came to medical school. Many medical students came together to combine efforts into M-Response Corps, which has been pivotal in providing volunteer opportunities to support the hospital and community, providing care such as babysitting, PPE training for hospital staff, collecting community donations, or sitting bed side of patients who are at end of life.\nFirst year medical students have adapted to completing the rest of their first year curriculum virtually - a transition made logistically possible and practical by an existing U-M Medical School capacity for students to stream lectures remotely. Combined with the adaptation for taking quizzes and exams remotely and the adjustment of in-person curricular activities to remote options or postponement until later in the medical curriculum, the first year medical curriculum has continued without significant disruption to the usual timeline of instruction. However, the additional stressors brought about by COVID-19, as well as the loss of in-person cohort experiences that would normally see M1s solidifying friendships, has made this time particularly challenging for first year students.\nHowever, the additional stressors brought about by COVID-19, as well as the loss of in-person cohort experiences that would normally see M1s solidifying friendships, has made this time particularly challenging for first year students.

Not only did they not make proactive efforts, they also refused offers to buy vaccines.” According to Pfizer, Brazil rejected its offer to sell Brazil 70 million doses of its vaccine in August 2020.\nBut the federal government offered almost no funding or support for those efforts, according to Fernando Aith, a public health professor at the University of Sao Paulo.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports. Despite the decrease in EVALI with the arrival of COVID-19, EVALI should still be considered a differential diagnosis for people with COVID-19 for reasons outlined in this review.\nAlthough easily forgotten in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a major outbreak of vaping-related illness dominated public health concerns before the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. This narrative review describes vaping devices, summarizes the adverse health effects of vaping on the lungs and other systems, considers the potential interplay between vaping and COVID-19, and highlights gaps in knowledge about vaping that warrant further research.\nHospitalizations for EVALI reached a peak in late 2019 and rapidly declined to extremely low numbers of reported cases by January 2020, just before the initial identification of COVID-19 cases in the United States.47 Although vaping-related illness may have nearly disappeared as a consequence of increased public awareness resulting in risk reduction by users and by removal of vitamin E acetate from vaping products, a case report of a patient in April 2020 reminds clinicians that EVALI should remain in the differential diagnosis for young patients admitted with severe lung injury.48 Presenting symptoms of EVALI (dyspnea, cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) overlap with those of COVID-19,36,49,50 and during population surges of the pandemic there is a tendency to narrow diagnostic considerations.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is about a false claim on Facebook where pictures of a crying child and two adults in hospital beds were shared with the claim that the family members are infected with COVID-19.

These changes are part of the rollout of Government efforts to reduce alcohol consumption under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-29, addresses a false claim that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has issued a strict ban on the consumption, sale, and purchase of alcohol.

Several widely shared letters by small groups of scientists from different countries pushed strongly in the direction of a natural origin, calling suggestions that COVID-19 emerged in a lab a conspiracy theory.\nChinese officials have consistently rejected not only the hypothesis that the virus originated at the Wuhan laboratory, but that it originated in China at all. Additionally, Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn’t leak from her laboratory. (In April 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health pulled funding for a research project on coronaviruses in which the Wuhan institute was a chief partner.) Meanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States.\nMeanwhile, Beijing has called on the WHO to investigate the possibility that the pandemic started in other countries, including in the United States. The accusations come amid tensions between Washington and Beijing. Throughout 2020, the Donald Trump administration repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic, adding further friction to a relationship already strained by a trade war and U.S. responses to China’s rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, among other issues.\nMany critics say Trump’s use of inflammatory rhetoric such as “China virus” and “kung flu” contributed to a rise in anti-Asian bias in the United States amid the pandemic. President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts. On February 1, 2020, the People's Bank of China announced it would temporarily suspend the inclusion of mortgage and credit card payments in the credit record of people impacted by the pandemic.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The COVID lab-leak hypothesis: what scientists do and don’t know\nContent:\nDebate over the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged from a laboratory has escalated over the past few weeks, coinciding with the annual World Health Assembly, at which the World Health Organization (WHO) and officials from nearly 200 countries discussed the COVID-19 pandemic.

Disclosure: Anna Sayburn has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. For decades, we've been promised that telemedicine will save primary care money and time. Yet somehow, for most NHS GP services, face-to-face consultations have remained standard operating procedure. Why go to the hassle of introducing video consultations, when everyone can pop down to the surgery? The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly changed all that.\nProfessor Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, has produced a guide on introducing video consultation for practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. She agrees that infrastructure is a problem: \"Some of them [GPs] are making it work and some are really struggling because they haven't got the infrastructure. Infrastructure issues are going to be mission critical.\" The move to online working has exposed weaknesses in the technology available to primary care, says Dr Jameel.\nBut do remote consultations work as well as face-to-face visits, even when the technology is in place?

One of the more comprehensive looks at this topic was a systematic review of telemedicine practice in primary care before the pandemic, including 81 studies conducted both domestically and abroad.30 The results from this study have been supplemented by other publications conducted during the pandemic, and general conclusions about patient outcomes for different categories of careare summarized below.\nThe typical model for direct-to-consumer telemedicine is a single encounter between a clinician and patient who have no preceding relationship, and the clinician is often limited by lack of on-site testing, no means to bring patient in for a face-to-face examination, and little way to ensure the patient will access follow-up care if they get worse. Telemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.\nTelemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care. An observational study in this type of setting (a large integrated health system) analyzed more than 1 million visits: telephone, video, and office visits, for any type of initial concern (excluding routine physical examination) during a 2-year period.\nIt seems clear thattelemedicine is likely to remain pervasive in some fashion, and this author’s review of telemedicine both prepandemic and during the pandemic shows that it is widely agreeable to those who use it and it can stand alongside standard care for a variety of acute and chronic medical conditions, with the opportunity for more research ready to be explored in the future.

The source states that they have received many questions about this image and they are addressing the issue.\n\nInformation 3: This information is about the historical figure Nicolás Salmerón, who was a president of the First Spanish Republic.

In reality, the union had called medical suppliers nationwide in an effort to find masks — and it never had or hid them. A California health care workers’ union launched a nationwide search on March 21 for face masks and other protective gear that have been in short supply since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the U.S. On March 26, the union announced that it had found a supplier with 39 million masks.\nAnother meme went further, claiming: “SEIU was CAUGHT HIDING 39 MILLION N95 MASKS The SEIU only ‘found’ the much-needed masks after Atty. Gen. Barr threatened to file charges against them. People suspect SEIU was hiding the masks to cause a shortage / hurt Trump’s re-election.” · None of that is true. The SEIU-UHW never had the masks. Rather, in an effort to answer the concerns of the health care workers the union represents, the SEIU-UHW started calling suppliers and distributors to locate equipment, according to the union’s announcement.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-02\nTitle: California union didn’t hoard millions of protective masks | AP News\nContent:\nCLAIM: Just three days after Attorney General William Barr announced the Department of Justice will prosecute hoarders of personal protective equipment needed to combat the coronavirus, a California union suddenly located a stockpile of 39 million N95 masks. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. That’s not what happened. The United Health Care Workers West chapter of the Service Employees International Union simply connected state governments and hospitals to a vendor.\nOn March 23, President Donald Trump signed an order making it a crime to stockpile personal protective equipment needed by medical workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Barr also announced his agency was investigating people who were hoarding or price gouging medical supplies. Three days later, the Services Employees International Union chapter announced it was connecting several counties in California, the state, and hospital networks with a vendor that could provide 39 million N95 masks.

Last month, Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) announced it had found a distributor to provide 39 million N95 masks and would make them available to state and local governments and health care systems that are fighting the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\"As far as we knew, he had legitimate masks and the people who were going to purchase those masks were going to fully vet it and check it out and do their due diligence,\" spokesman Steve Trossman told the Times. Trossman told the Times the union \"was trying to save the lives of healthcare workers and patients,\" and its officials \"were proud of having made that attempt.\" Brady told the Times the arrangement was suspect because the 39 million N95 masks were purportedly coming from 3M, who had told federal investigators it manufactured only 20 million such masks last year.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Union That Promised 39 Million N95 Masks Was Scammed, FBI Says ...\nContent:\nOn March 26, a powerful California union released a statement saying it had “located 39 million critically needed N95 masks and is connecting states, counties, health systems and individual hospitals to the supplier so they can purchase them in quantity.” · The Service Employees International Union – United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) bragged that it had “launched an exhaustive search for masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) five days ago in response to pleas from frontline healthcare workers that they need more protection and feel unsafe on the job as they treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients.\nThe Service Employees International Union – United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) bragged that it had “launched an exhaustive search for masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) five days ago in response to pleas from frontline healthcare workers that they need more protection and feel unsafe on the job as they treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients.

The first-ever national state of emergency was decreed on October 25, 2020, primarily to introduce a curfew from midnight until six in the morning in order to tackle the widespread between young people in social gatherings. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court of Spain ruled that both COVID states of alarm had been unconstitutional.\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose. Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur. The state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published in 2018, refers to a video of a deer and 12 dogs falling off a cliff, which caused outrage on social media in Spain.\n* Information 2, published in 2020, mentions a video of a deer on a beach that has been circulating online since 2015, with claims that it was filmed in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown, or in Sri Lanka or India during their lockdowns.\n* Information 3, published in 2020, is a Royal Decree declaring the state of alarm in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which allows the government to adopt measures to tackle the pandemic and report to the Congress of Deputies.\n* Information 4, no publication date, refers to a video of a deer and 12 dogs falling into a ravine, which caused outrage on social media in Spain.\n* Information 5, published in 2023, states that the state of alarm declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic was unconstitutional, and it was the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a video of a deer in the sea was recorded during the state of alarm decree in Spain is false. The video mentioned in the claim is likely the same video referred to in Information 1 and 4, which shows a deer and 12 dogs falling into a ravine, not a deer in the sea. Furthermore, the video has been circulating online since 2015, which predates the state of alarm decree in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this case, it’s seamless merging of fact and fantasy. All of the 19 CEOs in the meme have, in fact, stepped down from their posts. That’s not fake. But their departures had nothing to do with coronavirus, and many took place long before the first COVID-19 cluster was identified.\nAccording to Business Insider, the CEO of the tobacco company Altria, Howard Willard, resigned due to complications from contracting the illness; while the head of SeaWorld recently resigned due to the financial hit the park was taking from having to close down; and there are rumors that Disney head Bob Iger unexpectedly stepped down over a year before his planned retirement because he knew how bad the pandemic would be. And there’s another conspiracy that Q believers have ignored entirely—one that’s already been proven to have come true.\nSo yes, while more CEOs have resigned in the last few years than since the Great Recession, most were in the works long before the coronavirus pandemic hit. They had nothing to do with the actual pandemic—and not the behind-the-scenes war between good and evil that Q believers talk about. The real conspiracies—be it insider trading or that “man of the people” Donald Trump made a great number of rich people more wealthy who are now they are cashing out before things collapse—apparently just isn’t as fun.\nAnd we’re all too distracted by the torrent of pandemic headlines to realize what’s really going on here: Deep state-aligned industry titans are running for the hills before they’re brought down by President Donald Trump and his team of patriots. Supposedly. Check this out. No coincidences. All these CEO resignations within 48 hours…\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2018-01-25\nTitle: What CEO Resignations Reveal | Recent CEO Resignations\nContent:\nOn December 7, 2021, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker announced his resignation. Parker had served as an airline CEO for 20 years. The company’s president, Robert Isom, will take over on March 31. Parker will serve as Chairman of the carrier’s board. “It likely would have happened sooner, but the global pandemic — and the devastating impact it had on our industry — delayed those plans,” Parker stated in a note to his employees.\nOn January 20, 2021, Michael Pack, CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media including Voice of America resigned at President Biden’s request, two hours after being sworn in. Often accused for partisanship, Pack pointed fingers at journalists for anti-Trump bias. He initiated investigations into bias claims and tried to sack senior “deep state” executives.\nUnfortunately, many CEO’s are misaligned with corporate objectives. Some make poor or even fatal decisions under stress. Others allow their character flaws to spin out of control. Too many CEO’s sabotage their own best efforts and fail to bring their best selves to the workplace. They can experience untold embarrassment, despair, and untimely resignations.\nSilbermann shared “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see… Bill is a great leader for this transition.” · On June 22, 2022, Jose Mauro Coelho, the CEO of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras stepped down.

The post claimed that a series of CEO resignations before the novel coronavirus outbreak were linked to a global conspiracy. The post was debunked as false by fact-checkers, who pointed out that there was no evidence to support the claim and that many of the CEOs mentioned had not actually stepped down from their positions.\n\nInformation 3 is about a different claim, made in December 2021, that a series of high-level corporate resignations were linked to the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. This claim was also debunked as false by fact-checkers, who found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nInformation 4 provides additional context about the claim made by Cody Harris. It explains that while some of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim were real, they had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or any global conspiracy. Instead, they were due to a variety of factors, including personal health issues and company financial problems.\n\nInformation 5 is not directly related to the claim made by Cody Harris, but it provides some general context about CEO resignations. It notes that some CEOs resign due to poor decision-making, character flaws, or political pressure.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim made by Cody Harris that CEO resignations are linked to a global conspiracy is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and many of the CEO resignations mentioned in the claim have been debunked as false. Additionally, the fact that some CEOs resign for a variety of reasons unrelated to any conspiracy supports the conclusion that the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

But like the Mahoneys, he acknowledges that “everyone has good intentions,” grappling with the challenges of treating a horrific, widespread, and little-understood disease.\nI cleaned him up before we drove to the vet and stayed with him in the back seat. I said, ‘I will have your voice heard, for all our furry friends. Your voice will be heard, Buddy.’ ” · One of those furry friends is Duke, the Mahoney’s surviving dog.

And at the time, Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people in the trial were likely to have encounters with non-mask wearers.For more, see \"Danish Study Doesn’t Prove Masks Don’t Work Against the Coronavirus,\" Nov.\nAnd at the time, Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people in the trial were likely to have encounters with non-mask wearers.For more, see \"Danish Study Doesn’t Prove Masks Don’t Work Against the Coronavirus,\" Nov. 25, 2020Fauci followed science, CDC recommendations on masking Claim: \"Fauci lied\" about face masks when he wrote in a Feb. 5, 2020, email that \" are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection.\"Facts: Fauci’s public statements early in the pandemic on masking have been repeatedly distorted.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. A Danish study, DANMASK-19, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine on November 18, 2020. The study found that face masks provide limited protection to the wearer against COVID-19 infection. The study involved 6,024 adults who were divided into two groups, one wearing face masks and one control group. After one month, 1.8% of the people wearing masks had been infected, while 2.1% of the people in the control group had tested positive. The study's findings were inconclusive and did not prove that masks offer no protection from COVID-19.\n2. The DANMASK-19 trial was an investigator-initiated, nationwide, unblinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in Denmark in April and May 2020. The trial assessed whether a recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others reduced wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where public health measures were in effect but community mask wearing was uncommon and not recommended.\n3. The findings from the DANMASK-19 trial suggest that masks provide the wearer with limited protection. However, these findings do not suggest masks are useless in curbing the coronavirus' spread. Experts have urged the public to wear masks to prevent the wearer from unknowingly spreading the virus to other people.\n4. Social media posts have inaccurately described the results of the DANMASK-19 trial as \"conclusive\" and that masks \"don't work.\" However, the authors of the study specifically wrote that their findings were \"inconclusive.\"\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a Danish study proves masks offer no protection from COVID is false. The DANMASK-19 trial found that masks provide limited protection to the wearer against COVID-19 infection, not that masks offer no protection at all. The study's findings were inconclusive and did not prove that masks are useless in curbing the coronavirus' spread. Social media posts have inaccurately described the results of the study, leading to misunderstandings about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) has also occurred in some people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (also virally delivered).\nAnecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection: Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels · Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord · Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently\nResearch shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nBecause COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder.

The etiology of COVID-19 catatonia has not yet been extensively explored. Authors have theorized that this rare presentation could be iatrogenic in etiology or be caused by the severe mental stress patients must deal with whilst in the ICU. Furthermore, a condition that some scientists have argued to have neuropsychiatric elements is “Long COVID” [61]. Some researchers believe Long COVID is like functional neurological illnesses including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) [66]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms patients with Long COVID might experience include depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits [67]. Data collected from the U.K’s COVID-19 infection survey [68] estimates that around 10% of people who test positive for the virus experience Long COVID, that is, symptoms that last for greater\nThe above conditions primarily affect the upper and lower limbs. What is interesting is that literature has also identified a link between COVID-19 affecting peripheral nerves of the head and neck. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries motor fibers to the muscles of facial expression, parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, and special sensory fibers to supply taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue [75]. In facial nerve palsy, patients typically present with total unilateral paralysis of the muscles supplied by CNVII, ptosis, and lacrimal/salivary gland disturbances.\nThis review will initially focus on the most common benign neurological complications of COVID-19, followed by the more serious ones observed. Complications involving the central and peripheral nervous system will be discussed, along with neuropsychiatric effects as they sit on the border between neurological and psychiatric disease. For completeness, some of the rarest and most interesting neurological complications documented will be reviewed.\nCOVID-19 can also cause complications within the venous vasculature, again resulting in neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular complications of the venous system are much rarer than arterial. However, one of the more serious venous complications seen in COVID-19 patients is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [44-46]. This is where a thrombus forms within the venous vasculature of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and even the jugular foramen.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-29\nTitle: Two rare neurologic conditions linked to COVID-19 | MDedge ...\nContent:\nTwo rare neurologic conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 add more evidence that unusual neurologic manifestations can arise in patients infected with the virus.

There was no such adjustment. Florida has become a focal point in the nation’s struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19. More than 460,000 people have tested positive for infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in that state, including over 6,500 who have died, according to the Florida Department of Health.

Two tests were positive for COVID-19 infection. Since then, the number of infected persons in Brazil has increased dramatically [14]. Physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 16th [5]. Events expected to attract large numbers of people were cancelled, universities and schools were closed, and only services considered essential to the population remained functional, such as markets, pharmacies and bakeries.\nTo document how the containment measures affected the lives of the Brazilian people, and to understand which containment measures were best adhered to by which strata of the population, we conducted an online survey on the adherence of the Brazilian people to individual public health measures and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives.\nIn another large online survey in Brazil conducted between April 24th and May 24th, assessing only the degree of adherence to physical contact restriction measures, greater adherence was found among females compared to males but it was mainly the 30 to 49 year old group that was less adherent and not the younger age group [23]. People living in rural areas and poor neighborhoods were also less adherent: in rural areas people may not perceive themselves at high risk of COVID-19, and therefore may not respect the national restriction measures and not practice individual hygiene measures [24]. Therefore, extra communication and health education may be needed to change the risk perception in rural areas and popular neighborhoods [25]. Brazilian students reported difficulties to stay home, which may be related to a need to travel to their original homes in periods when schools and universities were closed [26] or could be related to differing social habits among this population.\nThis is a concern, as older age and the presence of (an) underlying health condition(s) are associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality [30, 31] On the other hand, Brazilian respondents with underlying diseases adhered better to the containment measures.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Brazil's COVID-19 guidelines: political hijack of public health ...\nContent:\nBahia School of Medicine and Public Health, Salvador 40290-000, BrazilSearch for articles by this author ...

But they’re also symptoms of something you’ve been feeling a lot of lately: anxiety.  · So, do you have the coronavirus? Or are you having a panic attack? “There are some key differences, but there are also some symptoms that could overlap,” acknowledges Dr. Jennifer Erickson, a psychiatrist who sees patients at UW Medical Center – Montlake and the UW Neighborhood Clinics. What’s more, many people who are at heightened risk for a severe illness from COVID-19 are also more likely to experience anxiety, such as people who have an existing chronic illness.\nThere are a few key differences that happen during COVID-19 but not during anxiety, Erickson says.  · It’s important to pay attention to these because this is how you’ll know if what you’re experiencing is anxiety or something more medically serious. First, Erickson recommends checking your temperature. Try not to do this regularly — once a day will work. It’s pretty simple: If you don’t have a fever (usually defined as 100.4 degrees F or higher), your symptoms are probably caused by anxiety, not the coronavirus.\nIt’s pretty simple: If you don’t have a fever (usually defined as 100.4 degrees F or higher), your symptoms are probably caused by anxiety, not the coronavirus.

In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about how anxiety affects your body and the overlap of symptoms with COVID-19.\nPreliminary research suggests that COVID-19 can cause digestive symptoms including a loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. If you’re having a hard time determining if the tightness in your chest and shallow breathing are related to your increased anxiety or a potential sign of COVID-19, you’re not alone. Because we’re still learning about the coronavirus, we can’t know exactly what symptoms it causes for most people.\nAs things develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s one thing just about everybody has in common: A drastic increase in anxiety. Whether you’re worried about your health or the health of loved ones, trying to navigate sudden unemployment or wondering what happens next in the face of uncertainty, you’re not alone.

While vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the immune system, no food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus. However, having a healthy diet can support immune function.\n\nInformation 2, published on February 8, 2021, discusses a study by the University of Rochester Medical Center, revealing that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is a study on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in milk. The study found that pasteurization effectively eliminates infectious virus titers in milk.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 28, 2020, states that Chinese researchers found that exposure to human breast milk helps kill the virus that causes Covid-19. The World Health Organization recommends mothers continue breastfeeding even if they have COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, proposes the use of Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not accurate. According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19. However, these findings do not support the claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.\nFinally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system.

SARS-CoV-2 has spread in countries such as Singapore where the climate is humid and temperatures were higher than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Tens of thousands of people have been infected in Singapore, and as of May 8, more than 54,000 were infected in Africa. The coronavirus can spread in hot weather and has also spread in countries such as the UK where temperatures were cooler.\nShare this story: Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Linkedin\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Climate and the spread of COVID-19 | Scientific Reports\nContent:\nTo add evidence from a different perspective, we use global data to examine the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19 controlling for several important confounding factors. To this end, we regress the prevalence of COVID-19 (logarithmically transformed) at the country level against the latitude of a country.\nTo control for key confounders at the country-level, our analysis includes (1) data on air travel16 (to capture a possible way of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across countries but also the remoteness of a place, which might increase the need for air travel); (2) vehicle concentration17 and urbanization16 (to capture differences in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 within a country18); (3) COVID-19 testing intensity19,20 (to control for the vigor of a country’s COVID-19 response and for COVID-19 detection bias in cross-country comparisons21,22); (4) cell phone usage16 (to control for the speed at which information on behavior change for COVID-19 prevention travels within a country18,23); and (5) health expenditure (to capture differences in countries' commitment to population health); old-age dependency ratio (to capture cross-country differences in age structure and family compositions, which can affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2), and income16 (to control for differences in economi\nWHO’s warning that the virus spreads in all climates must still be taken seriously. At the time of revising this manuscript in January 2021, many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by an easier spread of COVID-19 in winter.\nIn sum, we show that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the threat of epidemic resurgence may increase during winter. However, our results do not indicate that the disease will vanish in summer, nor that countries located close to the equator will contain the disease without effective public health measures.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-24\nTitle: Will Heat Kill the COVID-19 Spread This Summer?\nContent:\nCan Coronavirus survive the heat? Could warm weather stop COVID-19 from circulating? Find out if the weather and heat can reduce or possibly end the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-31, is a fact-check by Poynter that debunks the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries. The claim originated from an anonymous letter stating that the virus can be fought off by eating chillies and ginger and can be destroyed at temperatures of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2018-01-25, explains that cold weather does not directly make people sick, and the misconception may come from the fact that people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other when it's cold, which can facilitate the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-11, states that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive and spread in warm climates, citing Singapore and Africa as examples where the virus has spread despite warm temperatures.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a study that examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for several confounding factors. The study found that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-24, discusses whether heat can kill the COVID-19 spread, but it does not provide a definitive answer.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries is false. The virus can survive and spread in warm climates, as evidenced by outbreaks in countries such as Singapore and Africa. Additionally, a study found that an increase in absolute latitude is associated with a higher number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates. Therefore, it is important to take WHO's warning that the virus spreads in all climates seriously and continue to follow public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.", "response": "FALSE."}

However, if the Government wants to extend the state of alarm beyond the initial fifteen days it needs authorization from the Congreso de Diputados (Congress of Deputies). During a state of alarm, the government can impose limitations to rights but not their suspension. This distinction has implications beyond the Spanish borders since only derogations of rights, rather than their limitation, need to be notified to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (for States that have notified Covid-related derogations see here) and the United Nations to fulfill relevant human rights obligations.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-07-05\nTitle: State of alarm (Spain) - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose. Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration. The decree will determine the territorial scope to which the effects of the declaration extend. The limitation of rights is regulated in the organic law 4/1981.\nThe second state of alarm was declared on March 14, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic. It enforced the lockdown of people in all Spanish territory. It ended on June 21, 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Beyond the State of Alarm: COVID-19 in Spain – Verfassungsblog\nContent:\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 (SC) includes a specific provision (Article 116) for the three so-called states of emergency – the state of alarm, state of exception, and state of siege – which shall be regulated by an Organic Law. The Government shall declare the state of alarm by decree, decided upon by the Council of Ministers, and shall specify the territorial area to which the effects of the proclamation shall apply. It can last up to 15 days at maximum and only be extended, with no limit, by the authorization of the Congress.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nThe information provided consists of five pieces from various sources, discussing the Spanish state of alarm and its relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of alarm is regulated by Article 116 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and Organic Law 4/1981. The government can declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it. The state of alarm allows the government to impose limitations on rights but not suspend them. This has implications for human rights obligations, as only derogations of rights need to be notified to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the United Nations.\n\nThe Spanish government declared a state of alarm on March 14, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, which enforced a lockdown of people in all Spanish territory. This state of alarm ended on June 21, 2020. During the state of alarm, the government can make use of the general authorization contained in Article 86.1 of the Spanish Constitution, which allows it to make legally binding rules in cases of \"extraordinary and urgent need,\" which are of a provisional nature until they are validated or repealed by the Congress of Deputies.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim states that the Spanish government asks Congress to renew the state of alarm every 15 days because it is required by law. Based on the provided information, the claim is partially correct. The Spanish government does declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it. However, the information does not explicitly state that the government \"asks Congress to renew the state of alarm every 15 days because it is required by law.\" Instead, it is implied that the government requests an extension after the initial 15-day period.\n\nConsidering the provided information and the publication date of the claim (2020-05-05), it is reasonable to assume that the claim is accurate, as the state of alarm was in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government would have needed to request extensions from the Congress of Deputies to maintain the state of alarm beyond the initial 15-day period.", "response": "FALSE."}

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, so mask-wearing and social distancing are important for curbing spread. While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies.

However, the information available does not support this claim. Information 1, 3, and 5 contradict the claim, stating that while houseflies can carry the virus, there is no evidence to suggest they can transmit it. Information 2 is a fact-check that debunks the claim, and Information 4, published after the claim, reports on a study showing that houseflies can carry the virus for up to 24 hours but does not provide evidence of transmission.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, as there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that houseflies can spread the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\". So what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter? It's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded.\nIt's a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market.\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-21\nTitle: Fact check: Did coronavirus originate in a Chinese laboratory?\nContent:\nWe have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\" We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.\nOne of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China. Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab · More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say · The article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”\nThese sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.\nThis is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, was dismissive of the theory of an accidental escape from a Chinese laboratory, USA TODAY reported on April 18.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-04-01\nTitle: Theory That COVID Came From A Chinese Lab Takes On New Life In ...\nContent:\nTheory That COVID Came From A Chinese Lab Takes On New Life In Wake Of WHO Report : Coronavirus Updates Some scientists worry the possibility the coronavirus escaped from research facilities hasn't gotten enough scrutiny. Others say it appears far more likely to have emerged naturally.\nA State Department fact sheet from mid-January highlights reports of sick lab researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the fall of 2019, notes the dangerous type of coronavirus research the lab was conducting and said there was also secret military activity at the lab. China has refuted the claims. Critics of the WHO report, such as Metzl, said the expert team that visited the lab took their Chinese interlocutors at their word and didn't dig.\n\"I think there were a lot of people who did put together the fact that you had an outbreak in Wuhan and you have these laboratories in Wuhan fairly immediately,\" said David Feith, who was an Asia adviser in the Trump administration's State Department when the coronavirus emerged.\nBefore COVID-19, few scientists would have pegged the city of Wuhan, in temperate central China, as a likely starting point for a global coronavirus pandemic.

But the city of 11 million straddling the Yangtze River is home to some of China's most advanced biological research laboratories.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published anonymously, discusses the debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China. It mentions that the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-04-13 by Chequeado, states that the coronavirus is not synthetic and was not created in a Chinese laboratory. It also mentions the importance of checking the publication date of fact-checks before sharing them.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2021-05-27 by BBC, discusses the Wuhan lab-leak theory and its re-emergence in 2023. It explains the suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan and the presence of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as a major biological research facility in the city. It also mentions an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the virus originating from Fort Detrick in Maryland.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-03-21 by USA TODAY, is a fact-check article that rates the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. It mentions that suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons were debunked.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2021-04-01 by NPR, discusses the Wuhan lab-leak theory and its resurgence in the wake of a WHO report. It highlights reports of sick lab researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the fall of 2019 and mentions China's refutation of the claims.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus is synthetic and was created in a Chinese laboratory is FALSE based on the available information. The WHO has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created. Additionally, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that the coronavirus is synthetic and was created in a Chinese laboratory is not supported by the available information. The WHO has stated that all available data suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not laboratory-created. Furthermore, scientific research has debunked suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons.\n\nWhile there is debate over the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory in China, the consensus among scientific experts is that the virus has an animal origin. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade, and the lab is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that the virus escaped from the WIV.\n\nIt is important to note that the publication date of the claim is 2020-04-13, while the publication date of Information 3 is 2021-05-27. Therefore, the claim was made before the re-emergence of the Wuhan lab-leak theory in 2023. However, even with this sequential relationship, the consensus among scientific experts remains that the virus has an animal origin.", "response": "FALSE."}

It actually wasn’t that long ago that people diagnosed with cancer — people like Ginsburg, me, and the more than 16 million Americans currently living with cancer — were called “cancer victims.” We were expected to hide in shame, and too often faced discrimination in the workplace and, of course, by health insurers who viewed us as either too risky or too expensive to provide coverage. ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be as much of a trailblazer for people living with cancer as she did for women, minorities, and free speech, among the many hot-button causes and cases she heard during her quarter-century on the high court.\nIn 2009, when diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the diminutive giant finished the draft of a speech on the flight to New York for her surgery; it would be delivered by someone else. Ten days after that surgery, Ginsburg was front and center at President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech. “And, truthfully, she looked like she had a grand time,” recalls Totenberg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us how to live a life full of meaning, connection, and love in the shadow of cancer.\nIn 1999, Ginsburg, then 66, was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated for it.

Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus.\nMany COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.

In these rare stem cells—the parents of immune-system cells—taken from people recovering from COVID-19, the scientists identified changes in the instructions for which genes got turned on or off. These changes were passed down to daughter cells, leading them to boost production of immune cells called monocytes. In the monocytes from people recovering from severe COVID-19, the changes in gene expression led the cells to pump out greater amounts of molecules called inflammatory cytokines than monocytes from people who were healthy or had non-COVID-19 illnesses.\nThese changes may help explain why the disease can damage so many different organs and why some people with long COVID have high levels of inflammation throughout the body. The findings were published online today in the journal Cell. Researchers led by Steven Z. Josefowicz, Ph.D., of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City examined immune cells and molecules in blood samples from 38 people recovering from severe COVID-19 and other severe illnesses, as well as from 19 healthy people.\nSevere COVID-19 may cause long-lasting alterations to the innate immune system, the first line of defense against pathogens, according to a small study funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. These changes may help explain why the disease can damage so many different organs and why some people with long COVID have high levels of inflammation throughout the body.

Here, immunostaining reveals increased levels of the adhesion molecule PECAM-1 on endothelial cells in brain tissue from patients who died from COVID-19.\nThe scientists found evidence that antibodies—proteins produced by the immune system in response to viruses and other invaders—are involved in an attack on the cells lining the brain’s blood vessels, leading to inflammation and damage. Consistent with an earlier study from the group, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the patients’ brains, suggesting the virus was not infecting the brain directly. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 can trigger brain damage may help inform development of therapies for COVID-19 patients who have lingering neurological symptoms.\nFor the first time, researchers observed deposits of immune complexes—molecules formed when antibodies bind antigens (foreign substances)—on the surface of endothelial cells in the brains of COVID-19 patients. Such immune complexes can damage tissue by triggering inflammation. The study builds on their previous research, which found evidence of brain damage caused by thinning and leaky blood vessels. They suspected that the damage may have been due to the body’s natural inflammatory response to the virus.\nNath and his team found that antibodies produced in response to COVID-19 may mistakenly target cells crucial to the blood-brain barrier. Tightly packed endothelial cells help form the blood-brain barrier, which keeps harmful substances from reaching the brain while allowing necessary substances to pass through. Damage to endothelial cells in blood vessels in the brain can lead to leakage of proteins from the blood.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells ...\nContent:\nLong-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Financial advisor Wrenne suggests that physicians should plan for a 6-month financial recovery, until October, before income returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. Reimbursement lags appointments by as much as 3 months, and it will probably take the economy 2 to 3 months more to get back to normal.\n\nRegarding the claim \"COVID-19: What Will Happen to Physician Income This Year?\" published on May 13, 2020, the information provided supports the claim that the physician income will be affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The publications discuss the uncertainty of physician income after May 15 and the expectation of a financial recovery taking months. Therefore, the claim is likely to be true based on the available information and expert opinions. However, it is essential to note that the situation is fluid, and the actual impact may vary depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the economic recovery.", "response": "TRUE."}

Chertow · Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—can involve the pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system1. A few studies have investigated cardiovascular outcomes in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19; however, most were limited to hospitalized individuals (who represent the minority of people with COVID-19), and all had a short duration of follow-up and a narrow selection of cardiovascular outcomes2,3,4,5.\nA comprehensive assessment of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae of the cardiovascular system at 12 months is not yet available, and studies of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae across the spectrum of care settings of the acute infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care) are also lacking. Addressing this knowledge gap will inform post-acute COVID-19 care strategies. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 153,760 US veterans who survived the first 30 d of COVID-19 and two control groups: a contemporary cohort consisting of 5,637,647 users of the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a historical cohort (pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic) consisting of 5,859,411 non-COVID-19-infected VHA users during 2017.\nCare strategies of people who survived the acute episode of COVID-19 should include attention to cardiovascular health and disease. The broader implications of these findings are clear. Cardiovascular complications have been described in the acute phase of COVID-19 (refs. 6,7,8). Our study shows that the risk of incident cardiovascular disease extends well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of COVID-19 infection on the cardiovascular system: An ...\nContent:\nThrough these direct and indirect mechanisms, the heart is at an increased risk of experiencing permanent damage in vulnerable population groups who become infected with COVID-19, often resulting in myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases [62]. Although there is no consensus on treating these conditions, the primary recommendation is to treat the patient's underlying conditions and any new conditions that may occur, including myocardial infarction. Some medical providers administer low–molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin in acutely ill patients to avoid clotting. Further studies have indicated that there may be some benefit to administering fibrinolytic therapy whenever possible over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially to avoid unnecessary “hardware” to a person that would otherwise not need it [64].\nAs kidney pathology has a functional interface with the cardiovascular system, it is not surprising that renal manifestations are thought to contribute to the short- and long-term cardiovascular events observed in COVID-19 patients [32,38]. When researchers in New Orleans evaluated 287 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, they found that patients with metabolic syndrome were 3.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals without metabolic syndrome [39]. These deadly outcomes are often related to cardiovascular events as metabolic syndromes significantly increase a person's risk of developing a spectrum of cardiovascular conditions, such as cardiac dysfunction, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, microvascular dysfunction, and heart failure [40]. The underlying mechanisms responsible for kidney and heart disease co-existence include leukocyte infiltration into the myocardium and increased cytokine secretions that contribute to myocardial inflammation, injury, an\nAlthough there is no consensus about the treatment of these conditions, the main recommendation is to address the underlying conditions of the patient and any new conditions, including myocardial infarction, that may arise. In acutely ill patients, some medical practitioners prescribe low–molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin to prevent clotting. Further studies have shown that delivering fibrinolytic therapy can be of some benefit.

The article states that these compounds are found in coffee and can stimulate compounds that can ward off the virus in humans with average immune systems. However, the article does not provide any scientific evidence to support this claim.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-13, is an article debunking the claim that coffee can cure COVID-19. The article states that while the compounds Methylxanthine, Theobromine, and Theophylline are found in coffee, they have not been scientifically or microbiologically proven to impact the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 5 does not directly relate to the claim but provides information about the methylxanthines caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, including their chemical components and toxicity to humans.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that drinking coffee helps fight the coronavirus because it contains the compounds Methylxanthine, Theobromine, and Theophylline is false. This is because there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that these compounds can fight the coronavirus. In fact, Information 1, 4, and the article from 2020-04-15 cited in Information 1 all debunk this claim.\n\nFurthermore, Information 2, while not directly debunking the claim, does not provide any scientific evidence to support it. The information provided in Information 5 about the chemical components and toxicity of the methylxanthines caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine does not support the claim either.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the lack of scientific evidence to support the claim, it is reasonable to classify the claim as FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

People with a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) have to visit their doctors regularly to monitor how well their lungs are working. This is often done using a spirometry test.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has limited regular doctor’s office visits. It has also raised safety concerns about the visits that do occur. For example, people using spirometers could spew infectious particles into the air.

It also mentions antibody tests, which involve drawing blood and testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody tests cannot determine current infection, as it takes one to three weeks after infection for the body to produce antibodies.\n\nInformation 2, published by Precision Medical, Inc., discusses how to test lung capacity at home, which is not related to COVID-19 testing.\n\nInformation 3, published by USA TODAY, debunks the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19, rating it as FALSE.\n\nInformation 4, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discusses monitoring lung function at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for people with chronic lung diseases. It mentions the use of spirometry tests to monitor lung health, but it does not mention COVID-19 self-testing.\n\nInformation 5, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), explains COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and what to do if sick. It also mentions self-tests and provides a video on what to do if the self-test result is positive.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that this is how to test your lung for COVID-19 self-check. However, none of the provided information supports this claim directly. Information 1 and 5 mention COVID-19 self-tests, but they do not specifically mention testing lungs. Instead, they explain the process of using a self-test, including collecting a specimen and performing the test. Information 3 debunks the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely referring to the use of a self-test for COVID-19, not specifically testing lung function. However, the claim is still misleading, as it implies that the self-test specifically checks lung function, which is not the case.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially true but mostly misleading.

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can.

The Prime Minister said that the president’s statement that “Belgrade’s graveyards won’t be big enough” if people ignore isolation and social distancing requirements have been twisted and manipulated to suggest that they were a threat.\nBrnabic said that the state of emergency was imposed to close schools, reduce non-essential movement and concentrate limited medical care and resources. “The Serbian Assembly went into recess because of social distancing requirements, in parliament’s absence, Mr. Vucic, the outgoing speaker of the assembly, and I, as prime minister, appropriately employed our joint constitutional prerogative to declare a state of emergency, which is limited to 180 days.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Ana Brnabić - Council of Women World Leaders\nContent:\n<strong>Prime</strong> <strong>Minister</strong> <strong>Ana</strong> Brnabić took office in 2017 as the first woman and LGBTQ person in Serbia to hold this position.

An alternative way of treatment could be the use of naturally derived molecules with known antiviral properties. We reviewed the antiviral activities of two polyphenols derived from tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea and theaflavins from black tea.\nA few dietary molecules with previously established antiviral activities are also among the candidates evaluated for COVID-19 treatment. In this article, we will review the activity of phytochemicals derived from green tea and black tea. Irrespective of the type of tea, a typical procedure for production of green tea and black tea involves 5 general processes.\nRecent studies have revealed the possible binding sites present on SARS-CoV-2 and studied their interactions with tea polyphenols. EGCG and theaflavins, especially theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) have shown a significant interaction with the receptors under consideration in this review. Some docking studies further emphasize on the activity of these polyphenols against COVID-19.\nEGCG is known to interact with the COVID-19 S protein GRP78 binding site, which is a druggable target, via hydrogen and non-bonded interactions, thus exhibiting its antiviral activity. Apart from these, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been established for these tea polyphenols.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ...

The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%.

U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. Information 5 is from the National Center for Health Statistics and provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 in the US.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that the total number of deaths in the US in 2020 is significantly down compared to previous years is false.

Respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\nCLAIM: CDC warns that non-N95 masks will do nothing to protect you from wildfire smoke because “they do not catch small particles.” Smoke particles are larger than those of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so masks do not work. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Cloth and surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching respiratory droplets coming from the person wearing the mask.\nThe CDC recently updated its guidance on wildfires to include information about the coronavirus.

The 2 m separation to avoid direct exposure and the risk assessment for indirect exposure, summarized in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5, provide valuable contextual information for safety policies in this scenario (face mask wearing is not an issue as they are seldom worn at home).\nAs we have argued, invoking a sharp increase of risk for a lack of reciprocal masking makes no sense in large open spaces and can be reasonably handled by recommending bystanders to wear face masks and avoid the area of direct exposure (see Figure 1). It can be argued that vapers could remain mask-free for periods longer than the duration of intermittent puffs when vaping, but this depends on the incentives that the social context to induce them (or for those who eat and drink) to remain mask-free.

The AP also states that respiratory droplets are larger than smoke particles.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, is a study about the aerial transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through aerosols. The study mentions that vaping and smoking produce aerosols with particulate matter in the submicron range, similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is a fact-check by PolitiFact stating that a video of a retired anesthesiologist blowing vapor from an electronic cigarette through a mask does not prove that masks don't work. PolitiFact also states that masks help protect against the passing of larger respiratory droplets that can carry the coronavirus.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\n\nBased on the given information, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false. Multiple sources, including AFP and PolitiFact, have fact-checked this claim and found it to be false. Experts agree that masks help stop the larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles and reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19. The fact that vape smoke can pass through a mask does not prove that masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim was published on 2021-02-05, while the fact-checks by AFP and PolitiFact were published on the same day and the day after, respectively. Therefore, the fact-checks were published in a timely manner and provide accurate information regarding the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus is false.

While Ebola in 2014 had some impact on the election, there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.\n\nThe claim leaves out the 2006 midterm election year and misrepresents the timeline of when the diseases became widespread. For example, SARS was first reported in November 2002 and had mostly subsided by the 2004 election year. Avian flu was first reported in 1996 and did not become widespread until 2004-2005. Swine flu was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, during the midterm election year of 2010. MERS was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but the largest number of cases were registered in 2014 and 2015. Ebola first appeared in 1976, but the largest outbreak was registered from 2014 until 2016 in West Africa. Zika was first identified in 1947, but the outbreak in the Americas did not begin until 2015. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the claim that every election year has a disease is false and misleading. It is an attempt to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggest that it is being hyped for political reasons.

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020–February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1).

National COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19.\nNational COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19. The mental health impact of COVID-19 also might have community-specific effects when morbidity and mortality rates are increasing as a result of COVID-19. Fluctuations in symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic highlight the importance of real-time monitoring of mental health symptoms.\nFifth, the decrease in the frequency of symptoms observed through June 2021 occurred before the recent surge in COVID-19 cases involving the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; that decreasing trend might have slowed or reversed since June. Finally, these data are based on self-report and are subject to recall and social desirability biases.

Researchers fed mice infected with the influenza virus a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which resulted in a higher survival rate than compared to those on a normal high-carbohydrate diet. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung and trapped the virus before it became worse.\nDuring the study, the team showed that mice infected with the flu virus that were fed the keto diet had a higher survival rate than mice on a high-carb normal diet. The researchers were more excited to find the details behind this event. The keto diet actually triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not. When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.\nThe two trainees are, Ryan Molony who found that immune system activators called inflammasomes can cause harmful immune system responses in their host, and Emily Goldberg who worked in Dixit's lab, which had shown that the ketogenic diet blocked formation of inflammasomes.

The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus.

For temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that these findings agree with WHO guidelines which report a 4 log reduction of coronavirus for 56°C (133°F) with 15‐minute exposures 14 and is consistent with information for killing other infectious agents. 15\nHowever, for temperatures in the range 50‐55°C (122‐131°F) we recommend 20 minutes or longer of exposure. At these levels, we expect the viral concentration to be lowered by log 5‐7, near or below the detectable limit.
