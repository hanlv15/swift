Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: San José del Guaviare Jorge E.

Working under the influence of these symptoms significantly impairs work productivity and leads to occupational accidents and errors. This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions.

The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media.\nA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1. Sleep disorders, particularly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), affect a significant number of healthcare workers (HCWs). These sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, daytime drowsiness, and sleep deprivation, which can impair work productivity, lead to occupational accidents and errors, and negatively impact patient care. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA, and 40.9% of HCWs reported at least one type of sleep disorder.\n2. A study published in 2021 found that health care workers with poor sleep were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression, 50% more likely to report psychological distress, and 70% more likely to report anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened sleep patterns and mental health issues among HCWs due to increased stress and workload.\n3. Insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reductions in alertness and vigilance, a slowing of reaction time, and impairments in maintaining focus. These effects can have severe consequences in patient care.\n4. Health care workers face significant work-related stress, which can negatively impact sleep quantity and quality. A 2016 review of multiple studies on sleep deprivation among nurses found that 55% work over 40 hours a week and 30%-70% report getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night.\n5. A study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that nearly all frontline HCWs reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim \"Sleep Troubles Hit Health Care Workers\" is TRUE. The detailed information from various sources highlights the significant sleep disorders and sleep disturbances among healthcare workers, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sleep issues can negatively impact work productivity, patient care, and mental health, emphasizing the need for sleep interventions and support for frontline healthcare workers.", "response": "TRUE."}

Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) continues to hit-hard on many countries across the world. Uganda reported its first case of COVID-19 on the March 21, 2020 (Coronavirus Disease, 2020).\nIn addition to the truck drivers, two cases of local transmission have been reported among Uganda Police Force officers, which may indicate an on-going community transmission of COVID-19. ... Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The confirmed case was a 36-year-old male who had travelled to Dubai on 17 March 2020 for a business trip. On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020–February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18–29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1). To assess more recent national trends, as well as state-specific trends, CDC used HPS data (4) to assess trends in reported anxiety and depression among U.S. adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) during August 19, 2020–June 7, 2021 (1).\nThe increased frequency of reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in this study indicates that mental health services and resources, including telehealth behavioral services, are critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19. National COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19.\nNational COVID-19 trends demonstrate that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by high COVID-19 incidence, which also suggests that these populations might be more vulnerable to the psychological consequences of COVID-19. The mental health impact of COVID-19 also might have community-specific effects when morbidity and mortality rates are increasing as a result of COVID-19. Fluctuations in symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic highlight the importance of real-time monitoring of mental health symptoms.\nFifth, the decrease in the frequency of symptoms observed through June 2021 occurred before the recent surge in COVID-19 cases involving the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; that decreasing trend might have slowed or reversed since June. Finally, these data are based on self-report and are subject to recall and social desirability biases.

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)).

This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is “a gross misinterpretation” of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nThat specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says.\nThe 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation most likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.\nEven someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.

What international law says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and “are particularly protective of civilian hospitals”, according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.\nArticle 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including “intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected”.\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are “military objectives”. Philip-Gay said that “if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used”, the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.\nOne: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque – those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-02\nTitle: What are the laws of war when a hospital is a war zone? | The Hill\nContent:\nAll wars are an effrontery to health, and the Israel-Hamas war is no exception. Caring for the wounded is a necessary part of waging war and hospitals are protected from the consequence of hostilities. Additionally, all medical personnel are considered non-combatants.\nAccording to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals can never be a military target. That hospitals should not be a military target seems uncontroversial, but a deeper question remains: when is a building a hospital and when is it not?\nHumanitarian law is pragmatic, however, and has an answer when attacks are launched from places assumed to be protected. A building ceases to be a hospital when it is used as a base to launch rockets. Under these circumstances, a building is transformed from “hospital” to “legitimate military target.” The distinctive emblem designating non-combatant status is the red cross, the reverse colors of the Swiss flag; launching only one rocket from the hospital parking lot is enough to change the meaning of a red cross on that building from “hospital” to “bullseye.”\nIf a decision is made to attack a hospital, international humanitarian law requires advanced warning to that hospital. If the hospital fails to heed the warning, the subsequent attack on that hospital must adhere to the principles of precaution and proportionality.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: Can Hospitals Be Military Targets? What International Law Says ...\nContent:\nThe Geneva Conventions, adopted in the aftermath of World War II, form the core of international humanitarian law and \"are particularly protective of civilian hospitals\", according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon-3 university in southeast France. \"It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone.\nArticle 8 of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including \"intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected\".\nBut it makes an exception if the targets are \"military objectives\".

But \"the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians\", she said. Even if the hospital is used for \"acts harmful to the enemy\", Philip-Gay said, the other party \"does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it\", citing the need under international law for the response to be \"proportionate\".\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-11-16\nTitle: The protection of hospitals during armed conflicts: What the law ...\nContent:\nAccording to international humanitarian law (IHL), health establishments and units, including hospitals, should not be attacked. This protection extends to the wounded and sick as well as to medical staff and means of transport. The rule has few exceptions.\nThe protection provided to the wounded and sick would have little meaning if medical personnel, medical units and establishments (such as hospitals), and medical means of transport were subject to attack. Therefore, IHL extends specific protections to them; parties to a conflict must respect them while they are performing an exclusively medical function, and must not unduly interfere with their work so as to allow them to treat the wounded and sick.\nSpecific protection of medical establishments and units (including hospitals) is the general rule under IHL. Therefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\".\nTherefore, specific protection to which hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used by a party to the conflict to commit, outside their humanitarian functions, an \"act harmful to the enemy\". In case of doubt as to whether medical units of establishments are used to commit an \"act harmful to the enemy\", they should be presumed not to be so used.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 (no publication date): Customary IHL states that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law unless they lose their protective status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. If there is doubt about a hospital's status, it should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 2 (published 2023-11-17): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, if there is doubt, the hospital should be presumed to be protected.\n\nInformation 3 (published 2023-11-02): Hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be a military target. However, if a hospital is used to launch rockets, it becomes a legitimate military target. Advanced warning must be given before attacking a hospital, and the attack must follow the principles of precaution and proportionality.\n\nInformation 4 (published 2023-11-16): The Geneva Conventions protect hospitals, and attacking them is a war crime under the Rome Statute, except if they are military objectives. If a hospital is used for harmful acts against the enemy, it can lose its protected status and become a legitimate target. However, the other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians, and the response must be proportionate.\n\nInformation 5 (published 2023-11-16): According to International Humanitarian Law, hospitals should not be attacked, and medical personnel, medical units, and means of transport should be respected. The protection of hospitals can only cease if they are used for harmful acts against the enemy, and in case of doubt, hospitals should be presumed not to be used for such acts.\n\nClaim Summary: An official decree was taken by the government stating that the military will have to help in hospitals.\n\nGiven the information available, the claim does not provide enough context to determine if it is true or false. However, the information provided does support the idea that hospitals are protected under International Humanitarian Law and cannot be attacked unless they lose their protected status by being used for harmful acts against the enemy. Therefore, if the government decree states that the military will be helping in hospitals, it is likely that the hospitals have not lost their protected status and are still considered protected civilian facilities.", "response": "FALSE."}

The researchers discovered that in the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial that tested the efficacy of the antiviral remdesivir, Black Americans made up about 20% of the total patient population.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. research shows lack of diversity in clinical trials\nContent:\nHere’s what the committee thinks equitable research looks like: a clinical trial population that matches the demographics of the disease being studied.

While diversity has become an increasingly important priority in clinical research, racial and ethnic minority populations continue to be left out.\nFDA urges creation of racial, ethnic recruitment plans for clinical trials · The current lack of representation has real consequences: not only does it contribute to the failure of studies to complete, but in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the absence of pregnant people in trials led to vaccine hesitancy in this population.

The committee has a slate of recommendations for federal agencies, journal editors, Congress, clinical trial sponsors, academic centers, healthcare systems and more. They include a new Department of Health and Human Services task force to examine equity in research and ensure data collection; FDA requirements for recruitment plans when submitting an investigational new drug application or investigational new device exemption application; standardized requirements for the submission of demographic data to the ClinicalTrials.gov database; representation data requirements for journal publications; coverage guidelines from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that consider representativeness; a congressional requirement for the FDA to enforce accountability and incentive structures; expedited CMS coverage decisions for drugs and devices that were tested in\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Diversity in Our Clinical Trials | Pfizer\nContent:\nThere are barriers that exist to clinical trial participation, including geographic access, language barriers, limited awareness and communication of research options, cost or insurance concerns, and lack of trust in the medical community and drug development process due to discrimination and mistreatment of ethnically diverse groups in clinical research in the past. In fact, Black Americans account for roughly 13% of the U.S. population but make up only 5% of clinical trial participants. Hispanic and Latino participants account for roughly 19% of the population in the U.S. but make up only 1% of clinical trial participants.* Historic mistreatment and human rights violations in research throughout the world have resulted in changes in the law to ensure that clinical trials are conducted ethically and participants come first.\nAt Pfizer, we are committed to creating change for the better by doing our part to make a more inclusive future for clinical research and by building trusted relationships within diverse communities. Ensuring diversity in clinical trials is a matter of equity.\nThe more diverse a group of clinical trial participants is, the more we can learn about the safety and efficacy of a potential medicine or vaccine for people now and in the future. ... Historically, some communities have been underrepresented as participants in clinical research.\nTo gain an understanding on the disparity of minority representation in our own studies, we published a landmark, 10-year retrospective analysis (taking data from 2011–2020) of the ethnic, racial, age, and gender diversity in our clinical trials. This study serves as an important industry benchmark and baseline from which to measure our future progress in advancing health equity.

Ensuring racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials for development of COVID-19 vaccines is particularly important since COVID-19 has taken a heavy disproportionate toll on people of color, and people of color, particularly Black adults, historically have had lower vaccination rates and express more concerns about getting a COVID-19 vaccine compared to their White counterparts.\nOther access challenges, such as prohibitive distance to trial sites for people with limited transportation options, limited flexibility in work and caregiving schedules, and lack of access to technology for monitoring that may be required as part of the trial also may increase barriers to participation among people of color. Beyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color.\nBeyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color. Further, enrollment efforts may not effectively reach people of color if they are not culturally appropriate and do not address differences in language and health literacy.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n1. A study published in February 2021 by a team of scientific experts from various institutions highlights the lack of diversity in vaccine trials over the past decade. The study emphasizes the need for better representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, as enrollment may impact vaccination rates among minorities. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have set up a committee to improve the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in clinical trials.\n2. An article published on August 17, 2020, discusses the lack of diversity in COVID-19 clinical trials. Researchers have found that minority populations are underrepresented in remdesivir clinical trials. Federal laws instructing the inclusion of minorities in government-sponsored research have not been effectively implemented.\n3. A report highlights the lack of representation in clinical trials conducted in the U.S. The committee recommends creating racial and ethnic recruitment plans for clinical trials, standardized requirements for the submission of demographic data, and representation data requirements for journal publications.\n4. Pfizer acknowledges the barriers to clinical trial participation, including geographic access, language barriers, limited awareness, cost or insurance concerns, and lack of trust in the medical community. Pfizer is committed to creating change for the better by building trusted relationships within diverse communities and ensuring diversity in clinical trials.\n5.

This claim is false based on the available information and general knowledge.\n\nFirst, the information provided in Information 1 explicitly contradicts the claim, stating that COVID-19 is not caused by sarin gas. Information 2 further supports this by discussing the emergence, virology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nSecond, the claim is inconsistent with general knowledge about coronaviruses and sarin gas.

There have been increasing calls for research to better capture and report on socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes alongside race/ethnicity to identify populations that may experience a disproportionate burden of risk and/or ability to benefit from pandemic mitigation strategies.(10,13) We observed significant racial/ethnic disparities in ability to social distance as a measure of COVID exposure, susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and access to healthcare in our national cohort.\nMitigation strategies and messaging should intensify focus on Hispanic and Black NH individuals with conditions that increase risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and incorporate targeted, culturally appropriate communication. As with all observational studies, confounding of the exposure-outcome relationship is a concern, and we did not address the possibility of joint effects of the SEP indices.\nWe examined the relationship between each SEP index with COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or seroconversion), and we assessed race/ethnicity as a potential effect measure modifier (EMM) of the relationship between each SEP index and COVID-19 outcome.\nSecond, as the measure of COVID-19 susceptibility, we included conditions or behaviors that CDC has identified as increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications given SARS-CoV-2 infection: aged 60 years or older, daily smoking, and underlying chronic conditions (chronic lung disease, current asthma, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, immunocompromised condition, or HIV positive).

Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), named by the International Classification Committee of viruses, has brought new health threats and challenges to the world. In March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by WHO.\nOn the contrary, the position statement in EASL-ESCMID recommended [43] that the dose of immunosuppressant drugs can be adjusted according to antiviral treatment regimens, because it is likely that the drugs in both regimens will interact with each other. During the pandemic, for patients undergoing liver transplantation, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected to prevent infection. In conclusion, in COVID-19 disease, elevated liver enzymes are usually mild and generally recover without treatment.\n(5) In patients with autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplantation, patients with elevated COVID-19 activity and liver biochemical reactions should not be considered to have sudden onset of disease or acute cellular rejection without biopsy confirmation. (6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed.\n(6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed. Non-emergency patients may postpone liver ultrasonography or liver biopsy. Strict treatment indications should be followed when immunosuppressive agents are initiated in patients with liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis [AIH] or graft rejection.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide details about the impact of COVID-19 on liver disease and liver transplant patients, as well as recommendations for their care. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has released a \"living\" document that offers clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with liver disease and the healthcare providers who treat them (Information 1 and 3). The document advises healthcare providers to consider high-risk waitlisted patients and reduce organ recovery due to COVID-19 related limitations (Information 3). Emerging data suggest that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 (Information 3).\n\nInformation 4 discusses monoclonal antibodies used for prevention and treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients and those with suboptimal vaccination response. The presence of new viral variants has made it difficult to predict the efficacy of these therapies for emerging dominant strains.\n\nInformation 5 describes the latest developments regarding coronavirus and the pathogenesis of liver injury, the prone population and clinical characteristics of these patients, and providing some suggestions for clinical treatment.\n\nThe claim in question is a commentary on treating liver disease during COVID-19 with new recommendations. Given the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the claim is about the AASLD's \"living\" document, which offers clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with liver disease. Therefore, the claim is likely to be true, and it is about Information 1, 3, and the content of the AASLD's \"living\" document.", "response": "TRUE."}

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

Keeping it in your car during hot weather, exposing it to sun causing magnification of light through the bottle,” WLFD wrote.\nOn May 22, NFPA published another video to debunk alcohol-based hand sanitizer car fire claims. “Despite some information currently being released on social media and in the news, the short answer is no,” Verzoni wrote. “From a fire safety standpoint, it is not unsafe to leave hand sanitizer inside a hot vehicle.”\nGreg Boyce, Florida Gulf Coast University department of chemistry and physics associate professor, said hand sanitizer should not be kept in a car for more than a few hours during a March 26 interview with ABC. “If you are running errands and want to keep it in the car, that’s fine,” Boyce said. “But you shouldn’t be leaving it in the car indefinitely.” · Cathy Pagendarm, Quanta Services Inc. and WLFD have not responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment. We rate the claim that alcohol-based hand sanitizer stored in hot cars can ignite FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 22, 2020, from an article on Car and Driver, discusses a warning issued by the fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, about the potential for alcohol-based hand sanitizer bottles to explode in cars. The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather. The article explains that while the threat from hand sanitizer exploding might be overstated, there is still a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 24, 2020, from an article on WFTV, shares a statement from a fire expert who explains that a car's internal temperature would need to reach 572 degrees to cause hand sanitizer to explode. The expert also recommends keeping hand sanitizer with you and allowing it to dry for about a minute after applying it.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 2, 2020, from an article on USA TODAY, states that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable but can only ignite if a flame is introduced. Experts say that although leaving small amounts of ABHS in your car does not pose a significant fire risk, it should not be kept in vehicles because high temperatures can lower its disinfectant ability.\n\nClaim Accuracy:\n\nConsidering the information provided, the claim that a car blew up in Belém, Brazil, because the driver cleaned his key with alcohol-based hand sanitizer is likely false. The information presented in the sources indicates that while alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable, it requires a flame source to ignite, and the possibility of it exploding in a car due to heat or sunlight is minimal. Additionally, none of the sources mention any incidents of cars exploding due to hand sanitizer use.", "response": "FALSE."}

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I. Estimates of the number of deaths from the pandemic range from 21 million to 50 million worldwide.

There are many human coronaviruses, and these products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold.\nIn terms of the disinfectants, testing is required for manufacturers to make claims about their products.

Similarly, some Lysol products — including disinfectant and multi-purpose sprays and wipes— have shown effectiveness against similar viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces, per a statement from Lysol.

Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.

County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years.

Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths.

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective. Figures from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland show that people admitted with covid-19 after 1 September were about 10 per cent less likely to die than those admitted before then. 16% Estimated coronavirus infection fatality rate for people over 90\nThe best way to work out how many people have been infected is to test the blood of thousands of people to see how many have antibodies to the coronavirus, and then extrapolate the results to entire countries. But antibody surveys can produce a misleading picture because of false positive and false negative results. The number of confirmed cases that countries report can't be used to calculate the infection fatality rate because most cases aren't detected – not everyone has symptoms, and not all who do get tested.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in Scientific American, explains that the mortality burden of COVID-19 is growing in certain groups of people nearly three years into the pandemic.\n\nInformation 2, published on January 6, 2023, states that the number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. passed one million in 2022.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years.\nThe estimates presented may be an early indication of excess mortality related to COVID-19, but should be interpreted with caution, until confirmed by other data sources such as state or local health departments. It is possible that recent improvements in the timeliness of data could also contribute to the pattern where a jurisdiction exhibits recent increases with the weighted data, but not the unweighted. Conversely, recent increases may be missed in jurisdictions with historically low levels of completeness (e.g., Connecticut, North Carolina) either due to the lack of provisional data or insufficient weighting to address incomplete data.\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.\nAs some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted. Additionally, deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were also estimated.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-02-11\nTitle: COVID-19 Data Review: Update on COVID-19–Related Mortality | CDC\nContent:\nAs of November 9, 2022, 1,070,947 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the United States.1 In the first two years of the pandemic, COVID-19 was identified as the third leading cause of death in the United States, trailing only heart disease and cancer.2, 3 Provisional mortality data indicate that, despite a lower number of COVID-19–related deaths reported to date in 2022, COVID-19 remains the third leading cause of death in the United States.3 · Several factors have led to changing patterns of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality over the course of the pandemic, including the introduction and widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, high population prevalence of infection-induced immunity, increased availability of effective COVID-19 outpatient treatment, and changes in the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.\nFrom January to April 2022, age-standardized COVID-19–related mortality rates decreased for all racial and ethnic groups. The risk of in-hospital death for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 declined among all adult age groups.

The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.

Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak. There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.", "response": "FALSE."}

Identifying, explaining and addressing the motivations that make rule breakers tick is necessary to end the crisis for everyone.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic lashes countries in a second (and in some cases, third) wave of infections, patience and solidarity are giving way to frustration and blame. Officials in the United States and Germany say the latest upsurge in infections in their countries is a consequence of a selfish minority that is ignoring basic social distancing rules, while Berlin’s tourism authority has launched a colorful campaign—complete with an old lady and an offensive finger—chastising visitors who refuse to wear masks.\nFor instance, we found that fear of financial loss caused by virus containment strategies—rather than health risks—was often a stronger motivator for abiding by or ignoring government rules.

This claim is in line with Information 2, which discusses the importance of understanding the motivations behind rule-breaking behavior.

However, Information 4 and 5 do not directly address the harm of crackdowns on rule breakers.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially supported. Crackdowns on COVID-19 rule breakers could be harmful if they do not address the underlying motivations of the individuals and fail to provide support. However, the claim does not consider the importance of enforcement and penalties in ensuring compliance with public health measures.\n\nReasonable evidence to support the claim includes research on the motivations behind rule-breaking behavior and the potential negative consequences of punitive measures.

(There were differences among the vaccines, with Moderna’s primary series of two shots showing the highest effectiveness of 62% one month after the series, and Sinovac’s demonstrating the lowest effectiveness at 32%.) After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. FACT: Vaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months. Still, that doesn’t mean the immune system has checked out of the fight.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: How long does immunity last after COVID-19 vaccination? | Gavi, ...\nContent:\nBecause of this, it has been too soon to say exactly how long these COVID-19 vaccines will protect people for, and whether we might need a booster shot further down the line. However, now the first evidence is emerging · On 1 April, Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time. The studies did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-09-27, explains how vaccines work and debunks myths about COVID-19 vaccines. It states that vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection against the disease without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track movement and do not contain microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, or nanowire semiconductors.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2023-09-22, provides further details on how COVID-19 vaccines work. Protein subunit vaccines contain pieces of the virus that causes COVID-19, and an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to the spike protein. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, it will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect against COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-12-13, explains how COVID-19 immunity works at this point in the pandemic. Antibodies produced after an infection or vaccination wane after a few months. Immunization is the most effective way to launch antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, states that it is too soon to say exactly how long COVID-19 vaccines will protect people for, but there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity can last for up to eight months, and vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting.\n\nClaim: The immunity produced by the COVID-19 vaccine only works for six months.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is mostly false. Information 1, published after the claim, states that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines drops to 14% after six months. However, Information 5, with no publication date, states that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Information 4, published after the claim, also explains that immunity from vaccines wanes after a few months, but this does not mean the immune system has checked out of the fight. Therefore, while the effectiveness of the vaccine may drop after six months, immunity is not limited to six months.", "response": "FALSE."}

The isolation of this mystifying virus and phylogenetic examination demonstrated close similarity with SARS-CoV virus that appeared in year 2002-03 and hence refereed as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2” (SARS-CoV-2) [9]. As of now (May 31, 2020) almost 61,83,559 cases have been confirmed with COVID-19 with almost 3,71,364 fatalities around the world (in 212 countries) [10]. Till date no approved treatment is available for curing COVID-19, based on the drug repurposing and in-vitro inhibition strategy various drugs such as acyclovir, chloroquine, ganciclovir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ganciclovir and ritonavir are used to treat COVID-19, however none of the drug is approved by the FDA for the COVI\nRepurposing of the drug: There is no approved treatment as well as no approved drug is available for the COVID-19 till date [2,17]. Repositioning of the drug is the strategy that is applied for the treatment of COVID-19 based on in-vitro inhibition analysis and antiviral mechanism [2,3]. However, use of random drugs for COVID-19 treatment may develop resistance power of pathogen, may have lethal and detrimental side effects which restricts the direct use of anti-viral drugs and knock the door for designing of vaccine (as a better and safer option) [3,17].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccinations - Our World in Data\nContent:\nOn each chart of this page, therefore we choose a default selection of countries based on a mix of criteria: mainly total population, but also the number of doses administered and share of the population vaccinated.

Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24].

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false. The information indicates that dryers are not effective at killing all germs and viruses, and there is no mention of using a hairdryer for sterilization purposes. Additionally, the information about hairdryer usage is related to styling hair, not sterilization. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

The injured teacher was kept in the principal’s office with a wad of paper towels on her head for almost half an hour until most of the kids had been dropped off for the day and the buses had arrived.\nBack in my teaching days, during the year I worked in an elementary school, a teacher’s aide in the classroom for the most severely disabled kids in the entire district passed out. An ambulance was called immediately, and the principal got on the loudspeaker to tell everyone to stay in their classrooms/out of the hallways. I’m sure some of the students were upset, but I’m glad that the people in charge decided to, you know, prioritize the unconscious woman in the middle of the floor.\nI’m wondering if I could get your take on a situation that happened at the elementary school where I teach back in September. It’s been a few months since it happened, but it’s still on everyone’s minds. On the first day of school, one of my fellow teachers tripped and fell backwards down the concrete steps leading up to the entrance of the school as she was arriving that morning.\nWe’re all very concerned that she chose to put the appearances of the school ahead of the safety of an injured teacher. I know what she was probably thinking — “these parents won’t leave me alone if they see an ambulance here, they’ll think the school isn’t safe for their children,” etc.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: When do you need to call an ambulance for a high fever? - Quora\nContent:\nAnswer (1 of 9): A high <strong>fever</strong> on its own can be a symptom of absolutely anything, from trivial viral infections up to and including bacterial meningitis.

It suggests that parents should be called if a child has a fever and seems lethargic, severe abdominal pain, or is bleeding excessively. A red flag system is often used to alert reception of a serious incident.\n\nInformation 2 explains that fevers are the body's way of fighting infections, often raising the body temperature above normal.\n\nInformation 3 suggests calling an ambulance if a student passes out, regardless of their age.\n\nInformation 4 describes two situations where a principal decided not to call an ambulance for injured teachers, prioritizing the school's appearance over the safety and well-being of the teachers.\n\nInformation 5 discusses when to call an ambulance for a high fever, stating that a high fever can be a symptom of various conditions, and other symptoms should be considered.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim states that starting from September, teachers will have to call an ambulance if a student has a fever at school. However, the information provided does not support this claim directly.\n\nInformation 1, 2, and 5 suggest that fevers can be a symptom of various conditions, and it is essential to consider other symptoms when deciding whether to call an ambulance.

Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.\nNICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway. However, particularly in countries where the pandemic situation continues to worsen (and will continue to do so during the winter months before the effects of vaccinations become perceptible), additional evidence could come in just too late.\nExperts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19. NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.\nThe fascination with vitamin D supplementation began with the discovery in the early 1920s that vitamin D prevented rickets and was further driven by the recognition of other potential roles of vitamin D in non-skeletal outcomes, including immune function, cardiovascular health, and cancer. However, whereas data on the function of vitamin D in bone growth and maintenance is clear-cut and has informed practical clinical guidelines and public health policies over the years, evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in other health and disease processes, in particular in acute respiratory tract infection, remains patchy.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D may not protect against COVID-19, as previously ...\nContent:\nBut there is still not enough evidence that taking supplements can prevent or treat COVID-19 in the general population. “Most vitamin D studies are very difficult to interpret since they cannot adjust for the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as older age or having chronic diseases, which are also predictors of low vitamin D,” says co-author Guillaume Butler-Laporte, a physician and a fellow under the supervision of Professor Brent Richards at McGill University.\nWhile previous research early in the pandemic suggested that vitamin D cuts the risk of contracting COVID-19, a new study from McGill University finds there is no genetic evidence that the vitamin works as a protective measure against the coronavirus. \"Vitamin D supplementation as a public health measure to improve outcomes is not supported by this study. Most importantly, our results suggest that investment in other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be prioritized for COVID-19 randomized clinical trials,\" say the authors.\nFuture studies are needed to explore the relationship with vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes in other populations, say the researchers. “In the past Mendelian randomization has consistently predicted results of large, expensive, and timely vitamin D trials. Here, this method does not show clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation would have a large effect on COVID-19 outcomes,\" says Butler-Laporte, who is a microbiologist and an expert in infectious diseases.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-01-26\nTitle: Can vitamin D protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?\nContent:\nFind out what the research says about <strong>vitamin</strong> <strong>D</strong> and coronavirus disease 2019 (<strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong>).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D | COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines\nContent:\nVitamin D deficiency (defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤20 ng/mL) is common in the United States, particularly among people who identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black.2 These groups are overrepresented among cases of COVID-19 in the United States.3 Vitamin D deficiency is also more common in older patients and patients with obesity and hypertension; these factors have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.4 High levels of vitamin D may cause hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis.5 · There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\nThe studies summarized below are those that have had the greatest impact on the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s recommendations.  · Although multiple observational cohort studies suggest that people with low vitamin D levels are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes after infection (e.g., higher mortality), clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation provides protection against infection or improves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.6,7\nAlthough multiple observational cohort studies suggest that people with low vitamin D levels are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes after infection (e.g., higher mortality), clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation provides protection against infection or improves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.6,7  · In a double-blind trial conducted at 4 hospitals in Mexico, frontline health care workers were randomized to receive vitamin D3 4,000 IU or placebo for 30 days.8 Participants were enrolled before COVID-19 vaccines became available.\nRead information about vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 5 are sources that discuss the potential role of vitamin D in preventing or treating COVID-19. These sources mention that while vitamin D has been shown to have immune-boosting effects, there is no conclusive evidence to support its use as a treatment or preventative measure for COVID-19. Information 1 and 2 specifically mention that there is a lack of specific evidence linking vitamin D supplementation with improvement among people with COVID-19.

Even after four days of care, the fever persisted and the family from Surat, Gujarat, took the infant to his paediatrician. Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors.

India which is the second-largest population in the world having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on18th May 2020, and as of 11th of July crossed 8.5 lakhs.\nCOVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.\nThe tourism sector also expected to have 70% job losses [54]. Likewise, India has an economy where a large section of people depends on the daily wages e.g. autorickshaw drivers, carpenters, delivery boys, domestic laborers, scrap or waste collectors, tea girls, vegetable vendors, and waiters. Unaware of the end to this pandemic COVID-19 and restricted lockdown scenarios, returning to its pre-lockdown stage will take time.

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ...

It is useful to first visualize what different stable matchings look like (refer to the graphs on the right). Consider two different stable matchings, A and B.\nThe rural hospitals theorem answers this question negatively assuming all preferences are strict (i.e., no doctor is indifferent between two hospitals and no hospital is indifferent between two doctors). The theorem has two parts:\nThe rural hospitals theorem (RHT) is a fundamental theorem in the theory of stable matching. It considers the problem of matching doctors to hospitals for residency, where each doctor is matched to a single hospital but each hospital has several positions for doctors.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Why Health Care Is Harder to Access in Rural America | U.S. GAO\nContent:\nMore than 60 million Americans—about one-fifth of the U.S. population—live in rural areas. On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents. But while they may require more medical attention and care, they also might have more limited access to health care.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 2, 2020, is an article discussing the challenges faced by rural hospitals in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic. These hospitals serve older, poorer, and sicker populations with fewer resources, including ICU beds, staffing options, and access to specialists. The unpredictable course of the pandemic and varying outbreak patterns in rural areas require hospitals to prepare for different scenarios.\n\nInformation 2 is not relevant to the claim, as it is an introduction to a public eye health education resource for the state of North Carolina.\n\nInformation 3, while not directly related to the claim, provides context on the differences between small rural hospitals and urban or larger rural hospitals. Small rural hospitals face financial challenges and often serve as the only healthcare access point for their communities.\n\nInformation 4, published on January 8, 2022, discusses the Rural Hospitals Theorem (RHT), which is a theorem in the theory of stable matching. The RHT has two parts, and Part 1 states that all stable matchings have the same set of matched hospitals and doctors. However, this information is not directly related to the claim.\n\nInformation 5, while undated, provides context on the challenges faced by rural residents in accessing healthcare. Rural residents are older and have worse health conditions on average, but they might have limited access to healthcare.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially supported. Rural hospitals are indeed facing challenges in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in Information 1.
