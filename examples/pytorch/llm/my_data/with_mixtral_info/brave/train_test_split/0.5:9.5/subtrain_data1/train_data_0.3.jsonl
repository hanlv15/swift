Davis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected.\nThe researchers focused on three groups of people: those who were not yet vaccinated and had gotten COVID-19, those who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and had not been infected, and people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers looked at a group of T cells called CD8 cells, or killer T cells, which destroy and remove infected cells during the latter part of an infection.\nMark Davis, a professor of immunology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection, and his team made the discovery when studying T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 72 people through the early months of 2021, as the first COVID-19 vaccines were becoming available.\nDavis was surprised to find that levels of CD8 cells were lower among people who had gotten vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19, compared to those who had been vaccinated and never infected. The results differ from changes in antibodies, which are the body’s first line of defense and help block viruses from infecting cells. Studies of COVID-19 patients show that antibody levels in people who have been vaccinated and infected tend to be slightly higher than levels of antibodies among those who have been vaccinated and never been infected—creating hybrid immunity.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nThese clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles. As a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued. In addition, the date of vaccination should be recorded in the medical record of patients. Several practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported.\nSeveral practical measures to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported. These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nIn addition, booster vaccines have been used, but their effectiveness against the highly mutated spike protein of Omicron strains is limited. Recently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.\nThe time elapsed since the last COVID-19 vaccination may need to be considered when invasive procedures are required. Several practical measures that can be implemented to prevent a decrease in immunity have been reported [16].

O’Looney also compares this alleged effect to chemotherapy, a treatment for cancer that can hinder immunity due to reducing white blood cells produced by the bone marrow (here and here). “So, they’ve had the jabs maybe six to eight months ago and it’s been eating away at their immune system – and now they’re struggling to fight off things like the common cold,” O’Looney says in the clip.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy T cells or weaken immune system ...\nContent:\nThe vaccine doesn’t destroy T cells or weaken the immune system.

THE FACTS: Articles that have amassed thousands of views across social media this week misrepresent a June study from Britain’s Francis Crick Institute, which looked at the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to produce neutralizing antibodies against viral variants.\nTHE FACTS: Articles that have amassed thousands of views across social media this week misrepresent a June study from Britain’s Francis Crick Institute, which looked at the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to produce neutralizing antibodies against viral variants. The articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.”\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others shows the vaccines boost the immune response. The mRNA vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, allowing it to generate an immune response, experts say.\nThe articles claim that the study shows the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine “destroys T cells” and “weakens the immune system.” · But that’s not at all what the research shows, according to the Francis Crick Institute’s Dr. David Bauer, one of the study’s authors. “Our work to date has not studied T cells at all,” Bauer told the AP in an email. “All research published to date shows that the Pfizer (and other) vaccines generate a strong, positive, protective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2.” · Outside experts confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t destroy or damage T cells.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-12-15, is a fact-check by Maldita.es stating that there has been no discovery that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-27, discusses a study that found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 and then vaccinated had lower levels of CD8 cells, a type of T cell, compared to those who were vaccinated and had not been infected. However, this study does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, discusses the adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them. It mentions that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of Covid-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals. However, this information does not support the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2021-12-13, is an article addressing false claims made by a British funeral director about Covid-19 vaccines weakening the immune system and stopping the body's ability to fight off the Omicron variant. The article explains that studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines boost the immune response and that the claim that the vaccine destroys T cells or weakens the immune system is false.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, is an article addressing false claims that a study from the Francis Crick Institute shows that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine \"destroys T cells\" and \"weakens the immune system.\" The article explains that the study did not examine T cells and that outside experts have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines do not destroy or damage T cells.\n\nIn summary, all of the provided information contradicts the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine permanently destroys the immune system.

The products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a bottle of disinfectant gel proves that the coronavirus existed before 2019 is false. The disinfectant gel in question was likely tested against a strain of the human coronavirus that causes the common cold, not the specific SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the current pandemic. Additionally, the US EPA's List N, published on 2020-03-13, includes disinfectants that are expected to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus when used according to the label directions, indicating that these products were not specifically tested against the virus before 2019.", "response": "FALSE."}

Earlier this year, scientists in various countries started examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19. The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.) Some media-watchers argued that Trump was deliberately distracting attention from weightier matters—including the firing of the State Department inspector general—and that the media shouldn’t let him. Others disagreed. ICYMI: Ronan Farrow, Ben Smith, and the problem of the superstar journalist · To understand Trump’s obsession with hydroxychloroquine, we need to back up a bit. Earlier this year, scientists in various countries started examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.\nOn Monday, President Trump casually told reporters that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he has repeatedly touted as effective against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The reporters seemed stunned. “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” Trump told them. The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.

Wash your hands frequently. Use soap and water if available, otherwise sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol will work. Wash for at least 20 seconds. Frequently clean and disinfect high touch surfaces like doorknobs, countertops and your cell phone. Avoid contact with those infected. We know, it’s not the most exciting bit of information -- but those are the only scientifically proven ways to help protect yourself against COVID-19.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has already issued warning letters to several essential oil companies warning them to stop saying their products can help against COVID-19. MYTH: Spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will stop you from getting coronavirus. FACT: Don’t do that. It’s not good for you. There are two different sanitizing methods out there. Hand sanitizers are meant for the body and are designed specifically to come into contact with human skin. They’re regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of that. Disinfectants, however, are meant to only be used on surfaces and on inanimate objects -- not the human body.\nFACT: There’s no evidence that this is true, although the World Health Organization does note that there is limited evidence that this can help you recover more quickly from the common cold (not COVID-19). Regular saline rinses have not yet been shown to prevent respiratory infections. MYTH: Antibiotics will help you against coronavirus. FACT: Antibiotics do not fight viral infections, they’re used to treat bacterial ones. Coronavirus is a virus, and thus not weak to antibiotics. MYTH: Getting a flu shot or a pneumonia vaccine will stop you from getting coronavirus.

Using a blow dryer to shoot hot air into your sinuses will kill the new coronavirus.\nThis is dangerously false. Studies underway involving chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not yet reached any conclusions and the FDA has not approved the drugs for use in treating COVID-19. If not taken in proper doses, these drugs can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.\nThough videos demonstrating and promoting this practice are circulating on the Internet, there is no evidence that the hot air generated by a dryer will kill the coronavirus. What’s more, the mucus found in our noses traps dust and other particles we inhale as part of our body’s disease defense system.

We have those protocols at UT Southwestern.

But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines.\nThe only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based.

During a public health emergency, when there is considerable scientific uncertainty, and political leaders act as frontline crises managers, it often becomes challenging to ensure evidenced-based recommendation over political interest [35]. For example, the statement, “Whether the vaccine comes or not, coronavirus will leave the country” made by a health minister is likely to confuse the public about the necessity of the vaccine [39]. It thus may affect vaccine acceptancy. The claim that vaccine against COVID-19 had already been invented may lead some to come to the conclusion that this pandemic was being used in an attempt to further vaccine sales [40, 41]. Such misinformation may lead to mistrust on pharmaceutical companies, healthcare agencies and emergency responders and impact overall vaccine acce\n43. ABC News.

This method overcomes the downsides of contact tracing apps as it protects the privacy and anonymity of individuals without needing active participation from device users.\n\nInformation 3 provides additional context about the underlying technologies and privacy concerns related to using mobile networks for tracking movements of people and relating them to the spread of COVID-19. It mentions a paper by Alsaeedy and Chong (2020) that explores performance indicators in a network to determine how crowded certain cells in a mobile network are and monitor their mobility with neighboring cells, to assess the risk of COVID-19 spread.\n\nGiven the information above, the claim is TRUE. The researchers at Colorado State University have developed a new, non-invasive strategy to identify areas at greatest risk for spreading COVID-19 by using data from existing cellular wireless networks to pinpoint potential hotspots for increased viral transmission. This strategy was published in the IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology in June 2020.\n\nReference:\nAlaa A. R. Alsaeedy, Edwin K. P. Chong.

No such announcement has been made. Complete with “BREAKING NEWS” graphics, viral Facebook text posts are spreading a falsehood about a government mandate requiring workplaces and schools to close in order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The posts are apparently intended to be part of a joke, though users have to click the link at the bottom to get the punchline. “The Government have announced measures that all workplaces with 10 employees or more are to have paid mandatory leave to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus starting from March 6, 2020,” the posts read.\nWe could find no evidence of the federal government or any state announcing any such requirements thus far. Some schools — including in Washington, Oregon and Rhode Island — were prompted to temporarily close due to the coronavirus, but not because of statewide mandates. And the U.S. Department of Education’s current interim guidance for schools does not call for mandatory two-week closings; it encourages schools to make decisions with local officials, noting that dismissals “may be recommended for 14 days, or possibly longer if advised by local health officials.”\nOthers switched out the vague “government” reference to make the claim specific to Michigan, Florida, Alabama and other states. Some commenters expressed an understanding of the joke, but the viral posts — amid a steady flow of coronavirus-related misinformation — nevertheless stand to mislead Facebook users as the U.S. grapples with the coronavirus.

Do most guys use a hairdryer? No. Most guys don't know why they would need one, nor are they comfortable using one. I hope that I can explain why a hair dryer is a great tool for your styling toolbox.\nUsing product to control your hair will only result in your hair falling to where it naturally wants to go. Your hair has typically been trained, through years of styling it, to fall in a certain way and the best way to get your hair to stop falling in that direction is to use a hair dryer.\nBy using a hair dryer, along with a brush, your setting your hair in place where you want it to go. When the hair is dry, regardless of which product you put in it, the hair will naturally want to fall back into the general shape of where you had blow dried it.\nIn addition, when using pomade or hair paste, the product functions best when the hair is dry. The products adhere more easily and evenly when there is no extra moisture. So using a hair dryer for a minute or two before styling can prevent that extra greasiness or uneven product application.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on May 8, 2020, explains that most dryers do not get hot enough to kill all germs and viruses, and offers tips for ensuring clothes are not carrying pathogens.\n* Information 2, with no specific publication date, describes Shared Equipment Services (SES), a laboratory equipment repair and service management program provided through the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n* Information 3, also with no specific publication date, provides a guide on how to clean a dryer in 30 minutes or less.\n* Information 4, with no specific publication date, includes a Quizlet study set with terms related to infection control, including some products requiring a certain number of hours of submersion to sterilize.\n* Information 5, published on January 26, 2015, explains the benefits of using a hairdryer for styling hair, including setting hair in place and improving the function of styling products.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that a message claims you need to sterilize products with a hairdryer is false. The information indicates that dryers are not effective at killing all germs and viruses, and there is no mention of using a hairdryer for sterilization purposes. Additionally, the information about hairdryer usage is related to styling hair, not sterilization. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.", "response": "FALSE."}

The proportion of the population that died was 0.29% in the most affected region, Lombardia, and 0.57% in the most affected province, Bergamo. Combining reported test positive rates from Italy with estimates of infection fatality rates from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we estimate the infection rate as 29% (95% confidence interval 15–52%) in Lombardy, and 72% (95% confidence interval 36–100%) in Bergamo.\nThis selection only makes a statistically significant difference for the region of Lazio and age groups below 30 years of age in few other regions, but otherwise does not affect our conclusions with any significance. Figure 1 shows a clear excess in mortality over the counterfactual predictions after the week ending on 22 February, when the first COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Italy.\nThis number is similar to the NYC IFR estimated from combining the age-dependent IFR from Italy data, and consistent with a lower bound of 0.49% IFR estimated independently of Italian data—by combining the NYC COVID-19 PFR of 0.286% as of October 2020, with the maximum TPR of 0.58% which was reached in April 2020.

An analysis of the sub-set of patients whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 (4) was performed with a sample of 1,453 deaths. This analysis showed that 96.5% of people who died were suffering from one or more pre-existing medical conditions, such as hypertension (69.9%), diabetes mellitus (31.8%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (28.0%) (5).\nThe most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contacting the infection) in deceased patients in Italy were: hypertension − 73.0%, old diabetes − 31.3%, ischemic heart disease − 27.8%, atrial fibrillation − 23.7%, chronic renal failure − 22.2%, active cancer in the last 5 years − 17.3%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) − 16.7% (26).

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics.

It further shows that cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.

In the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements.\nA key strain of the president’s narrative is that concerns about the coronavirus are being weaponized by bad-faith actors—a notion that has spawned a broad range of conspiracy theories. On Fox Business, Trish Regan accused Trump’s enemies of trying to “create mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off” that would harm his reelection prospects: “This is impeachment all over again,” she declared. Rush Limbaugh has mused that the president is the target of “virus terrorism.” And on Facebook and Twitter, a meme has begun circulating among Trump fans that darkly suggests a new disease is introduced every election year to influence politics.\nIn the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements. But in recent days, as U.S. health officials have raised growing concerns about the outbreak, Trump’s efforts to play down the pandemic have been amplified by the same multi-platform propaganda apparatus he’s relying on for reelection in November.\nScholars who study modern disinformation tactics have identified this approach as “censorship through noise.” (Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist, has described the strategy in blunter terms: “Flood the zone with shit.”) As I reported in my recent feature on the Trump campaign, the purpose of this sort of propaganda blizzard is not to inspire conviction in a certain set of facts; it’s to bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts, and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion. Read: The billion-dollar disinformation campaign to reelect the president · Spend some time wading through the coronavirus content that’s spreading through the MAGA ecosystem, and it’s easy to see the strategy at work. Trump supporters have been warned incessantly not to trust mainstream journalistic coverage of the issue.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-02, is an article from Snopes investigating whether President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a 'hoax'. The article explains that during a campaign rally in South Carolina on Feb 28, 2020, President Trump accused Democrats of politicizing the coronavirus outbreak and called it \"their new hoax\", but did not specifically call the virus itself a hoax.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, is a press release from the Trump Campaign, which includes quotes from Snopes, Lead Stories, and The Washington Post, all stating that President Trump did not call the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy\" is mostly false. While President Trump did use the term \"hoax\" in relation to the coronavirus, it was in the context of the Democrats' politicization of the virus, not the virus itself. This is supported by Information 1, which was published shortly after the event in question and provides a detailed analysis of President Trump's comments.\n\nInformation 3, a press release from the Trump Campaign, also supports this conclusion by quoting several reputable fact-checking organizations that have debunked the claim that President Trump called the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nTherefore, the claim that President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy is mostly false, as he specifically referred to the Democrats' politicization of the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.", "response": "FALSE."}

Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Moreover, more than half of the infected patients were young and asymptomatic. Virus transmission through asymptomatic patients is a major challenge to disease containment. Due to limited treatment options, preventive measures play major role in controlling the disease spread. Gargling with antiseptic formulation may have potential role in eliminating the virus in the throat.\nIn addition, salt water was not proven effective. Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies. An in vivo study among four COVID-19 positive patients suggested that povidone iodine gargling could reduce the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for at least three hours after gargling16.\nTherefore, there is a need to explore other commercial mouthwash formulations, to provide alternatives for the healthcare workers and the public to prevent COVID-19.

September 27, 2021.\n“This is just an anecdote, but I felt that gargling helped relieve my congestion and ability to breathe, which in turn improved my sleep.” · For the research, 58 individuals between ages 18 and 65 who tested positive for COVID-19 between 2020 and 2022 were selected to undergo either a low- or a high-dose saline regimen for five minutes, four times a day, over the course of 14 days.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Salt Water Gargle Vs. COVID-19: Researchers Launch Study to Lessen ...\nContent:\nSalt water gargle is a time-tested way to alleviate sore-throat pain. As a nasal lavage, it can help clear stuffy sinuses associated with colds and allergies. But, is it effective against the symptoms of COVID-19?\nAs Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the university's Usher Institute, said in the announcement, \"We are now moving to trial our salt water intervention in those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and hope it will prove to be a useful measure to reduce the impact and spread of the infection.” ... The trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-19, states that gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19 and has been debunked by the World Health Organization.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-11-07, announces a new study suggesting that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid, as both saline regimens were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, mentions that gargling with salt water was not proven effective against COVID-19, while gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body. The effectiveness of povidone-iodine against SARS-CoV-2 has been proven by various studies.\n\nInformation 4, with no publication date, states that rinsing your throat or nose with a salt water (saline) solution may help protect against severe COVID-19 infection, based on a new study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in 2021. The research found that the risk of hospitalization for people with the virus who regularly gargled with salt water or used it as a nasal rinse was significantly lower than for individuals in a reference group who did not follow a saline regimen.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, mentions a trial based on research published in the Journal of Global Health on March 29, 2020, entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” The study suggests that salt water gargle and nasal irrigation can help reduce symptoms by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, reducing swelling, breaking up mucus, and removing bacteria, fungi, and other irritants from the throat.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that gargling salt water can protect against COVID-19 by washing down the virus into the gut is false, as gargling salt water is not a recommended protective measure against COVID-19. However, recent studies suggest that gargling with salt water may help prevent Covid by reducing hospitalization rates in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Gargling salt water can help reduce symptoms by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, reducing swelling, breaking up mucus, and removing bacteria, fungi, and other irritants from the throat.\n\nReferences:\n\nInformation 1: <https://www.pesacheck.org/verification/false-gargling-salt-water-can-protect-against-covid-19/>\nInformation 2: <https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231107141009.htm>\nInformation 3: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7840650/>\nInformation 4: <https://www.medicalnewsbulletin.com/gargling-salt-water-could-lower-covid-19-hospitalization-risk/>\nInformation 5: <https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/11/211102141033.htm>", "response": "FALSE."}

The stockpile is running low. The Trump administration admits it. And no, this is not the states’ fault. But it’s not entirely clear what will happen when it’s emptied out.\nThe Strategic National Stockpile, like the nuclear arsenal, is something government officials hoped they would never need to use. Formed in 1999 as anxiety over Y2K mounted, this federal stockpile was designed to prevent an interruption to hospital supply chains, if all the computers ended up melting down on New Year’s Eve. That never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security.\nThat never happened, but because biological attacks were becoming a growing threat, the US government outfitted the stockpile in the interest of national security.

With an annual budget of about $600 million, the stockpile has maintained a large supply of personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, face shields, and surgical gowns, as well as medical equipment like the ventilators that hospitals so urgently need now to treat Covid-19 patients.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-06\nTitle: Depleted National Stockpile Contributed to COVID PPE Shortage: ‘You\nContent:\nWhen asked why the SNS didn’t receive appropriations for fully replacing the stockpile following H1N1, he says: “You’d really have to ask the Congress.” · As the documentary finds, sources both inside and outside the government had raised alarms, pre-COVID, about leaving the nation and its front-line health care workers without a PPE safety net.\nOver seven months of interviewing manufacturers and government officials, analyzing records and tracking key medical supplies, AP investigative reporters Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza, along with producer Peter Klein of the Global Reporting Centre and his team, found missed opportunities to prevent that failure stretching across several presidential administrations — including chances to invest in domestic manufacturing rather than relying on supplies made in China, as well as neglecting to substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. Intended as a fallback for covering medical-equipment needs in times of crises, the SNS is a set of government-run warehouses filled with medical supplies, such as ventilators and N95 respirator masks.

Ensuring racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials for development of COVID-19 vaccines is particularly important since COVID-19 has taken a heavy disproportionate toll on people of color, and people of color, particularly Black adults, historically have had lower vaccination rates and express more concerns about getting a COVID-19 vaccine compared to their White counterparts.\nOther access challenges, such as prohibitive distance to trial sites for people with limited transportation options, limited flexibility in work and caregiving schedules, and lack of access to technology for monitoring that may be required as part of the trial also may increase barriers to participation among people of color. Beyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation. For example, some research suggests that physicians are less likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color.\nBeyond these challenges, lack of awareness and information may limit participation.

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %). Countries with high values in spring 2020 recorded high excess mortality rates again in November 2020: Belgium (58.8 %), Italy (51.6 %), Austria (47.3 %), Malta (40.2 %), France (31.3 %) and Spain (24.4 %).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A ...\nContent:\nFrance’s deaths began around mid-March but the rate was slower than for Italy and Spain. France’s curve started to flatten in mid-May. The total growth of number of cases was slower for Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Austria (except for Germany, all relatively small populations, Belgium = 11.5 million; Netherlands = 17 million; Austria = 9 million). In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown. In Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.\nIn Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.

Indigenous nations' own codes and policies can be instituted to bolster this response, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US (Hiraldo et al., 2021).\nIn Australia, there are early indications of establishing regional data infrastructure so Indigenous nations can use data for development (National Agreement on Closing the Gap, 2020). One policy proposal to assist in the current COVID-19 environment for Indigenous communities to respond to COVID-19 is to invest in technological solutions such as a syndromic surveillance system for Indigenous community-controlled/based data systems where there are options to do so, and appropriate Indigenous data governance can be applied.\nData sharing involves both the release of tribal information as well as the sharing of tribal information that other governments hold, such as COVID-19 related data, with tribes. A number of states and the federal government have denied tribal rights to access data for decision-making (Tahir and Cancryn, 2020). There is a recognized need for other governments and organizations to establish data sharing agreements and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples (Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Indigenous Data Working Group, 2020; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).\nThe United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2020); World Health Organization (2020), and the Pan American Health Organization (del Pino and Camacho, 2020) call for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data (direct and indirect) and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples. In the US, there has been a call for the availability of data disaggregated by Indigenous nations and tribal affiliation themselves, with the caveat that this must be done within the context of Indigenous governance of those data, including data sharing agreements (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous Communities in Canada | The Health ...\nContent:\nPurpose: The purpose of this literature review was to explore the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. Methods: A literature review was conducted in June 2021. An infographic was created after a review of the literature.

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive. This indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\nThis indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets. However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%. Also read: What You Need to Know Before Trying to Make Sense of Sero-Survey Results · However, the researchers cautioned that four of the 15 districts in the survey (and out of 233 such districts in India, per the paper) with ‘zero cases’ didn’t have COVID-19 testing laboratories at the district headquarters and that samples collected in the area for tests had to be transported to state-headquarter hospitals.\n“The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas,” the researchers conclude. On July 10, PTI had reported that ICMR would conduct “a nationwide seroprevalence survey to determine the exposure of the novel coronavirus among the population … as a follow-up” to the one conducted in May-June.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is the official website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.\n\nInformation 2 is about a study conducted by ICMR that found that Indian food habits and ingredients, such as idli, rajma, zinc, fiber, and catechins present in tea, may have played an important role in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India. The study compared transcriptome profiles of COVID-19 patients from south India (Karnataka) and north India (Haryana) with those of Western populations.\n\nInformation 3 is about the importance of data sharing and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous nations' own codes and policies, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US. The information also highlights the need for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples.\n\nInformation 4 is a literature review of the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. The review found that many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. However, Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nInformation 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey. The survey found that 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive, indicating that India's COVID-19 epidemic had spread to rural parts despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\n\nClaim: As per ICMR study there’s been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions.

The plan is backed by many U.S. allies, including Germany, Japan and the European Commission and appealed to some members of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. However, Trump has criticized the WHO for what he calls its “China-centric” response to the pandemic, so the U.S. won’t partner with the organization.\nWhen countries opt out, that makes it more difficult to meet the goals of lower vaccine costs, better health outcomes and fewer COVID-19 deaths, the newspaper reported.

The collaboration is meant to speed up vaccine development, create doses for all countries and distribute them to people who face the highest risks for contracting COVID-19.\n* The U.S. withdrawal from the WHO and the decision not to join Covax means the U.S. is abdicating America’s global leadership in fighting pandemics.\n* This decision also likely eliminates the chance that the U.S. could secure vaccine doses from a pool of vaccine candidates across the world.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is true. The U.S. has announced on September 1, 2020, that it would not join Covax, an international coalition to find and distribute a Covid-19 vaccine worldwide, due to the group's association with the World Health Organization.

The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded.

In a new study in the Journal of Public Health, researchers from Queen Mary University of London and other U.K.-based institutions have expressed worry about these evident trends: “There is increasing concern over the higher rate of poor COVID-19 outcomes in BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] populations. Understanding potential drivers of this relationship is urgently needed to inform public health and research efforts.\nSpecialists express “increasing concern” over the fact that people of color and different ethnicities are at a higher risk of poor outcomes if they develop COVID-19. Preexisting diseases, vitamin D levels, or socioeconomic factors do not explain the disparities, they say.\nUntil researchers take an in-depth look at these and other possible underlying factors, outcome disparities for COVID-19 are bound to persist.

There have been increasing calls for research to better capture and report on socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes alongside race/ethnicity to identify populations that may experience a disproportionate burden of risk and/or ability to benefit from pandemic mitigation strategies.(10,13) We observed significant racial/ethnic disparities in ability to social distance as a measure of COVID exposure, susceptibility to COVID-19 complications and access to healthcare in our national cohort.\nMitigation strategies and messaging should intensify focus on Hispanic and Black NH individuals with conditions that increase risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and incorporate targeted, culturally appropriate communication. As with all observational studies, confounding of the exposure-outcome relationship is a concern, and we did not address the possibility of joint effects of the SEP indices.\nWe examined the relationship between each SEP index with COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or seroconversion), and we assessed race/ethnicity as a potential effect measure modifier (EMM) of the relationship between each SEP index and COVID-19 outcome.\nSecond, as the measure of COVID-19 susceptibility, we included conditions or behaviors that CDC has identified as increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications given SARS-CoV-2 infection: aged 60 years or older, daily smoking, and underlying chronic conditions (chronic lung disease, current asthma, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, immunocompromised condition, or HIV positive). Finally, as the measure of healthcare access, we included factors that affect medical care access: no primary care doctor, concerns about the costs of healthcare, concerns about seeing a doctor due to immigration status, or no health care coverage/insurance.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-08-17\nTitle: Racial Disparities in COVID-19: Key Findings from Available Data ...\nContent:\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing focus on its disproportionate impacts on people of color, particularly as availability of data to understand racial disparities has increased. This brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities.\nThis brief summarizes key findings from data and analyses examining COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing by race and ethnicity as of early August 2020 to provide increased insight into these disparities. Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus.

In April 2021, 82 Spanish scientific societies called for the government to continue to work towards herd immunity13.\nThis has been compounded by the confusion generated by the new option in Spain of combining different COVID-19 vaccines based on limited evidence. Even when current difficulties are eased, we can anticipate continued problems in meeting the needs of marginalised populations.

While there is a risk of increased childhood obesity due to sedentary behavior during stay-at-home orders, it is also possible that kids could be getting more physical activity at home. The key takeaway is that parents should make a concerted effort to maintain healthy eating habits and promote physical activity during the pandemic. The study mentioned in the information provides evidence that school closures could contribute to a rise in childhood obesity, but it does not necessarily follow that all kids will become obese as a result of stay-at-home orders.

The president began pinning the blame on testing as early as June 15, when in a tweet he said that because U.S. testing “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country … it shows more cases.” He called testing a “double edged sword” because it is “good to” have, but “[m]akes us look bad.”\nLater in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths. “Cases up only because of our big number testing,” he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. “Mortality rate way down!!!” · The same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, discusses the increasing coronavirus death toll in the United States, which was about 80,000 at the time. It also highlights that President Trump had been praising the overall number of tests conducted in the country, which had surpassed 8 million. However, Senator Lamar Alexander, who was set to chair a hearing on Tuesday, had stated that the testing conducted in the U.S. so far was not nearly enough.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 14, 2020, confirms that President Trump did say increased COVID-19 testing makes the U.S. look bad by increasing coronavirus case numbers.\n\nInformation 3, published on July 20, 2020, discusses President Trump's claim that testing creates more cases. The article argues that this claim is incorrect, based on a STAT analysis of testing data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not specified, but it appears to be a fact-checking article that discusses President Trump's claim that coronavirus testing makes the U.S. look bad. The article also mentions that Trump has called testing \"overrated\" and repeatedly said the high number of confirmed cases makes the U.S. look bad.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 25, 2020, discusses President Trump's claim that the surge in COVID-19 cases is only due to testing. The article argues that this claim is false and that data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing.\n\nBased on the available information, it is clear that President Trump did say that increased COVID-19 testing makes the U.S. look bad by increasing coronavirus case numbers (Claim is TRUE). However, the subsequent information published on July 20, 2020, and June 25, 2020, contradicts the president's claim that testing creates more cases or that the surge in cases is only due to testing. These claims are false, as increased testing is necessary to detect more cases, and the uptick in cases in many places outstrips the increase in testing.", "response": "TRUE."}

Special consideration could be given to high-risk waitlisted patients (ie, those with high Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores, risk of decompensation, or liver tumor progression). In addition, a reduction in organ recovery is expected because of COVID-19–related limitations on institutional resources and the evolving understanding of the risk of donor-derived disease transmission.\nEmerging data do suggest that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19. It is not clear whether the risk is specific to NAFLD or to coexisting metabolic risk factors such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are associated with COVID-19 severity. ... Taking these data into consideration, the AASLD document offers several recommendations.\nSpecial consideration could be given to high-risk waitlisted patients (ie, those with high Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores, risk of decompensation, or liver tumor progression). In addition, a reduction in organ recovery is expected because of COVID-19–related limitations on institutional resources and the evolving understanding of the risk of donor-derived disease transmission. In order to limit the number of patients in the clinic, the recommendation is that centers evaluate only those patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or severe disease that need immediate liver transplant listing.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 in patients with liver disease and liver transplant: ...\nContent:\nA variety of monoclonal antibodies have been used for both prevention and treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients and those with suboptimal vaccination response.

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), named by the International Classification Committee of viruses, has brought new health threats and challenges to the world. In March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by WHO.\nOn the contrary, the position statement in EASL-ESCMID recommended [43] that the dose of immunosuppressant drugs can be adjusted according to antiviral treatment regimens, because it is likely that the drugs in both regimens will interact with each other. During the pandemic, for patients undergoing liver transplantation, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected to prevent infection. In conclusion, in COVID-19 disease, elevated liver enzymes are usually mild and generally recover without treatment.\n(5) In patients with autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplantation, patients with elevated COVID-19 activity and liver biochemical reactions should not be considered to have sudden onset of disease or acute cellular rejection without biopsy confirmation. (6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed.\n(6) Patients with cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and post-transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing [42]. Other recommendations include that ongoing HBV and HCV antiviral therapy should be continued, but initiation of antiviral therapy in HCV patients may need to be delayed. Non-emergency patients may postpone liver ultrasonography or liver biopsy. Strict treatment indications should be followed when immunosuppressive agents are initiated in patients with liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis [AIH] or graft rejection.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide details about the impact of COVID-19 on liver disease and liver transplant patients, as well as recommendations for their care. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has released a \"living\" document that offers clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with liver disease and the healthcare providers who treat them (Information 1 and 3). The document advises healthcare providers to consider high-risk waitlisted patients and reduce organ recovery due to COVID-19 related limitations (Information 3). Emerging data suggest that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 (Information 3).\n\nInformation 4 discusses monoclonal antibodies used for prevention and treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients and those with suboptimal vaccination response.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nYes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: ... There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public's efforts to slow the spread, researchers' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-07-20\nTitle: More Genetic Clues to COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity | National ...\nContent:\nThis comprehensive search led to the identification of 13 regions of the human genome that appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection or severity. Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe. This comprehensive search led to the identification of 13 regions of the human genome that appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection or severity.\nThe new study, published in the journal Nature, includes data collected through the initiative as of January 2021, and represents nearly 50,000 COVID-19 patients and another 2 million uninfected controls [1]. In search of common gene variants that may influence who becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and how sick they will become, Ganna’s international team turned to genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Studies Reveal Key Clues about COVID-19 Immunity - Harvard Catalyst\nContent:\nCommunity Leaders and Mayo Clinic Researchers Develop Playbook for COVID-19 Health Equity, Future Pandemics. ... How does the immune system remember and recognize viral invaders it has encountered in the past? A trio of newly published studies of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated against the virus or both, are providing tantalizing new clues about the factors that influence the speed and magnitude of the immune system’s response to subsequent infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe three studies, published in Science Immunology and led by investigators at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, provide intriguing answers about how long COVID-19 immunity lasts and the nature of immune recall after infection, vaccination, or both.\nThe team analyzed the immune system’s response after infection, vaccination, and boosting by studying blood samples from individuals with different medical trajectories — those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but were not vaccinated, those who recovered from infection and were then vaccinated against COVID-19, or those who were never infected but had been vaccinated and boosted.\nIn addition, the researchers found evidence suggesting that memory of prior infection with common cold coronavirusesmild viruses that circulated before SARS-CoV-2—might be responsible for the robust, sustained immune response in a small subset of unvaccinated individuals who recover from COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity - PubMed\nContent:\nTherefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

The reasoning is flawed since it assumes that masks are mainly intended to protect the wearer from infection.\nClaim: CDC study finds overwhelming majority of people getting coronavirus wore masks”; CDC study shows that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers, therefore masks don’t work or are making us ill Claim Publisher: Jordan Davidson, The Federalist Date of Claim: 2020-10-14 Author of Article: Craig Jones Truthfulness: False ...

The claim asserts that the study found more mask wearers becoming infected as compared to those who never wear a mask. Specifically, it cites the figures from the table below, which reports that 3.9% of people who tested positive for COVID-19 reported never wearing a mask, while more than 80% reported wearing a mask either often or always.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-05-24\nTitle: Myth or Fact - Masks are effective against COVID-19 - Delaware's ...\nContent:\nFact is – masks are effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly. Here is a list of studies and sources to reference on the effectiveness of masking. Research shows that under most circumstances, mask wearing has no significant adverse health effects on the people who wear them (CDC, 2021).\nWearing a highly protective masks are important for certain higher-risk situations, or for some people at increased risk for severe disease (CDC, 2022). Community mask wearing is an effective non-medical way to reduce the spread of this infection. It is effective in preventing someone from spreading or getting the virus (JAMA Network). Face masks can be safely worn by all children 2 years of age and older, including the vast majority of children with underlying health conditions, with rare exception (AAP, 2022). ... As always, if you have questions about COVID-19 or the vaccines, you can always ask your health care provider.\nResearch shows that under most circumstances, mask wearing has no significant adverse health effects on the people who wear them (CDC, 2021). Masks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, which is especially important people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic. These people may feel well and may not know they are infectious (CDC, 2021).\nMasks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, which is especially important people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic. These people may feel well and may not know they are infectious (CDC, 2021). While all masks provide some level of protection, properly fitting masks provide the highest level of protection. Wearing a highly protective masks are important for certain higher-risk situations, or for some people at increased risk for severe disease (CDC, 2022).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2022-02-10\nTitle: Effectiveness of Face Mask or Respirator Use in Indoor ...\nContent:\nInterviewers recorded participants’ responses regarding COVID-19 vaccination status, sociodemographic characteristics, and history of exposure to anyone known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the 14 days before participants were tested. Participants enrolled during September 9–December 1, 2021, (534) were also asked to indicate the type of face covering typically worn (N95/KN95 respirator, surgical mask, or cloth mask) in indoor public settings.\nIn addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a comfortable, well-fitting face mask or respirator in indoor public settings protects against acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection; a respirator offers the best protection.\nAmong 534 participants who specified the type of face covering they typically used, wearing N95/KN95 respirators (aOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05–0.64) or surgical masks (aOR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13–0.90) was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator. These findings reinforce that in addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings reduces the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThese findings reinforce that in addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings reduces the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a respirator offers the highest level of personal protection against acquiring infection, although it is most important to wear a mask or respirator that is comfortable and can be used consistently.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-10-12, is a fact-check by Science Feedback stating that a CDC study published in September 2020 did not show that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, and that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The study mentioned in the claim is a case-control study, which is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention when it is widely used.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-03-15, is an article by ABC News discussing a review from the Cochrane Library that found masks don't work in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. However, experts told ABC News that the findings from the review have not been accurately represented and that evidence shows masks do help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-10-14, is a review by Health Feedback stating that scientific evidence supports the use of face masks as an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19. The claim that a CDC study shows that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers is false.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2022-05-24, is a fact sheet by Delaware's Division of Public Health stating that masks are effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly. Masks are primarily intended to stop people from spreading droplets that contain the virus, especially important for asymptomatic or presymptomatic people.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-02-10, is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim, published on 2020-10-12, states that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19.\n\nReasoning and evidence:\nThe claim is false, as multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Information 1, 3, and 4 all state that masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Information 5 is a study by the CDC that found wearing N95/KN95 respirators or surgical masks was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing any face mask or respirator. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a case-control study, which is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention when it is widely used.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that a CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don't work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19 is false. Multiple sources have stated that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.", "response": "FALSE."}

Research from the Imperial College London (ICL), in the United Kingdom, has predicted the likely effects on mortality of two different ways of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings, which are directly informing U.K. policy, suggest that in the U.K. and United States, a policy of suppressing the outbreak, rather than mitigating it, would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19: Mitigation or suppression? - PMC\nContent:\nNot only infectious disease experts, epidemiologists and ICU specialists are involved in this challenge, but also each individual in every community: Either as potential victim of COVID-19 or as an actual or potential care provider to infected persons in a bigger sense. Simply, the future of mankind is at stake! We are currently experiencing a unique situation in which science and scientists are getting all the attention of politicians, economists, clerics, media…etc. Scientists are in a race against time to combat a potentially fatal disease which healthcare systems even in the most developed world have to surrender to.\nPublished online 2020 Apr 21. doi: 10.1016/j.ajg.2020.04.010 ... Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology. Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nIt is quite evident that one of the reports which had great impact on decision making during the current crisis is the report of Neil Ferguson et al. on the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demands [1]. In their report, using a transmission model founded on an individual-based simulation model for pandemic influenza, the authors investigated the effects of 2 intervention strategies in a UK and a USA context: 1 – Mitigation strategy with the aim of slowing down transmission but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread (reproduction number R not necessarily <1) with protection of more vulnerable groups and reducing the peak healthcare demand, 2 – Suppression strategy in which epidemic spread is reversed to reproduction number (R) <1.\nIn the suppression group social distancing of all age groups, household quarantine and closing schools and universities are further interventions. In the mitigation strategy interventions have to be timely instituted (not too early) to give chance for herd immunity to develop.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Scientists say epidemic suppression is only viable option\nContent:\nIn the UK, this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK (previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated) and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity. “We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\nThe report by Imperial College’s COVID-19 Response Team - Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand – looked at two different strategies.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for ...\nContent:\nIn other words, we simulated a situation that from the second day of receiving confirmed case, only 5% of the overall population would be possible to contact the infectious ones. Then, the β2 = 0.05. The results were shown in the Fig 5. The results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time.\nThe results show that in all four cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 were successfully controlled, and had no peak time. There would be only more than 40 people that were infection and finally recovered at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. The overall period of COVID outbreak was less than 100 days.\nAmong a variety of factors leading to emergence and outbreaks of ID, the key issues are population density and human mobility where in these cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to at least 146 countries and territories on 6 continents in 2 months.\nAs implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. For COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [11] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results showed that under strong suppression of “lockdown Hubei”, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression ...\nContent:\nFor each scenario, we modeled the first suppression to have been initiated at the median threshold for the setting that has been observed to date (i.e., LICs and LMICs initiate earlier than UMICs and HICs, Table 1). We then selected the ICU incidence trigger within this range that minimizes COVID-19 mortality over 18 months and remains under our ICU threshold. We use a time window of 18 months as representative of the time scale over which pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., a vaccine) may become available, noting that this duration is highly uncertain (25).\nA full understanding of these will only be available retrospectively. Although our results illustrate the challenges that many countries will face in attempting to mitigate the impact of local COVID-19 epidemics, it is important to bear in mind that even moderate levels of changes in behavior can avert many infections and hence save millions of lives (30). Although suppression will always have the greatest impact on COVID-related morbidity and mortality, the intensity of interventions required needs to be balanced against the wider health risks that diverting all attention to a single disease could entail (31, 32).\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-20, supports the claim that COVID-19 suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time. The information is based on research from the Imperial College London, which has directly informed U.K. policy. The findings suggest that suppressing the outbreak rather than mitigating it would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die in the U.K. and the United States.\n\nInformation 2, while published later, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of the report by Neil Ferguson et al. on decision-making during the crisis, and the two strategies (mitigation and suppression) investigated in the report.\n\nInformation 3, like Information 1, supports the claim. It explains that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time, based on the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 and the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity.\n\nInformation 4, while discussing a different topic (a feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies), does not contradict the claim. It presents a scenario where the outbreak of COVID-19 is successfully controlled through suppression strategies.\n\nInformation 5, like Information 4, does not contradict the claim. It discusses the impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression, but does not argue against the claim that suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is likely true. Suppression is presented as the only viable strategy for minimizing the toll of the new coronavirus in Information 1, 3, and the claim. The other information does not contradict this claim.", "response": "TRUE."}

On 4 April, it was reported that the Delhi Police had found more than 500 foreign preachers \"hiding in 16–17 places\" in the city. According to health authorities, until 2 April, among 2000 positive cases in India nearly 400 cases can be epidemiologically traced to the Tablighi Jamaat cluster.\nOn 18 April, 4,291 confirmed cases of COVID-19 linked to this event by the Union Health Ministry represented a third of all the confirmed cases of India. Around 40,000 people, including Tablighi Jamaat attendees and their contacts, were quarantined across the country.\nSenior BJP leaders like Shivraj Singh Chouhan attributed Tablighi Jamaat congregation for a spike in cases of COVID-19 in the country, a claim which was disputed by experts from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College in Indore saying that they have no data to link the spread of the pandemic to the congregation. On the other hand, according to the first report in India tabled before Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan by the Department of Biotechnology in July 2020 on the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has found that a particular variant of the virus brought into the country mainly by travellers from Europe had become the most prominent across the country.\nSome social media users projected Muslims as the spreaders of COVID-19 in the light of Tablighi event in Delhi. As a result, Muslim vegetable vendors were barred from selling on the streets at many places by the locals in India, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, especially Dakshina Kannada. The Hindu Mahasabha national secretary and two BJP MLAs from Uttar Pradesh were arrested for their discriminatory remarks about Muslims and members of the Jamaat.\nA Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation that took place in Delhi's Nizamuddin Markaz Mosque in early March 2020 was a COVID-19 super-spreader event, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and at least 27 deaths linked to the event reported across the country.

No, that's not true: Lenard \"Lenny\" Wells had an illustrious career in law enforcement, serving decades with the Milwaukee Police Department in Wisconsin before later, after retirement, working as a crimininal justice instructor at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. As a result, his March 21, 2020, death from complications due to COVID-19 garnered attention -- and diferent headlines -- in various media outlets.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-10-13\nTitle: A man caught coronavirus twice—and it was worse the second time ...\nContent:\nThat makes him the fifth person to have officially caught the coronavirus twice, after cases recorded in Hong Kong, Belgium, Ecuador, and the Netherlands (and there will certainly be more cases we don’t know about).

The Facebook meme (Information 4) uses Wells's image to make a morbid joke but does not reflect the media's reporting.

Tens of thousands of people have been infected in Singapore, and as of May 8, more than 54,000 were infected in Africa. The coronavirus can spread in hot weather and has also spread in countries such as the UK where temperatures were cooler.\nShare this story: Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Linkedin\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Climate and the spread of COVID-19 | Scientific Reports\nContent:\nTo add evidence from a different perspective, we use global data to examine the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19 controlling for several important confounding factors. To this end, we regress the prevalence of COVID-19 (logarithmically transformed) at the country level against the latitude of a country.\nTo control for key confounders at the country-level, our analysis includes (1) data on air travel16 (to capture a possible way of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across countries but also the remoteness of a place, which might increase the need for air travel); (2) vehicle concentration17 and urbanization16 (to capture differences in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 within a country18); (3) COVID-19 testing intensity19,20 (to control for the vigor of a country’s COVID-19 response and for COVID-19 detection bias in cross-country comparisons21,22); (4) cell phone usage16 (to control for the speed at which information on behavior change for COVID-19 prevention travels within a country18,23); and (5) health expenditure (to capture differences in countries' commitment to population health); old-age dependency ratio (to capture cross-country differences in age structure and family compositions, which can affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2), and income16 (to control for differences in economi\nWHO’s warning that the virus spreads in all climates must still be taken seriously. At the time of revising this manuscript in January 2021, many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by an easier spread of COVID-19 in winter.\nIn sum, we show that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. Increasing temperatures and longer sunlight exposure during summer may boost the impact of public health policies and actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the threat of epidemic resurgence may increase during winter. However, our results do not indicate that the disease will vanish in summer, nor that countries located close to the equator will contain the disease without effective public health measures.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-24\nTitle: Will Heat Kill the COVID-19 Spread This Summer?\nContent:\nCan Coronavirus survive the heat? Could warm weather stop COVID-19 from circulating? Find out if the weather and heat can reduce or possibly end the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-31, is a fact-check by Poynter that debunks the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries. The claim originated from an anonymous letter stating that the virus can be fought off by eating chillies and ginger and can be destroyed at temperatures of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2018-01-25, explains that cold weather does not directly make people sick, and the misconception may come from the fact that people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other when it's cold, which can facilitate the spread of viruses.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-05-11, states that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive and spread in warm climates, citing Singapore and Africa as examples where the virus has spread despite warm temperatures.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a study that examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for several confounding factors. The study found that an increase in absolute latitude by 1° is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-24, discusses whether heat can kill the COVID-19 spread, but it does not provide a definitive answer.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that COVID-19 cannot spread in warm countries is false. The virus can survive and spread in warm climates, as evidenced by outbreaks in countries such as Singapore and Africa. Additionally, a study found that an increase in absolute latitude is associated with a higher number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that the virus may spread more easily in colder climates. Therefore, it is important to take WHO's warning that the virus spreads in all climates seriously and continue to follow public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.", "response": "FALSE."}

The most radical opposition figures, such as Mr Besigye, say that Mr Museveni has such a tight grip that an election alone will never unseat him. Instead, they see the polls as the catalyst for a political crisis, or even a popular uprising. The deployment of armed militia to enforce the covid-19 curfew looks to some like a dress rehearsal for suppressing post-election protests.\nThat is as much as the average Ugandan makes in a year. Some opposition leaders want Mr Museveni to declare a state of emergency and postpone elections. The old soldier is disinclined to do so.

The test can be performed in environments where the patient specimen is both collected and analyzed, such as doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, using an instrument about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage.\nThe performance of the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer was validated in a large study of 2,409 individuals, including those with and without symptoms. In the study, the test was shown to have 91.2% sensitivity (the percent of positive samples the test correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the percent of negative samples the test correctly identified).\nWhen the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer detects the presence of VOC markers of SARS-CoV-2, a presumptive (unconfirmed) positive test result is returned and should be confirmed with a molecular test. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as they do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions.\nInspectIR expects to be able to produce approximately 100 instruments per week, which can each be used to evaluate approximately 160 samples per day.

The device — a breath test that uses a biosensor — could become a tool for use in doctors’ offices to quickly diagnose people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\nScientists at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a breath test that quickly identifies those who are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

On March 13, one Facebook post with more than 150 shares explained the test, “Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no (COVID-19 caused) Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.”\nThe March 13 post claimed the breath test checked for fibrosis caused by COVID-19. The post read, “By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late.”\nSocial media posts claim holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19. We rate this claim as FALSE because it is not supported by our research.

So, how does the COVID-19 breath test stack up to current testing options?\ncollect your own sample at home or even perform the test yourself. So, how does the COVID-19 breath test stack up to current testing options? We’ve highlighted a few notable differences below.\nIf you’ve ever been tested for COVID-19, you know how unpleasant the experience can be. For many people, the 30 seconds of nasal swabbing can’t go by fast enough. But what if you could skip the swabs altogether? And what if the process could be as simple as breathing?\nThe FDA has authorized the first COVID-19 test that uses breath samples. It can be used by adults with or without symptoms of COVID-19. Instead of detecting the virus, the breath test looks for chemical compounds released by the body in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, published on an unspecified date, discusses the FDA's authorization of the first COVID-19 diagnostic test that detects chemical compounds in breath samples associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer was shown to have 91.2% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity in a study of 2,409 individuals. The test is intended to be used in environments such as doctor's offices, hospitals, and mobile testing sites.\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-03-10, states that you can monitor yourself for COVID-19 with a breath test.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is true that a breath test for COVID-19 has been developed and authorized for emergency use by the FDA. However, the information does not specify if this test is available for personal use or if it is intended for use in a clinical setting. Additionally, the test is intended to detect chemical compounds associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, not the virus itself. Therefore, it is partially true that you can monitor yourself for COVID-19 with a breath test, but it is important to note that the test is not widely available for personal use and it is not a replacement for a molecular test.", "response": "FALSE."}

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24]. Vitamin C has many properties that make it a valuable therapeutic agent for respiratory infections.\nThis may provide timely data on the possible preventive and therapeutic values of vitamin C for medical and public interest in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is “a gross misinterpretation” of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nThat specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says.\nThe 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation most likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers gave only the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.\nEven someone who does not have another health condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.

This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.

If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage.

The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I.

The destruction caused by that pandemic a century ago may sound familiar. Yet, direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, according to one scientist.\n“We’re talking about young individuals who were in a congregate setting at a time when vaccination overall was not that prevalent,” he says. “We didn’t fully know about disease spread as much. We knew about hygiene but didn’t understand that with a highly transmissible virus, basic sanitation measures such as hand washing weren’t going to cover you.” · Had certain conditions that occurred during the 1918 flu pandemic been replicated a century later, Srivastava suggests, we might have seen a greater impact of COVID-19 on young adults.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-03, states that the 1918 flu pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, killed more than 50 million people worldwide. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population was infected. At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this flu strain. Social distancing measures were implemented, such as closing schools, theaters, churches, and businesses, as well as requiring the use of masks and setting up makeshift morgues.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2010-10-12, provides a detailed account of the Spanish flu pandemic. It killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States. The pandemic was caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, which was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. There were no vaccines or effective treatments available at the time.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-07-17, clarifies that vaccines were not available during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, as the flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s. The post warns of the ill effects of vaccines, but this information is inaccurate.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not available, states that pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine for the Spanish flu, but they were too late as the virus disappeared before they could isolate it.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, mentions that direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, as our understanding of COVID-19 is still developing.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-07-26, states that vaccines killed 50 million people during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. However, the provided information and existing knowledge indicate that vaccines were not available during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s, which is after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic occurred. Therefore, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

Prior to that, only a few isolated cases had been seen on the island. Internationally, vaccines existed for meningitis types A and C, but not for type B.\nCuban health authorities secured a vaccine from a French pharmaceutical company to immunise the population against type C meningitis. However, in the following years, cases of type B began to rise. A team of specialists from different medical science centres was established, led by a woman biochemist, Concepción Campa, to work intensively on finding a vaccine.\nBy 1984, meningitis B had become the most serious health problem in Cuba. After six years of intense work, Campa’s team produced the world’s first successful meningitis B vaccine in 1988. A member of Campa’s team, Dr Gustavo Sierra recalled their joy:\nBetween 1989 and 1990, the three million Cubans most at risk were vaccinated. Subsequently, 250,000 young people were vaccinated with the VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine, a combined vaccine for meningitis types B and C.

NASA is responsible for aeronautical and aerospace research and has conducted studies on the use of chlorine dioxide for various applications, primarily in water treatment and disinfection in spaceflight environments.\n\nInformation 3 is about Alcide, a disinfectant/deodorizer that is not a direct spinoff from aerospace technology but has benefited from assistance provided by NERAC, Inc. Alcide uses chlorine dioxide as one of its formulations.\n\nInformation 4 is about a documentary titled \"The Universal Antidote\" that claims NASA proclaimed chlorine dioxide as a universal antidote in 1987. However, this information contradicts the previous sources.\n\nInformation 5 is a narrative review examining the controversy surrounding the use of aqueous chlorine dioxide as a cure for COVID-19.\n\nJudgment on the claim:\n\nThe claim that NASA used cathologized chlorine dioxide as a universal antidote in 1988 is false. NASA has conducted research on the use of chlorine dioxide for various applications, but there is no evidence that it has declared it as a universal antidote. Additionally, the publication date of the claim (2021-02-04) is after the publication dates of the sources that contradict the claim.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim is directly contradicted by Information 1 and 2, which provide clear evidence that NASA did not declare chlorine dioxide as a universal antidote in 1988. The publication dates of Information 1 and 2 are also before the publication date of the claim, making it unlikely that the claim is based on new information that was not available at the time of the publication of Information 1 and 2.\n\nFurthermore, Information 4, which supports the claim, is a documentary that was released on February 1, 2021, which is before the publication date of the claim. However, this information contradicts the previous sources, making it less reliable.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the sequential relationship between the date of publication of the claim and the date of publication of the information, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

There was no such adjustment. Florida has become a focal point in the nation’s struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19.

This impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions. However, poorly controlled OSA in this subset of individuals takes a heavy toll on patient care due to the increased risk of medical errors and can also alter the mental and physical well-being of the affected HCW in various ways.\nIn these circumstances, when a HCW with poorly controlled OSA works during a healthcare shift, their work productivity is impaired, which impacts their ability to provide patient care. Studies indicate a strong relationship between OSA and workplace accidents when compared to all other sleep disorders, with a relative odds ratio of 2.88 [48]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational accidents in workers with OSA revealed that the odds of work accidents were nearly doubled in workers with OSA compared to those without OSA [49]. A cross-sectional study in Thailand and Malaysia showed that 40.4% of young physicians have OSA.\nThe incidence of fatigue, SD, and perception of inadequate sleep amongst these individuals was 65.4%, 44.2%, and 61.5%, respectively [50]. Additionally, a cross-sectional study involving the screening of sleep disorders revealed that 40.9% of healthcare workers reported at least one type of sleep disorder [37]. SD is a prominent symptom of OSA, and the effects of SD are well known (Table 1). A survey revealed that over one-third of physicians felt sleep-deprived every week, impacting patient care and safety. This survey also showed that physicians suffered from several side effects of SD, such as poor concentration, impaired decision-making, and mental health issues.\nThis impact is seen in healthcare workers (HCWs) who are not immune to these conditions.

Probably Not, ...\nContent:\nWithout being alarmist, the rising temperatures mean the inside of your car will get hot very quickly—so don't leave a bottle of hand sanitizer in there, just in case. ... The fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode.\nIf you're carrying alcohol-based hand sanitizer wherever you go, congratulations—it's what we've been advised to do by public-health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic. However, don't leave it inside your car, because the very alcohol that helps kill germs is also very flammable.\nThe fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, has issued a warning that alcohol-based sanitizer bottles should not be left in cars because there's a possibility they could explode. Their warning is echoed by the National Fire Protection Association, which issued a video (below) in April saying hand sanitizer's flash point is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which means a bottle of it doesn't need any external heat source to give off flammable vapors. All it would then need is a flame source—someone smoking in the car, for instance—for it to be in danger of explosion. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid \"which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\"\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-05-28\nTitle: Can hand sanitiser catch fire in a hot car? - Full Fact\nContent:\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363°C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side. So that’s much higher than 35°C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to. We don’t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\nIn the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24°C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22°C and 23°C. At these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it’s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they’ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire. But that doesn’t mean hand sanitiser left in a car that gets warmer than this will ignite on its own, unless there is a spark.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-05-22\nTitle: Will Hand Sanitizer Combust If Left in a Hot Car? | Snopes.com\nContent:\nIt tends to burn relatively cool, compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires with peak flame temperatures between 500° and 1000°F. The observed temperatures above the flame were higher for the liquid hand sanitizer compared to the gel. Hand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes: ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which readily evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid.\n\"Deixar Alcool Em Gel No Console Exposto ao Sol Faz o Carro Pegar Fogo?\" Quatro Rodas. 20 April 2020.

Cavage, William. \"Flammability Test of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer.\"\nFor starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame. A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we've yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way.\nSoon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion. For starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame.

Pagendarm posted a photo of a flyer titled “Safety Alert: Risk of Leaving Hand Sanitizer in Hot Vehicles,” which depicted an image of a burnt car door and the specialty contractor company Quanta Services Inc. logo.\nColonna stressed that because most ABHS containers are small, extreme heat is more likely to burn away the alcohol and make the containers leak than ignite a fire. Storing hand sanitizer in a car for more than a few hours can lead the alcohol to evaporate, which can make it less effective. “If you want it to remain effective, in terms of killing the virus or bacteria, you wouldn’t want to keep it in your car anyways,” Verzoni said.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Is It Safe To Keep Hand Sanitizer In A Hot Car? - Texas A&M Today\nContent:\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water are not readily available. But is it safe to leave hand sanitizer in your car on a hot day? And if so, for how long? A recent viral photo taken in Brazil of a burned car door, apparently a result of keeping hand sanitizer near an open flame in a car, warned of the dangers of keeping hand sanitizer in vehicles on a hot day.\n“If you’re using a hand sanitizer fairly regularly and keeping it in a shaded area of the car, somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, I don’t think you’re going to have much of an issue with that.” · The incidence of fires is rare when it comes to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but the CDC does recommend that hand sanitizer be stored safely to avoid any possible issues of concern.\n\nInformation summary:\n\n* Hand sanitizers typically contain alcohol that readily evaporates into an ignitable vapor at room temperature. The flash point of hand sanitizer is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it can give off flammable vapors without needing an external heat source.\n* However, hand sanitizer will not ignite on its own at higher temperatures; it requires an external source of ignition.\n* Hand sanitizer containers are small and more likely to leak or become less effective due to alcohol evaporation from extreme heat rather than igniting a fire.\n* There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.\n* Hand sanitizer should be stored safely and away from recognized ignition sources.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that \"Don’t left alcohol gel in your car, it could burn and explode\" is mostly false. Hand sanitizer can give off flammable vapors at room temperature, and at higher temperatures it requires an external source of ignition to ignite. The likelihood of hand sanitizer igniting in a car is rare, and it is more probable that extreme heat will cause the alcohol to evaporate, reducing the hand sanitizer's effectiveness or causing it to leak. There is no official report of a car fire caused by hand sanitizer spontaneous combustion.", "response": "FALSE."}

We rate this claim as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The breath test is an ineffective way to test for fibrosis, which has not been linked to COVID-19.\nAmid the sea of misinformation circulating social media, a self-check for COVID-19 is popping up on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp. Social media users claim people can test themselves for COVID-19 every day by attempting to hold their breath for 10 seconds.\nThe March 13 post claimed the breath test checked for fibrosis caused by COVID-19. The post read, “By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late.”\nThe WHO warns that hot baths and warm climates do not prevent the spread of COVID-19. USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user, Todd Richardson, for comment and received no response. Social media posts claim holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Monitoring Lung Function At Home | NIH COVID-19 Research\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has limited regular visits to the doctor, which can make it difficult for patients with lung disease to keep track of their lung health. People with a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) have to visit their doctors regularly to monitor how well their lungs are working. This is often done using a spirometry test.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has limited regular doctor’s office visits. It has also raised safety concerns about the visits that do occur. For example, people using spirometers could spew infectious particles into the air. Patients with other chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, already use home spirometry to monitor their condition. A guided at-home spirometer, like the one used in this study, could reduce visits to the doctor and help people with LAM and other chronic lung diseases better track their lung health.\nA guided at-home spirometer, like the one used in this study, could reduce visits to the doctor and help people with LAM and other chronic lung diseases better track their lung health.

See FDA instructions on repeat testing.\nSymptoms, testing, what to do if sick, daily activities, and more.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by the American Lung Association, explains the process of using a self-test for COVID-19, including purchasing the test, collecting a specimen, performing the test, and disposing of it. It also mentions antibody tests, which involve drawing blood and testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody tests cannot determine current infection, as it takes one to three weeks after infection for the body to produce antibodies.\n\nInformation 2, published by Precision Medical, Inc., discusses how to test lung capacity at home, which is not related to COVID-19 testing.\n\nInformation 3, published by USA TODAY, debunks the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19, rating it as FALSE.\n\nInformation 4, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discusses monitoring lung function at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for people with chronic lung diseases. It mentions the use of spirometry tests to monitor lung health, but it does not mention COVID-19 self-testing.\n\nInformation 5, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), explains COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and what to do if sick. It also mentions self-tests and provides a video on what to do if the self-test result is positive.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that this is how to test your lung for COVID-19 self-check. However, none of the provided information supports this claim directly. Information 1 and 5 mention COVID-19 self-tests, but they do not specifically mention testing lungs. Instead, they explain the process of using a self-test, including collecting a specimen and performing the test. Information 3 debunks the claim that holding your breath for 10 seconds is a self-check for COVID-19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely referring to the use of a self-test for COVID-19, not specifically testing lung function. However, the claim is still misleading, as it implies that the self-test specifically checks lung function, which is not the case.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially true but mostly misleading. Therefore, it is more accurate to classify the claim as \"partly true, mostly misleading.\"", "response": "FALSE."}
