Although the symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by different viruses.\nBoth the flu and COVID-19 spread in similar ways. Droplets or smaller virus particles from a sick person can transmit the virus to other people nearby. The smallest particles may linger in the air, and another person can inhale them and become infected.\nFlu: A vaccine is available and effective in preventing some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity or duration of the flu. The flu vaccine is reformulated every year in anticipation of the influenza strains that are expected to circulate. It is very important to get vaccinated for the flu as the COVID pandemic continues.\nLisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, explains how the flu and COVID-19 are similar and how they are different.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: PolitiFact | No, WHO has not said COVID-19 no worse than the flu\nContent:\nCorrectiv, which is based in Germany and is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, found in October 2020 that the WHO did not confirm that COVID-19 is less bad than the flu.

The posts and images on social media claim that the ventilators are not being distributed to hospitals, accompanied by a photo of ventilators in a warehouse. The photo was taken on March 24, 2020, during a press conference held by mayor Bill de Blasio at the New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) warehouse in Brooklyn.\n\nNew York agencies and officials in charge of ventilator deployment have contradicted the claim, stating that the ventilators were received and transferred by the agency within 24 hours. The photo, taken by Scott Lynch for Gothamist, shows 400 ventilators that were received and transferred by NYCEM within a day.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nGiven the information presented, the claim that the ventilators are stuck in a warehouse is false. The photo of the ventilators was taken on March 24, 2020, and the ventilators were transferred to hospitals within 24 hours. Therefore, the claim made in social media posts that the ventilators are stuck in a warehouse is misleading and incorrect.\n\nMoreover, the claim that Democrats are stashing ventilators in a warehouse to worsen the pandemic is also false. Officials were storing the ventilators in the warehouse so they could be sent out to hospitals as needed. New York had requested 30,000 ventilators for when cases were expected to peak in subsequent weeks.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that ventilators sent to New York for COVID-19 treatment are stuck in a warehouse is false. The ventilators were received and transferred to hospitals within 24 hours, and officials were storing them in a warehouse to be distributed to hospitals as needed.", "response": "FALSE."}

The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre\nFurther, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus. Nucleic acid vaccines make available stable antigenic expression (into delivery plasmid by genetic engineering) which is known to stimulate relatively lesser but constant immune responses [25]. Further, nucleic acid vaccines are cloned antigenic protein materials that mimic the natural infection and can be manufacture relatively in a short period of time [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]]. The nucleic acid vaccine is considered as safer alternative than that of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines which are used currently to acquire immunity against dengue, malaria, typhoid and anthrax etc [25,71].

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers were able to come up with vaccines for this new virus much faster because of work that was already happening. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews and evaluates COVID-19 vaccines for quality, safety, and effectiveness. The FDA then issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain vaccines that meet rigorous, science-based standards. The FDA determines that these vaccines are safe and effective for public use.\nDecember 18, 2020 FDA issued the second EUA for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 18 years and older for the prevention of COVID-19. The federal government has been working since the pandemic started to develop, manufacture, and distribute safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\nSeptember 11, 2023 FDA approved and authorized the emergency use of the updated Moderna and -BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines formulated to better protect against currently circulating variants · April 18, 2023 FDA amended the emergency use authorization to simplify the vaccination schedule for bivalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 vaccines\nContent:\nWhen monovalent XBB vaccines are not available, any available WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified vaccine, bivalent variant-containing or monovalent index virus vaccines, may be used since they continue to provide benefits against severe disease in high-risk groups.

Indigenous nations' own codes and policies can be instituted to bolster this response, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US (Hiraldo et al., 2021).\nIn Australia, there are early indications of establishing regional data infrastructure so Indigenous nations can use data for development (National Agreement on Closing the Gap, 2020). One policy proposal to assist in the current COVID-19 environment for Indigenous communities to respond to COVID-19 is to invest in technological solutions such as a syndromic surveillance system for Indigenous community-controlled/based data systems where there are options to do so, and appropriate Indigenous data governance can be applied.\nData sharing involves both the release of tribal information as well as the sharing of tribal information that other governments hold, such as COVID-19 related data, with tribes. A number of states and the federal government have denied tribal rights to access data for decision-making (Tahir and Cancryn, 2020). There is a recognized need for other governments and organizations to establish data sharing agreements and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples (Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Indigenous Data Working Group, 2020; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).\nThe United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2020); World Health Organization (2020), and the Pan American Health Organization (del Pino and Camacho, 2020) call for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data (direct and indirect) and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples. In the US, there has been a call for the availability of data disaggregated by Indigenous nations and tribal affiliation themselves, with the caveat that this must be done within the context of Indigenous governance of those data, including data sharing agreements (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous Communities in Canada | The Health ...\nContent:\nPurpose: The purpose of this literature review was to explore the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. Methods: A literature review was conducted in June 2021. An infographic was created after a review of the literature. Results: Many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism.\nResults: Many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing. Conclusion: Indigenous communities in Canada are successfully persevering through the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining culturally relevant connections with family-centred and land-based approaches to physical health and wellness that have been practiced for generations.\nJocelyn Benji, Rosalin Miles, Be air safe: HEPA filters as an air ventilation resource to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in Canadian elementary and high schools , The Health & Fitness Journal of Canada: Vol. 14 No. 4 (2021)\nIndigenous storytelling as research.

The paper states that of these, 109 were from villages, 23 were from urban non-slum areas and 25 were from urban slum areas. Given the unequal urban-rural division of participants, 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive. This indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\nThis indicates, among other things, that India’s COVID-19 epidemic had by then spread to the rural parts, despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets. However, as the epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya has cautioned, extrapolating the survey’s results to all of India may not be so straightforward since most of India’s cases are at present in urban centres whereas 73.8% of individuals in the survey were from rural areas.\nWhile he didn’t provide a stratum-wise breakdown, the paper is clearer: 15 districts were classified as ‘zero cases’, 22 districts as ‘low’, 16 districts as ‘medium’ and 17 districts as ‘high’. The seroprevalence across all four strata ranged from 0.62% to 1.03%. Also read: What You Need to Know Before Trying to Make Sense of Sero-Survey Results · However, the researchers cautioned that four of the 15 districts in the survey (and out of 233 such districts in India, per the paper) with ‘zero cases’ didn’t have COVID-19 testing laboratories at the district headquarters and that samples collected in the area for tests had to be transported to state-headquarter hospitals.\n“The present findings of seropositivity in the strata of districts with zero to low incidence of COVID-19 cases underscores the need to strengthen surveillance and augment the testing of suspected cases in these areas,” the researchers conclude. On July 10, PTI had reported that ICMR would conduct “a nationwide seroprevalence survey to determine the exposure of the novel coronavirus among the population … as a follow-up” to the one conducted in May-June.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 is the official website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.\n\nInformation 2 is about a study conducted by ICMR that found that Indian food habits and ingredients, such as idli, rajma, zinc, fiber, and catechins present in tea, may have played an important role in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India. The study compared transcriptome profiles of COVID-19 patients from south India (Karnataka) and north India (Haryana) with those of Western populations.\n\nInformation 3 is about the importance of data sharing and mechanisms with Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous nations' own codes and policies, such as data sharing requirements and relationships as part of tribal public health codes in the US. The information also highlights the need for the inclusion of identifiers or affiliation for Indigenous Peoples and individuals in COVID-19 data and the need to make those data available to decision-makers and Indigenous Peoples.\n\nInformation 4 is a literature review of the experiences and responses to COVID-19 for Indigenous communities in Canada, specifically looking at the physical health and wellness in these communities. The review found that many Indigenous communities in Canada experience the disproportional effects from historical and ongoing health pandemics due to factors such as social determinants of health, the effects of intergenerational trauma, and systemic racism. However, Indigenous communities have found strengths in community-led initiatives that focus on promoting overall spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nInformation 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey. The survey found that 0.52% of those sampled in rural areas and 0.66% of those sampled in urban areas tested positive, indicating that India's COVID-19 epidemic had spread to rural parts despite multiple claims at the time that it was still confined to urban pockets.\n\nClaim: As per ICMR study there’s been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. Information 2 is an ICMR study that focused on the role of food habits and ingredients in reducing the severity and high death rate of COVID-19 in India, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them. Information 5 is about ICMR's first sero-survey paper that found that India missed 81 infections in its first sero-survey, but it did not mention anything about indigenous Assamese communities or the absence of COVID-19 cases among them. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that there has been not a single case of COVID-19 among indigenous Assamese communities in India.", "response": "FALSE."}

In these rare stem cells—the parents of immune-system cells—taken from people recovering from COVID-19, the scientists identified changes in the instructions for which genes got turned on or off. These changes were passed down to daughter cells, leading them to boost production of immune cells called monocytes. In the monocytes from people recovering from severe COVID-19, the changes in gene expression led the cells to pump out greater amounts of molecules called inflammatory cytokines than monocytes from people who were healthy or had non-COVID-19 illnesses.\nThese changes may help explain why the disease can damage so many different organs and why some people with long COVID have high levels of inflammation throughout the body.

Here, immunostaining reveals increased levels of the adhesion molecule PECAM-1 on endothelial cells in brain tissue from patients who died from COVID-19.\nThe scientists found evidence that antibodies—proteins produced by the immune system in response to viruses and other invaders—are involved in an attack on the cells lining the brain’s blood vessels, leading to inflammation and damage. Consistent with an earlier study from the group, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the patients’ brains, suggesting the virus was not infecting the brain directly. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 can trigger brain damage may help inform development of therapies for COVID-19 patients who have lingering neurological symptoms.\nFor the first time, researchers observed deposits of immune complexes—molecules formed when antibodies bind antigens (foreign substances)—on the surface of endothelial cells in the brains of COVID-19 patients. Such immune complexes can damage tissue by triggering inflammation. The study builds on their previous research, which found evidence of brain damage caused by thinning and leaky blood vessels. They suspected that the damage may have been due to the body’s natural inflammatory response to the virus.\nNath and his team found that antibodies produced in response to COVID-19 may mistakenly target cells crucial to the blood-brain barrier.

But the WHO says, “Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C [97.7 to 98.6], regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.” But a normal, warm bath?\nSo to put it another way, drinking water won't keep the coronavirus from getting in your airways and lungs and taking up shop there and causing COVID-19. The best use of water to prevent COVID-19: You knew “wash your hands” was going to come up somewhere, so here there it is.\nOf course, you should still drink water and bathe as you like in a day. Just don’t expect either of those uses of water to miraculously protect you from COVID-19. Get a refresher from the CDC on what does actually help protect you from the disease here. ...

However, most transmission occurs from close contact or droplet transmission.\nWhile drinking enough water to stay hydrated is important, drinking sips of water every 15 minutes does not prevent infection from COVID-19.

There have been many claims to the contrary circulating widely on social media and in private messaging apps – one of the many fake pieces of health advice that are being shared. One claim that hot water would be enough to protect people from the virus even led the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) to issue a statement to say that it had not come from them. “There is no evidence that hot drinks will protect against viral infections,” says Ron Eccles, an expert in respiratory diseases at Cardiff University in the UK and former director of the Common Cold Centre.\nThe hot drink does not, however, get rid of the virus causing the infection in the first place. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease Covid-19, BBC Future has already examined how drinking water doesn’t offer any protection against the new coronavirus.\nThe temperatures needed to kill Covid-19 are high enough to scald us and cause serious injury (Credit: Getty Images) It’s easy to see how climbing into a bath that hot, as some fake advice has suggested, would be hard to stand for long, and likely do more harm than good.

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution.\nSince a cure and treatment to COVID-19 is yet unavailable, the World Health Organization (WHO) and health system regulators advise social distancing as the main weapon to fight the pandemic (CDC 2020, 6 May; WHO 2020, 29 April). In the strictest forms, social distancing measures may be enforced through a partial or complete nation-wide lockdowns or nation-wide or region-specific mobility restrictions. An increasing amount of discussion suggests that such measures have substantially reduced all kinds of pollutant emissions to the environment driving the air quality up across the world as industrial production, construction and vehicular movement decline dramatically (Le Quéré et al., 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Wang and Su, 2020).\nEnvironmentalists and researchers are calling this pandemic a “blessing in disguise”- as lockdowns have drastically reduced air pollution (Muhammad et al., 2020). Human activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).\nHuman activities driven air pollution is normally one of the leading causes of health crisis, inequality, and deaths around the world (Yang and Liu, 2018; Lin and Zhu, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). The pandemic has caused reduced air pollution as public mobility is halted, airlines being shut down, and other highway transportation being canceled, which gives us the opportunity to breathe in a low carbon air (Monks 2020, April 20).\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The world faces an air pollution 'pandemic' | EurekAlert ...\nContent:\nProfessors Jos Lelieveld and Thomas Münzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Department of Cardiology of the University Medical Centre Mainz in Mainz, Germany, who led the research, say the findings suggest the world is facing an air pollution \"pandemic\".

In view of the coronavirus risk, Muslim leaders around the world, including in the U.S., have aligned their religious opinions with public health experts. Muslim institutions have begun to recommend that people make sure to wash their hands for 20 seconds with soap before doing wudu. Emphasizing that wudu alone cannot prevent the virus from spreading, other Islamic institutions recommend that mosques supply extra soap and hand sanitizer near the washing area.\nPreparing for prayer by washing one’s body using water can be a deeply spiritual act for Muslims. Islamic studies scholar Paul Powers argues it isn’t “empty ritualism,” but an embodied practice that helps the individual center on an inner religiosity.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 1998-07-20\nTitle: Ablution | Purification, Rituals & Hygiene | Britannica\nContent:\nThe upper-caste Hindu bathes ceremonially in water before performing daily morning worship (pūjā) in the home. Jewish law requires ritual immersion of their whole bodies by women prior to marriage and after menstruation, as well as by new converts to Judaism. Washing of the hands after rising in the morning and before meals that include bread are also examples of ablution in Judaism.\nMuslim piety requires that the devout wash their hands, feet, and face before each of the five daily prayers; the use of sand is permitted where water is unavailable. Like most ritual acts, ablution may carry a wide range of meanings to those who perform it. The stain of ritual uncleanness may be felt to be as real as contamination with unseen germs is for the medically minded; the act of cleansing may be only a gesture, symbolic of desired purity of soul.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1 (Publication date: 2020-03-19): A report by Gosulsel.com on January 27, 2020, cites a doctor claiming that Islamic ablution water can destroy the coronavirus.

The first-ever national state of emergency was decreed on October 25, 2020, primarily to introduce a curfew from midnight until six in the morning in order to tackle the widespread between young people in social gatherings. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court of Spain ruled that both COVID states of alarm had been unconstitutional.\nThe state of alarm is declared by the government through a decree passed by the Council of Ministers for a maximum period of 15 days, reporting to the Congress of Deputies, gathered immediately for this purpose. Without the Congress authorization said period may not be extended, and said decree will establish the scope and conditions binding during its duration.\nIn Spain the state of alarm (estado de alarma) is the lowest of the three degrees of state of emergency that allows the government to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. It is regulated in the article 116.2 of the Constitution of Spain.\nIt can be declared in all of Spain or parts of it in these cases: Serious risk, catastrophe or public calamity, such as earthquakes, floods, urban and forest fires, or major accidents. Health crises, such as epidemics and serious contamination situations. Situations of shortages of basic necessity products. Paralysis of essential public services for the community if any of the above circumstances or situations concur.

But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines.\nThe only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example.\nBut posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past.\nOther posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates.

Lastly, it was falsely reported that Bill Gates had said that 700,000 people would be injured or die from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Tim Nguyen, the head of high impact events preparedness unit at WHO, “You need to have a certain degree of good information out there to reach populations so that they are inoculated and not susceptible to fake news or disinformation…we believe we need to vaccinate 30% of the population with good information in order to have a certain degree of herd immunity against misinformation” [48]. Websites that provide evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines should be developed and disseminated globally as the use of such trusted sources of information have been found effective against misinformation and conspiracy theories [11].\nRumors about the use of vaccination campaigns for political purposes are not new, and such rumors have previously affected vaccination campaigns in some countries, such as Pakistan [38]. During a public health emergency, when there is considerable scientific uncertainty, and political leaders act as frontline crises managers, it often becomes challenging to ensure evidenced-based recommendation over political interest [35]. For example, the statement, “Whether the vaccine comes or not, coronavirus will leave the country” made by a health minister is likely to confuse the public about the necessity of the vaccine [39]. It thus may affect vaccine acceptancy. The claim that vaccine against COVID-19 had already been invented may lead some to come to the conclusion that this pandemic was being used in an attempt to further vaccine sales [40, 41].

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, so mask-wearing and social distancing are important for curbing spread. While his research was conducted in a laboratory, Richt says that it was done “in an environment which mimics normal circumstances.” · “The question we were looking to answer was ‘Can houseflies acquire the virus?’ The answer is yes,” he says.\nHowever, their ability to spread the virus is likely limited. \"The second part of our study (the transmission study) showed that flies did not transmit detectable infectious virus,\" Nayduch says. \"All we could detect was the genome of the virus (it’s RNA) which is not infectious. We have no evidence houseflies would be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\" Overall, infectious disease experts are skeptical about a fly's ability to transmit the disease.\n“Houseflies can carry a range of viruses and bacteria but, just because you can find that something can mechanically transfer a virus, doesn’t necessarily equate to an epidemiological risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell. “This is not how COVID-19 is spread.”\nDon’t panic and assume the flies buzzing around your home will give you COVID-19.

Although, this video was recorded and posted by India’s most popular star Amitabh Bachchan the claim is absolutely false.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2020, explains the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, where they found that houseflies can carry the COVID-19 virus but are unlikely to transmit it. The study showed that while the virus's genetic material could be detected on the flies, no infectious virus was found. Infectious disease experts emphasize that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making the likelihood of flies spreading the disease very low.\n\nInformation 2, published in 2020, is a fact-check addressing a viral WhatsApp forward and a tweet by Amitabh Bachchan claiming that a new study by China proved houseflies could transmit the coronavirus. The forward also mentioned that the Government of India had confirmed this information. The fact-check concluded that this claim was false.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, is a brief abstract from a parasitology journal discussing the background of SARS-CoV-2 and mentioning a study on mechanical transmission of the virus by house flies. However, the abstract does not provide any details about the study or its findings.\n\nInformation 4, published in 2021, reports on a study conducted by researchers at Kansas State University and the Agricultural Research Service. The study found that house flies can acquire and harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 hours after exposure.\n\nInformation 5, published in 2020, is a fact-check debunking a misleading video claiming that flies can spread the coronavirus if they come into contact with infected human faeces. The fact-check confirms that this claim is false.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim, published in 2020, states that experts in China found that the coronavirus can be spread through houseflies. However, the information available does not support this claim. Information 1, 3, and 5 contradict the claim, stating that while houseflies can carry the virus, there is no evidence to suggest they can transmit it. Information 2 is a fact-check that debunks the claim, and Information 4, published after the claim, reports on a study showing that houseflies can carry the virus for up to 24 hours but does not provide evidence of transmission.\n\nTherefore, the claim is mostly likely false, as there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that houseflies can spread the coronavirus.", "response": "FALSE."}

Information 4 and 5 confirm that the photographs are from a campaign event for Joe Biden held in Detroit, Michigan, on March 9, 2020.\n\nClaim Accuracy:\n\nThe claim that photos show Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just attended a rally without wearing face masks or socially distancing is false. The photographs were taken at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9, weeks before face masks and other social distancing guidelines were first implemented in the United States. Therefore, the claim is misleading as it implies that the photograph was taken recently, during a time when wearing masks and social distancing are required.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on August 20, 2020, while the photographs were taken on March 9, 2020, as confirmed by multiple sources. This sequential relationship between the claim and the information indicates that the claim is incorrect, as it implies that the photograph was taken recently, during a time when wearing masks and social distancing are required. However, the information clearly states that the photographs were taken before the CDC recommended wearing masks and before Michigan announced its first presumptive positive coronavirus case.

The highest peaks of a higher-than-average number of deaths during the first registration of COVID-19 cases in March-April 2020 were initially recorded in Italy and Spain, followed by France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nDuring the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rates in the EU were recorded in Spain (80.8 %), Belgium (73.1 %) and the Netherlands (53.8 %). Four other countries had a greater than 35.0 % increase in the number of deaths in April 2020, namely Italy (41.7 %, although the highest increase had already occurred in March at 49.6 %), Sweden (38.2 %), Ireland (38.0 %) and France (36.4 %). However, excess mortality spiked in several countries in other months of 2020: Malta in August (24.4 %), Cyprus in May (26.4 %), Portugal in July (25.8 %). In these countries, a relatively stable early summer period (compared with the 2016-2019 baseline) followed the high increase in mortality in the spring.\nFor the purpose of the excess mortality indicator, the death figures for the latest weeks available in a Member State are corrected for incompleteness. Data from 2021 remain provisional and subject to revision with the next releases. Thirty-one countries provide weekly mortality data: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nStarting from September 2020, the increase was higher and more widespread, reaching new peaks in November, with significant rates in Poland (97.0 %), Bulgaria (94.0 %), Slovenia (91.3 %), Czechia (75.8 %), Romania (62.6 %) and Hungary (59.2 %). Countries with high values in spring 2020 recorded high excess mortality rates again in November 2020: Belgium (58.8 %), Italy (51.6 %), Austria (47.3 %), Malta (40.2 %), France (31.3 %) and Spain (24.4 %).\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A ...\nContent:\nFrance’s deaths began around mid-March but the rate was slower than for Italy and Spain. France’s curve started to flatten in mid-May. The total growth of number of cases was slower for Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Austria (except for Germany, all relatively small populations, Belgium = 11.5 million; Netherlands = 17 million; Austria = 9 million). In the United Kingdom (population = 68 million) the number of deaths did not start to grow rapidly until early April but then increased sharply and continued to June.\nGiven the incubation period to hospitalization of roughly 14 days of Covid-19 and 14 days beyond that for death to occur, a “flattening of the curve” should be observed within about 28 days to one month of lockdown. In Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.\nIn Fig 1 (Total cases), we do see such a phenomenon for Austria and Germany but not for Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.

They must admit all students who wish to attend and have certain attendance preferences. Charter schools were first adopted in California in 1992 with the purpose of improving pupil learning and increasing learning opportunities.\n\nInformation 2 provides details about state schools in various countries, including South Africa, Canada, and Argentina. It explains that state schools are funded by taxation and educate all students without charge. In some places, students are required to attend school until the age of 16, 18, or until they graduate from high school.\n\nInformation 3 explains that attending public schools in another district or state depends on regulations in place for the state and local school districts. Schools receive funds based on average daily attendance, and if a student moves out, the ADA goes down, resulting in fewer dollars sent to the school.\n\nInformation 4 explains how state and local dollars fund public schools. Once dollars are allocated to a school district, the district is responsible for constructing its own budget and having it approved by a school board or district council. The budget details where dollars will go within the school system, including central office departments, schools, facilities, and capital projects.\n\nInformation 5 provides details about opening a vocational school in NYC, including the importance of understanding the state's requirements and the availability of qualified instructors and other mandatory staff. The New York Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision offers support for those looking to start a vocational school in the state.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that opening schools is a local determination, not a state determination.\n\nAccording to Information 4, once dollars are allocated to a school district, the district is responsible for constructing its own budget and having its budget approved by a school board or district council. This suggests that while state funds are allocated to school districts, the decision to open schools is made at the local level. Information 1 also supports this claim, as charter schools in California operate independently from the existing school district structure.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is TRUE. Opening schools is a local determination, not a state determination.", "response": "FALSE."}

No information was found about a rise in COVID-19 cases specific to Boston around the time of the claim. Therefore, the claim might be misleading, as it implies that the decision to hold the conference digitally was made because of a rise in cases in Boston, while the actual reason was the growing concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in general.\n\nHowever, the claim does not explicitly state that the decision was made because of a rise in cases in Boston.

This virus appears to have originated within Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17,18,19. In 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\nHowever, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population.\nBat-handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705). Samples were stored in viral transport medium at −80 °C directly after collection.\nIn 2019, a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) causing respiratory illness (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. This emerging human virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, and also appears to have originated in horseshoe bats20,21—with its full genome 96% similar to a viral sequence reported from Rhinolophus affinis20. Closely related sequences were also identified in Malayan pangolins22,23. A growing body of research has identified bats as the evolutionary sources of SARS—and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—CoVs13,14,24,25,26, and as the source of progenitors for the human CoVs, NL63 and 229E27,28.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-01-30\nTitle: False: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the ...\nContent:\nExplanation: The current analysis indicate that there is no <strong>pig</strong> element in <strong>the</strong> <strong>virus</strong>. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Wuhan</strong> <strong>coronavirus</strong> originated mostly from SARS <strong>and</strong> <strong>bats</strong>, not from <strong>pigs</strong>.

Pigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species.\nPigs and humans have very similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species. Moreover, a team at Zhejiang University in the Chinese city of Hangzhou found that the SADS virus could infect cells from many organisms in a petri dish, including rodents, chickens, nonhuman primates and humans. Given the scale of swine farming in many countries, such as China and the U.S., Gray says, looking for novel coronaviruses in pigs should be a top priority.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mystery virus found in Wuhan resembles bat viruses but not SARS, ...\nContent:\nSo far, the novel <strong>coronavirus</strong> has been found in 15 patients; no new cases reported since 5 January\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Cross-Species Transmission of Coronaviruses in Humans ...\nContent:\nPubMed Abstract | CrossRef Full Text | Google Scholar · 90.

Its ancestor probably originated in bats, since SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the 2013 and 2019 isolates from horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China at the genome level, although not at the RBD level, suggesting neither might bind to human ACE2, and are thus not immediate ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 (72, 74, 75).\n90.

Nonetheless, civets may have amplified the virus and brought it closer to humans (35). Additional mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, common marmosets, grivets, and cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be infected under experimental inoculation, seroconvert, and display similar pathological signs as humans, and the monkeys and guinea pigs usually display mild clinical signs, while cats and golden hamsters show no clinical signs (36–44).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: A study conducted by Tufts University and Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences found that bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. They also discovered a virus in pigs in 2016, SADS-CoV, which originated from bats and can infect various organisms, including humans.\n\nInformation 2: A fact-checking article by TEMPO states that the Wuhan coronavirus did not originate from a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus. Instead, it originated mostly from SARS and bats.\n\nInformation 3: An article discussing how China's 'Bat Woman' hunted down viruses from SARS to the new coronavirus states that pigs and humans have similar immune systems, making it easy for viruses to cross between the two species.

However, they are not immediately related to the human ACE2 receptor.\n\nClaim: Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus.\n\nBased on the provided information, the claim is false. Information 1, 3, and 5 all indicate that while bats are the evolutionary source of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence to suggest that the Wuhan coronavirus is a cross between the bat virus and the pig virus.

Key findings include the following: Multiple analyses of available federal, state, and local data show that people of color are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths. They show particularly large disparities in cases and deaths for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people and widespread disparities in cases among Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts.\nAnalyses further find that disparities in COVID-19 related deaths persist across age groups and that people of color experience more deaths among younger people relative to White individuals. There is limited data and research to understand of impacts for subgroups, such as immigrants, who may be at increased risk. Data show that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. For example, data from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) show that, from March through July 18, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people were roughly five times higher than that of White people.\nAnalysis finds that nursing homes where a higher share of residents are people of color are more likely to report a COVID-19 case. Studies also find disproportionate shares of infection among Hispanic and Black pregnant women and a higher risk of hospitalization among Black and Hispanic children. Data to understand variation in testing by race/ethnicity remains very limited but suggest people of color may face increased barriers to testing.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* Information 1, published on 2020-06-23, discusses a study in the Journal of Public Health that expresses concern over higher rates of poor COVID-19 outcomes in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.

The heightened public awareness about the dangers of unmitigated climate change make this an important moment for policymakers to enact bold reforms.\nWorse still, as COVID-19 hit, some policymakers were unwilling to acknowledge the danger until it was too late, ignoring the advice of public health experts and acting only after large human and economic costs were incurred. This surely begs the question: if it was difficult to react to a danger a few weeks away, then how will we be able to respond to a danger a few decades away?\nFirst, we need a strategy to overcome short-termism from the outset. Short termism is driven by fears of lost jobs and threatened livelihoods. The best way to defeat it is to communicate coherent and credible policies to ensure a “just transition.” If done right, mitigating climate change—with the use of carbon pricing—can help governments raise revenues that can then be used to create jobs and protect poorer households, which should help societies maintain a longer-term vision toward stopping climate change before it is too late.\nThe fast advances in solar panel technology and an 80 percent drop in prices over the past decade suggest that major progress can be achieved quickly if enough resources are committed. ...

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change calls for holding eventual warming “well below” two degrees Celsius, and for the pursuit of efforts to limit the increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. But if we don’t slow global emissions, temperatures could rise to above three degrees Celsius by 2100, causing further irreversible damage to our ecosystems.\nScalable new technologies and nature-based solutions will enable us all to leapfrog to a cleaner, more resilient world. If governments, businesses, civil society, youth, and academia work together, we can create a green future where suffering is diminished, justice is upheld, and harmony is restored between people and planet.\nGlobal warming is likely to make economic output between the world’s richest and poorest countries grow wider. Disasters linked to climate and weather extremes have always been part of our Earth’s system. But they are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms.\n90 per cent of disasters are now classed as weather- and climate-related, costing the world economy 520 billion USD each year, while 26 million people are pushed into poverty as a result. Climate change is a major threat to international peace and security. The effects of climate change heighten competition for resources such as land, food, and water, fueling socioeconomic tensions and, increasingly often, leading to mass displacement.

Combatting the coronavirus pandemic required each one of us to do our part, change our habits and daily routines and make personal sacrifices. If we can convince ourselves to do the same in the fight against the climate crisis, we will finally start to see real progress.\nThis year has been marked by the threat of a new coronavirus and society’s sacrifices to combat it – with a determination and political will that has been missing in the fight against climate change.

The data tells a different story.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-06-25\nTitle: Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge 'Only' Due to Testing, Misleads ...\nContent:\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\nWith some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up “only because of our big number testing,” and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate. In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!” · It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic.\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-06-23\nTitle: No, more testing doesn’t explain the rise of covid-19 cases in ...\nContent:\nThese days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. Case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April — from a peak of more than 10,000 cases per day to around 600 to 700 per day — although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. It is testing people with milder symptoms that may be due to covid-19, but could also be caused by other conditions.\nThese states have also made news for their rising covid-19 case numbers. Arizona had 14,107 cases last week, when it tested 67,235 people — up from 8,802 cases and 56,424 tests in the previous week At a glance, it may look as if Arizona found more cases last week because it tested more people, but the reality is that new cases outpace the spread of testing. In the last week, the incidence of new cases has increased in nearly half of the states.\nIgnoring the data is not a serious strategy: It is a threat to health and the economy. Covid ER visits rise: Covid-19, flu and RSV are rebounding in the United States ahead of the end-of-year holidays, with emergency room visits for the three respiratory viruses collectively reaching their highest levels since February. New coronavirus booster: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone 6 months or older get an updated coronavirus shot, but the vaccine rollout has seen some hiccups, especially for children.\nNo one thinks that anywhere near half the state’s population had covid-19 at that time, so those results would imply that testing was overly focused on a subset of the population highly likely to be infected. Indeed, health officials were limiting testing to health-care workers and patients requiring hospitalization. These days, upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent.

The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. These assertions are not backed up by the data, a ProPublica analysis shows. While it is true that there has been a dramatic increase in testing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the increase in positive cases in recent weeks cannot be attributed to the rise in testing alone.\nIn recent days, for instance, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, about 50% more than it was performing in the seven days leading up to Memorial Day. But only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus, indicating that community spread of the virus in the state has greatly decreased. To be sure, the virus exacted a tremendous toll on New York state and on New York City. Though COVID-19 now appears to be under control, more than 389,000 residents of New York state were infected and more than 24,700 died.\nThe Trump administration has doubled down on its claims that coronavirus case counts are up because the U.S. has increased testing.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\n\nInformation 1, published on an unspecified date, states that the rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. cannot be explained solely by increased testing. The article notes that the rate of positive tests is rising even faster than the number of tests being conducted, and that hospitalizations and deaths are also increasing. This information was published before the claim, which means it is relevant to the claim.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-11-19, also supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing. The article notes that the 7-day average percent positivity of tests in the U.S. has risen from 4.2% to 10% as of November 19, indicating that the virus is actually spreading more. This information was published after the claim, but it still provides evidence that the claim is true.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-06-25, states that scientists say it's premature to conclude that the current upticks in COVID-19 cases won't lead to increases in mortality later. The article also notes that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing. This information was published before the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-06-23, states that upward of 50,000 tests per day are conducted in New York and positivity is less than 2 percent. The article also notes that case numbers in New York have fallen considerably since April, although the state is now casting a wider net to look for infections. This information was published before the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-26, states that the assertions that the rise in COVID-19 cases is due to increased testing are not backed up by the data. The article notes that in recent days, New York has performed, on average, more than 64,000 tests, but only about 1% of those cases have been positive for the coronavirus. This information was published after the claim, and it supports the idea that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing.\n\nIn summary, the information provided supports the claim that the rise in COVID-19 cases is not solely due to increased testing. The claim is true. The evidence includes statements from experts, data on the rate of positive tests, and data on hospitalizations and deaths. Additionally, the evidence includes data on the percent positivity of tests in the U.S. and data on the number of cases and tests in New York. Overall, the evidence provides strong support for the claim.", "response": "FALSE."}

The president never called the coronavirus a hoax.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-03-02\nTitle: Timeline of Trump’s Coronavirus Responses | Congressman Lloyd ...\nContent:\n<strong>The</strong> <strong>Trump</strong> Administration disbands the White House pandemic response team · The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency left the post, and <strong>the</strong> <strong>Trump</strong> Administration eliminated the role\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-03-16\nTitle: What Trump Says About the Coronavirus Threat - The Atlantic\nContent:\nFrom the moment the coronavirus reached the United States, President Donald Trump has seemed determined to construct an alternate reality around the outbreak. In the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements.\nA key strain of the president’s narrative is that concerns about the coronavirus are being weaponized by bad-faith actors—a notion that has spawned a broad range of conspiracy theories. On Fox Business, Trish Regan accused Trump’s enemies of trying to “create mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off” that would harm his reelection prospects: “This is impeachment all over again,” she declared. Rush Limbaugh has mused that the president is the target of “virus terrorism.” And on Facebook and Twitter, a meme has begun circulating among Trump fans that darkly suggests a new disease is introduced every election year to influence politics.\nIn the information universe he has formed, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is no worse than the seasonal flu; criticism of his response to it is a “hoax”; and media coverage of the virus is part of a political conspiracy to destroy his presidency. As with so much of the president’s messaging, this narrative began with tossed-off tweets and impromptu public statements. But in recent days, as U.S. health officials have raised growing concerns about the outbreak, Trump’s efforts to play down the pandemic have been amplified by the same multi-platform propaganda apparatus he’s relying on for reelection in November.\nScholars who study modern disinformation tactics have identified this approach as “censorship through noise.” (Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist, has described the strategy in blunter terms: “Flood the zone with shit.”) As I reported in my recent feature on the Trump campaign, the purpose of this sort of propaganda blizzard is not to inspire conviction in a certain set of facts; it’s to bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts, and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion. Read: The billion-dollar disinformation campaign to reelect the president · Spend some time wading through the coronavirus content that’s spreading through the MAGA ecosystem, and it’s easy to see the strategy at work. Trump supporters have been warned incessantly not to trust mainstream journalistic coverage of the issue.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-02, is an article from Snopes investigating whether President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a 'hoax'. The article explains that during a campaign rally in South Carolina on Feb 28, 2020, President Trump accused Democrats of politicizing the coronavirus outbreak and called it \"their new hoax\", but did not specifically call the virus itself a hoax.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not specified, is a press release from the Trump Campaign, which includes quotes from Snopes, Lead Stories, and The Washington Post, all stating that President Trump did not call the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that \"President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy\" is mostly false. While President Trump did use the term \"hoax\" in relation to the coronavirus, it was in the context of the Democrats' politicization of the virus, not the virus itself. This is supported by Information 1, which was published shortly after the event in question and provides a detailed analysis of President Trump's comments.\n\nInformation 3, a press release from the Trump Campaign, also supports this conclusion by quoting several reputable fact-checking organizations that have debunked the claim that President Trump called the coronavirus a hoax.\n\nTherefore, the claim that President Trump referred to the coronavirus as a hoax or political conspiracy is mostly false, as he specifically referred to the Democrats' politicization of the virus as a hoax, not the virus itself.", "response": "FALSE."}

At the same time, the vaccines are intended to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, or at least severe or fatal COVID-19 infections. So far, four COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), all encoding the spike protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSummary of the given information:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 11, 2020, by PolitiFact, is a fact-check article debunking the claim that autopsies prove COVID-19 is a blood clot and should be fought with antibiotics. The article explains that COVID-19 is a viral infection, and antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Autopsies in Italy revealed that blood clotting is an additional effect of COVID-19, causing lung damage.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 1, 2020, by FactCheck.org, supports Information 1, emphasizing that COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not bacteria, and antibiotics have no effect on the virus.\n\nInformation 3 is a reproduction of the fact-check article from PolitiFact, confirming the information provided in 1 and 2.\n\nInformation 4, although the publication date is not provided, discusses the autopsy findings and venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19.

This information is not related to the claim about COVID-19 being a blood clot or the treatment of the disease.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is:\n\nFALSE\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim states that autopsies prove COVID-19 is a blood clot and should be fought with antibiotics. However, multiple credible sources (Information 1, 2, and 3) have debunked this claim, stating that COVID-19 is a viral infection, and antibiotics have no effect on the virus. Autopsies have shown that blood clotting is an additional effect of COVID-19, but this does not mean that the disease itself is a blood clot. Therefore, the claim is false.", "response": "FALSE."}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (here), “there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe NIH also says that zinc “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses” (here). However, milk does not contain a significant amount of vitamin C or zinc. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lists foods and their nutrients in a database.\nThe British Nutrition Foundation states here , “No food or supplement, can protect you from getting the coronavirus (COVID-19). Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body’s ability to fight infection.” · It is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body’s immune system. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “vitamin C improves the absorption of iron from plant-based foods and helps the immune system work properly to protect the body from disease” (here).\nMark Pochapin (here), a gastroenterologist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, said he did not think there was “really any significant health benefit to lactoferrin.” Like the CDC and the WHO, Dr. Pochapin advised that people “just be meticulous” about washing their hands, avoid touching their face, and keep social distancing. ... Partly false: No food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus, although milk can form part of a healthy diet that will support immune function.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-02-08\nTitle: Can Mother’s Milk Help Fight COVID?

The coronaviruses were initially classified according to their antigenic characteristics into three serological groups (1), known as Groups 1, 2, and 3, which were later renamed as the new genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively (2).\nSince there is currently no specific treatment for severe cases, it is critical to find immune mechanisms and strategies to help control the disease. We propose the use of heterologous passive immunity using Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\nWe think that the presence of specific IgG in the intestinal lumen would help control viral excretion. Passive immunity conferred through breast milk has a remarkable protective effect against most of the infectious diseases of animals and has been well studied in almost all coronaviruses of veterinary concern (47–49).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on March 31, 2020, by Reuters, discusses a post by \"The Bullvine\" claiming that milk can help prevent or fight off COVID-19 due to lactoferrin, vitamin C, and zinc. The article clarifies that this claim is misleading, as milk does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc. While vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the immune system, no food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus. However, having a healthy diet can support immune function.\n\nInformation 2, published on February 8, 2021, discusses a study by the University of Rochester Medical Center, revealing that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk.\n\nInformation 3, with no specific publication date, is a study on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in milk. The study found that pasteurization effectively eliminates infectious virus titers in milk.\n\nInformation 4, published on September 28, 2020, states that Chinese researchers found that exposure to human breast milk helps kill the virus that causes Covid-19. The World Health Organization recommends mothers continue breastfeeding even if they have COVID-19.\n\nInformation 5, with no specific publication date, proposes the use of Bovine Coronavirus immune milk (BIM) as an immunostimulant therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to activate the intestinal immune system.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that milk helps fighting the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not accurate. According to the information provided, there is no evidence that milk can prevent or fight off COVID-19. While milk contains lactoferrin, it does not contain significant amounts of vitamin C or zinc, which are important for immune function. Furthermore, a healthy diet supports immune function but does not prevent COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2 and 4 suggest that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the virus through their milk, and human breast milk may help kill the virus that causes Covid-19.

The focus was on promoting production, stabilizing currencies, and promoting international trade. To be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid.\nTo be eligible for the aid, a country had to sign an agreement with the United States government committing itself to the Act's purposes. The Communist countries were formally invited to participate in the Plan although Secretary Marshall thought it unlikely that they would accept and they did in fact decline the aid. Also in 1948, the United States and the recipient countries created the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC – it became the OECD in 1961) to coordinate the use of the aid.\nUnited States foreign aid, also known as US foreign assistance consists of a variety of tangible and intangible forms of assistance the United States gives to other countries. Foreign aid is used to support American national security and commercial interests and can also be distributed for humanitarian reasons. Aid is financed from US taxpayers and other revenue sources that Congress appropriates annually through the United States budget process. It is dispersed through \"over 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs,\" although about half of all economic assistance is channeled through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nAlthough formally the material was loaned, in the end only partial repayment was demanded. A second wartime aid program, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was founded in November 1943, by 44 Allied governments, for the purpose of assisting and resettling displaced victims of the war.\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-07-08, discusses the Portuguese government's inability to provide guidance to local authorities regarding the sharing of personal data of protesters by Lisbon City Council.

Although vaccination does provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection, these findings suggest that COVID-19 can cause long-term damage to the immune system and make someone less able to fight off reinfection.\nT cells are an important part of the immune system. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines give these cells information about SARS-CoV-2 so that they can attack the virus and any infected cells to keep the infection from spreading. T cells can also alert B cells, which produce antibodies against the virus.\nThese findings suggest that COVID-19 causes long-term damage to the immune system, even after recovery and vaccination against COVID-19. Future research can examine how to strengthen T cells to better protect people who have previously gotten sick. However, no matter whether a person is vaccinated before or after they get COVID-19, vaccination against future cases of COVID-19 will still provoke a stronger immune response than the response of unvaccinated people.\nPeople who were vaccinated but had contracted COVID-19 before their vaccination had a lower number of CD8+ T cells, and people who had never been vaccinated had the lowest amount. The T cells in those two groups were also less able to recruit B cells to fight future infections. These findings suggest that COVID-19 causes long-term damage to the immune system, even after recovery and vaccination against COVID-19.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2022-06-05\nTitle: Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them ...\nContent:\nIt has been hypothesized that there will be an increase in cardiovascular diseases, especially acute coronary syndromes, caused by the spike proteins in genetic vaccines [18, 19]. Besides the risk of infections owing to lowered immune functions, there is a possible risk of unknown organ damage caused by the vaccine that has remained hidden without apparent clinical presentations, mainly in the circulatory system. Therefore, careful risk assessments prior to surgery and invasive medical procedures are essential. Randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm these clinical observations. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients.\nRecently, The Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.\nThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals. According to European Medicines Agency recommendations, frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible.\nThe decrease in immunity can be caused by several factors such as N1-methylpseudouridine, the spike protein, lipid nanoparticles, antibody-dependent enhancement, and the original antigenic stimulus. These clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: 5 Things You Should Know about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nWe have multiple years of experience showing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the strains of virus causing most of the disease change and immunity wanes over time. The changes from last year’s vaccines are small, but they help make the vaccine better at targeting the virus strains circulating now and give your immune system a boost.\nBottom line: CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against potentially serious COVID-19 outcomes this fall and winter. This is especially important for older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who are at highest risk for severe illness.\nThe virus is constantly changing, and our immunity, whether from vaccines or previous infections, fades. Getting updated vaccines like the updated COVID-19 vaccines that are available now continues to be important, especially for older people and those with certain medical conditions.\nImmune protection from both vaccines and previous infections can decline over time and as new variants emerge. It is important to stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, especially for people at higher risk of severe disease, such as older adults and people with medical conditions.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change.

After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA.

Early studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys.\nEarly studies show that a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is highly effective in rhesus macaque monkeys. Developing a safe and effective vaccine is central to stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. While emergency measures that authorities put in place to promote physical distancing and protect those most at risk have been important in slowing the spread of the virus, given its virulence, the resulting reduction in transmission rates is likely to be temporary.\nRecently, a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown promise, with its developers demonstrating that it is highly effective in protecting rhesus macaque monkeys from developing the disease.\nFortunately, according to the authors of a recent review article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, “unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts” between global institutions has meant that time estimates for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine are down from the usual 10 or more years to about 12–18 months.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 | Nature\nContent:\nAdditional macaques received saline (control (C), n = 9)). Human convalescent sera (HCS) were obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 d after PCR-confirmed diagnosis and at a time when acute COVID-19 symptoms had resolved (n = 38). The HCS panel is a benchmark for serology studies in this Article and previous publications1,2,3. a, Concentrations (in arbitrary units) of IgG that binds recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (lower limit of detection (LLOD) = 1.72 U ml−1). b, SARS-CoV-2 50% virus-neutralization titres (VNT50) (LLOD = 20). c, d, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on days 0, 14, 28 and 42 after first injection of BNT162b2 were restimulated ex vivo with full-length S peptide mix.\nThe histopathology of necropsy specimens obtained 7–8 days after challenge revealed localized areas of pulmonary inflammation that were limited in extent even in the control macaques challenged after mock immunization with saline (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae.\nWe conclude that the 2–4-year-old male-macaque challenge model is primarily a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather a model than of COVID-19 diseae. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccines BNT162b1 or BNT162b2—lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode secreted, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or prefusion-stabilized S, respectively—induce strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice and macaques.\nTherefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19 vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses. Both candidates protected 2–4-year-old macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2, and there was reduced detection of viral RNA in immunized macaques as compared to those that received saline.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-12-01\nTitle: The Monkeys Behind COVID-19 Vaccines - NPRC\nContent:\nThe researchers also conducted detailed genetic studies on the virus to help pharmaceutical researchers use pieces of the virus’ genetic code to fashion vaccine candidates and test them for safety and effectiveness in macaques.

This is in line with the information presented in Information 1 and 2, both of which report on studies showing that COVID-19 vaccine candidates are effective in protecting rhesus macaques from the virus. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely true.\n\nIt is worth noting that the studies reported in Information 1 and 2 were conducted in the early stages of COVID-19 vaccine development, and the vaccines have since undergone further testing and have been shown to be effective in humans as well.

Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market.\nAdded to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.\nChina has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia.

The study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd. They have worries about one or more routine vaccines, and question whether the benefits for their child are worthwhile. Even though those parents are not \"adamantly\" opposed to vaccinations, it can still be hard for paediatricians to allay their concerns, said Jason Glanz, lead researcher on the study.\nThe study involved \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents – a group distinct from the staunch \"anti-vaxxer\" crowd.

Parents who received the information were no more likely to have their babies up to date on vaccinations than other parents were, the study found.\nRoutine childhood vaccines have a long history of safe use, Glanz said, but some parents have questions. They may have heard that certain ingredients in vaccines are not safe, or worry that their baby is being given \"too many\" immunisations in a short time. And during a busy paediatrician visit, Glanz said, it can be hard to address all those questions.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Encountering Parents Who Are Hesitant or Reluctant to Vaccinate ...\nContent:\nThis lack of recognition of vaccinating professionals, particularly nurses, was reflected in the lack of decision-making power regarding changes in vaccination programs. Their opinion was hardly recognised or considered, despite the fact that they were the ones who in most cases faced parents opposed to vaccination [35,38,40].\nThis metaphor, accompanied by three themes, symbolises the care experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who hesitate or refuse to vaccinate their children. In the metaphor, healthcare professionals are represented as sculptors and parents as the stones to be sculpted. The sculpting process is necessary to achieve a common good and a low-risk environment for society. The first theme, stone hardness, symbolizes the degree of deep-rootedness of the parents’ decision not to vaccinate.\nTable 5 shows the results of the findings assessment with the CERQual tool [47]. Stone hardness (resistance to vaccination) showed high confidence, while lack of modelling tools (lack of resources, support and training) and Rudimentary sculpting (using personal strategies) presented moderate confidence. This means that it is likely that they reasonably represent the experiences of health professionals in their encounters with parents who are hesitant or opposed to the vaccination of their children.\nThe influence of pharmaceutical companies and the existence of economic interests also contributed to hesitant parents justifying their decision of non-vaccination, since the information brochures were sometimes sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies [33]. The frequent changes in vaccination programs were related to the influence of pharmaceutical companies, generating mistrust among parents [38]. Healthcare professionals often lacked the resources, support, and training to deal with hesitancy or rejection of immunisation.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1: This study, published in 2020, analyzed 90 articles on vaccine hesitancy in the United States to determine the reasons behind vaccine-hesitant parents and potential interventions.

There are many things, like taking warm baths, getting plenty of rest, or eating and drinking honey, lemon, tea, ginger, and other foods that may help people feel better when they are sick. However, there is no clear evidence that these foods/drinks are reliable home remedies to cure an illness or infection.\nHealth experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that tea will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\nHot Khaada (or kadha or karha): Khaada is a drink often made with a combination of herbs, spices, and other additives that may include cloves, black pepper, ginger, basil, cardamom, fennel seeds, honey, ghee, amongst others.

Teas of native species, especially Achyrocline alata (Kunth) DC., have also been employed. Steam mixtures of these species are being used in “disinfection chambers” at the entrances of public markets, demonstrating great ignorance of the correct application of these species for the prevention of COVID-19. The consumption of onions, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger, and turmeric to strengthen the immune system during the pandemic has recently been promoted in many social networks.\nFinally, the fruits of Celtis tournefortii Lam. were fried, crushed and powdered, and prepared in a mixture with honey or molasses, which is eaten to boost the immune system. Pashtuns in this area live in close contact with nature and have thus utilized plants and other natural products during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was experienced, observed, and heard that not only the use of certain vegetables and fruits considered beneficial increased significantly during the pandemic, i.e., lemon, banana, ginger, garlic, onion, cucumber, apple, peach, cherry, plum, apricot, and date, but that their demand and prices increased in the market as well.\nThe most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon. Our preliminary inventory of food medicines serves as a baseline for future systematic ethnobotanical studies and aims to inspire in-depth research on how use patterns of plant-based foods and beverages, both “traditional” and “new”, are changing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020), a botánica (shop selling Caribbean remedies for health and wellbeing) in the Bronx reported selling much greater volumes online of eucalyptus, chamomile, and anamú (Petiveria alliacea L.), to treat COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, fever, and trouble breathing, together with other plants that allegedly ease anxiety.

Email to FactCheck.org. 30 July 2020.\nAs Florida’s COVID-19 case count rose to the second-highest in the U.S. in July, a former challenger for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat falsely claimed on social media that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had made a \"mistake\" and subsequently reduced Florida's count by 79,000 cases.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-03-13\nTitle: Home - Florida Department of Health COVID-19\nContent:\nWhat you need to know now about <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Florida</strong> · <strong>Florida</strong> <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> Data · Now posted weekly on CHARTS, alongside all other public health data · Charts Dashboard · Find <strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong> resource sites near you · Search Now · Follow @HealthyFla Tweets by HealthyFla · No priorities set\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-07-31\nTitle: PolitiFact: No, CDC did not admit a mistake, did not reduce its ...\nContent:\nThe Centers for Disease Control did not admit any kind of systematic error in its Florida COVID-19 counts. The Trump administration on July 10 did order hospitals to bypass the CDC and send COVID-19 patient information to the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump administration officials say the change will streamline data gathering, but the HHS database is not open to the public, which could affect the work of health officials who relied on the CDC database, the New York Times reported.\nIn a reply to her tweet, Lorraine cited what she said were the “sources” for her claim, including: a report that a Florida motorcyclist’s death had been added to the COVID-19 and then was removed; a partially debunked claim that hospitals are paid $13,000 for the admission of a COVID-19 patient and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator; and her own statement that the CDC has admitted that it includes pneumonia and seasonal flu in its count of COVID-19 cases. Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that similar claims were made in June. “The claim was false then and is still false now. I’m not even sure where those numbers come from. They seem to have been pulled out of thin air,” he said. As of Monday, the day we published this fact-check, Florida had nearly 419,000 cases, according to the CDC.\nBob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that similar claims were made in June. “The claim was false then and is still false now.

But there is no record such a video was ever posted on Twitter by Pelosi. At an April 13 coronavirus briefing, Trump falsely claimed that during her visit Pelosi said, “‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.'” Pelosi didn’t say that.\nSo, Pelosi mentioned the Chinese New Year parade. But she did not say, “‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade,'” as Trump maintained during the April 13 coronavirus briefing. In fact, the parade occurred on Feb. 8. And, while she encouraged people to “visit and enjoy Chinatown” and called it “very safe,” Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi “was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.” Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit.\nAt an April 13 coronavirus briefing, Trump falsely claimed that during her visit Pelosi said, “‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.'” Pelosi didn’t say that.

But critics of the top Democratic lawmaker have pointed out that she encouraged people to visit Chinatown in San Francisco as fears of the novel coronavirus grew in late February.\nA few commentators on the right then pointed out that Pelosi had encouraged people to visit Chinatown amid rising fears of the coronavirus toward the end of February. \"Was this the message you went to spread in Chinatown back in February when this was spreading unchecked?\" the Republican congressional candidate David Dudenhoefer tweeted at Pelosi. During her trip to Chinatown broadcast by CBS SF Bay Area, Pelosi told reporters: \"It's exciting to be here, especially at this time, to be able to be unified with our community.\n\"The President's own words spell out the devastating truth: Trump was fully aware of the catastrophic nature of the coronavirus but hid the facts and refused to take the threat seriously, leaving our entire country exposed and unprepared,\" said another tweet.

She visited Chinatown on February 24 and encouraged people to visit Chinatown to support local businesses. The Chinese New Year parade had already taken place on February 8.\n\nInformation 2, published on September 10, 2020, discusses Pelosi's criticism of Trump for downplaying the COVID-19 threat. Critics have pointed out that Pelosi encouraged people to visit Chinatown in late February. Pelosi visited Chinatown to send a message that there is no reason to avoid the area due to coronavirus concerns and to end discrimination against the Asian-American community.\n\nInformation 3, published on April 23, 2020, by The Washington Post, discusses Trump's exaggeration of Pelosi's visit to Chinatown.

She did not encourage people to have a big parade or street party, as Trump claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true and partially false.

This study determines the role of two saline regimens on symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Between 2020 and 2022, individuals aged 18-65 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomly allocated to low- or high-saline regimens for 14 days. Low- and high-saline solutions consisted of 2.13 grams and 6 grams of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water, respectively.\nMethods: Between 2020 and 2022, individuals aged 18-65 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomly allocated to low- or high-saline regimens for 14 days. Low- and high-saline solutions consisted of 2.13 grams and 6 grams of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water, respectively.

Gargling and nasal rinsing was done four times a day for 14 days. Primary outcomes included frequency and duration of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; secondary outcomes included hospital or ICU admission, mechanical ventilatory support, or death.\nConclusion: 1) Low- and high- saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing are associated with similar frequency and duration of symptoms related with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2) Both saline regimens appear to be associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

There is currently “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” according to the World Health Organization. It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus.\nOne of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-03-17, is a fact-check by Reuters discussing a social media claim that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar eliminates the coronavirus. The claim states that the coronavirus remains in the throat for four days before reaching the lungs and that gargling with salt or vinegar can eliminate the virus. Reuters found no official government or medical advisory recommending the use of saline or vinegar to eliminate the virus.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by 15min.lt stating that there is no proof that salt and/or vinegar can kill the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not provided, is a study discussing the effectiveness of various gargle formulations, including salt water, against SARS-CoV-2. The study found that salt water was not proven effective. However, gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine, and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SARS-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2023-11-07, is a study discussing the role of saline regimens on symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2. The study found that both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-03-16, is a fact-check by FactCheck.org stating that gargling water with salt or vinegar does not eliminate the coronavirus.\n\nClaim: Publication date: 2020-03-16, Content: Gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar kills SARS-CoV-2.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nAccording to Information 1, 2, and 5, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that gargling warm water with salt and/or vinegar eliminates or kills SARS-CoV-2. Information 3 also states that salt water was not proven effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, Information 4 discusses a study that found both low- and high-saline regimens for gargling and nasal rinsing were associated with lower hospitalization rates compared to controls in SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study does not support the claim that gargling with salt water kills the virus. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.", "response": "FALSE."}

In particular, two areas deserve closer examination of SIV infections in natural hosts.\nSince the advent of rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests over the past 15 years, most diagnostic laboratories have stopped attempting to diagnose C. trachomatis infections by isolation and these skills are rapidly becoming a “lost art.” The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) holds a small collection of isolates that cover all of the genital tract serotypes, and it is mainly these strains, chosen for their ability to grow well in the laboratory, that have been the focus of laboratory-based studies. From limited phylogenetic studies, using either fragments of the chromosome or using whole genomes, it is clear that C. trachomatis can be divided into two distinctive groupings.\nIt is important to remember that gonococci have spent thousands of years infecting humans, and over the millennia the bacterium has adapted itself for survival; hence, its capacity to develop resistance to antimicrobials used clinically to treat infections should not be surprising. In relationship to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, several important issues need to be considered. First, both gene (whole or parts of a gene) acquisition and spontaneous mutation events (high mutational rate in some resistance genes), which are effectively selected due to antibiotic pressure in the society, are responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonococci.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 4 all discuss a fake World Health Organization (WHO) poster that advises people to \"avoid unprotected sex with wild or farm animals\" to prevent coronavirus infection.

No country has experienced as devastating a wave of COVID-19 infections as India is now. It set a new record for single-day infections last week, overtaking the United States, and it accounts for almost half of new cases worldwide. Experts say a combination of factors gave rise to the explosion in cases: new variants of the virus, including one first detected in India, that are thought to be more transmissible; a weak government response; and large public gatherings.\nThe average deaths per day are nearing 2,500, and the number continues to climb, pushing cremation facilities and cemeteries past their limits. Overall, the Indian government has reported around 195,000 deaths from COVID-19, but analysts say the total is likely much greater.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Edge of crisis: When kids suffer from COVID-19 - Down To Earth\nContent:\nWith children reporting severe post-COVID-19 symptoms, India must prioritise its paediatric infrastructure ...

Even after four days of care, the fever persisted and the family from Surat, Gujarat, took the infant to his paediatrician. Kiyant’s doctor, Ketan Shah, after initial examination, warned the family that he might be suffering from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C, a serious condition that appears to be linked to infectious diseases like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe condition is rare and 12 out of 10,000 infected children experience it, according to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, an association of doctors. It usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from COVID-19, suggest the “Guidelines on Operationalization of COVID Care Services for Children & Adolescents”, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in June 2021.\nWhile the proportion of children getting infected by COVID-19 is still not frightening, it is significant enough to establish that children are not as immune to post-COVID-19 complications as thought.

We will also continue to engage with Note Circulation Scheme members and ATM operators to get an up-to-date view on customer demand for banknotes. We will continue to hold interviews with a range of large retailers to learn more about their cash holdings, the cash trends they are seeing and their attitudes to cash acceptance.\n2022 also saw travel disruptions, often due to staff shortages in the travel industry, which may be discouraging people from taking holidays overseas. Restrictions on international travel could be disrupting cross-border cash movements. In particular, it could be disrupting cash spending from tourism, suggesting that overseas demand for banknotes, at least in the earlier days of the pandemic, would be mostly to hold in reserve. The future path of banknote demand remains uncertain, and will depend both on changes in cash’s store of value role as well as cash’s use for transactions.\nQuarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Cash in the time of Covid | Bank of England\nContent:\nOnce banknotes have been printed, they are sold by the Bank of England to the members of the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS).footnote [15] NCS members then supply banknotes to (and collect banknotes from) their major customers, primarily banks, ATM operators and merchants. These notes are acquired by the public and either spent or saved as a store of value. Retailers and banks will return excess notes to the NCS, at which point they are sorted to ensure they are genuine and in good condition, and recirculated.footnote [16], footnote [17] The constant flow of banknotes around the system means that banknotes are used many times without necessitating an overall increase in the number in circulation.\nTherefore, the recent increase in demand suggests there has been a change in behaviour at one or more points in the system (Table A), and that banknotes are being held somewhere — among retailers, financial institutions, ATMs, or the public — and not returned to the NCS as usual. In other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area.\nIn other words, banknotes are circulating less frequently, as demonstrated by the weak recovery in the flow of banknotes into NCS cash centres and out of circulation (Chart 4). Below we present some explanations for the changes in cash demand. We will continue to develop our analysis in this area. First, people could be holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began. This is for contingency reasons, in line with cash’s established role as an emergency means of payment; a survey by the ATM network LINK in April found that 14% of respondents were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies.\nShops will then have re-cashed as they prepared for reopening. Overall, however, this is likely to have had a small effect in aggregate and been outweighed by other behaviour. Similarly, it is possible that a combination of banks, post offices and ATM operators are holding more cash than usual at present. Banks typically prepare for an incident such as a pandemic by ensuring that branches, cash centres and ATMs are fully stocked with banknotes.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Nigerian plan to switch currency delayed after shortage of new ...\nContent:\nA plan by the Nigerian government to switch from the old banknotes of its currency, the naira, to new banknotes with a different color and more security features was put on hold by the country’s Supreme Court Wednesday.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-02-09\nTitle: New Naira notes: Nigeria delays plans to replace its banknotes ...\nContent:\nThe CBN assures that “queues at ATMs will disappear soon” while directing commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter, however, “subject to a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).” · President Buhari said he was “aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the naira redesign,” but assured Nigerians of “significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline.”\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2023-03-27\nTitle: Nigeria Dispenses Banknotes to End Three-Month Cash Crunch - Bloomberg\nContent:\nCustomers waited to withdraw newly designed Nigerian naira banknotes from ATMs in Februrary.Photographer: Benson Ibeabuchi/Bloomberg ... Nigeria’s central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January.\n\nSummary of Information:\n\nInformation 1: The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2022 Q3 discusses the value of banknotes held in the transactional cycle and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on cash demand. The analysis suggests that the recent increase in demand for banknotes is due to changes in behavior and banknotes being held somewhere in the system, resulting in less frequent circulation.\n\nInformation 2: The Bank of England's article \"Cash in the time of Covid\" explains the process of banknote circulation, from the Bank of England selling banknotes to the Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) members to the public spending or saving cash. The recent increase in demand for banknotes indicates a change in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the Covid crisis began, and banks, post offices, and ATM operators possibly holding more cash than usual.\n\nInformation 3: A Nigerian government plan to switch from old to new banknotes was delayed by the country's Supreme Court due to a shortage of new banknotes.\n\nInformation 4: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured Nigerians of significant improvements in cash shortages and hardship due to the naira redesign by February 10, 2023, and directed commercial banks to pay the new notes over the counter with a maximum daily payout limit of N20,000 ($43).\n\nInformation 5: Nigeria's central bank increased the supply of banknotes to lenders to end shortages that have hampered individual and business transactions and crippled the cash-based economy since January 2023.\n\nJudgment of Claim:\n\nThe claim that a lockdown will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs is partially supported by the information provided. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in behavior, with people holding more cash than before the crisis began (Information 1 and 2). This change in behavior could lead to a shortage of banknotes in ATMs if the demand for cash exceeds the supply. However, the information does not explicitly state that lockdowns will cause a shortage of banknotes in ATMs.\n\nConsidering the timeline of the information, Information 1 and 2 predate the claim, while Information 3, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. However, the possibility of a shortage of banknotes in ATMs due to the increased demand for cash during the pandemic cannot be ruled out.", "response": "FALSE."}

Scientists are scrambling to find treatments and vaccines for the virus, which causes the illness Covid-19, and health care professionals are working to stop the spread of misinformation.

COVID-19: Researchers Launch Study to Lessen ...\nContent:\nThe trial is based on research the authors published in the Journal of Global Health March 29 entitled, “Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19.” They cited tests showing that DNA- and RNA-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses – specifically herpes simplex virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 – were inhibited by chloride ions in salt.\nIn reexamining data from the 2019 study, Edinburgh researchers found the benefits of salt water gargle and nasal irrigation also were experienced by participants who were infected with one of the four common coronavirus strains that cause colds. Therefore, the suspect the benefits may also extend to COVID-19 patients.\nOf the initial group of 68 who were accepted for the trial, 56% were infected with rhinovirus and 31% with coronaviruses. The remainder were infected with enterovirus, influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. A total of 54 individuals completed the controlled trial. The control group treated the cold as they normally would. The other group was asked to do a salt water gargle and rinse their nasal passages with a salt solution at will.\nSalt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-11-07\nTitle: New Study: Gargling with Salt Water May Help Prevent Covid ...\nContent:\nIntroduction: Saline nasal irrigation and gargling improve respiratory symptoms associated with coronavirus infection.

Subsequent social isolation due to stay-at-home orders detrimentally impacted client’s mental status because of the choice between staying home, which could exacerbate depression, or risking exposure by connecting with community. One provider shared, “if you have a serious mental illness, [isolation] seems to magnify whatever illness that person struggles with—depression, anxiety, psychosis—isolation is really detrimental.” For clients who had SMI, providers indicated paranoia as a common experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough vaccination and mitigation strategies will eventually curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of asking people to remain in isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern [6]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported globally [7,8]. A systematic, rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine found that pandemic-related stressors might have long-lasting effects on well-being [9]. Social isolation, as a result of recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies, has been associated with exacerbation of mental health challenges and overdose deaths [10,11,12]. People with SUD have disproportionately elevated rates of mental health challenges; those with a previous mental health diagnosis reported greater exacerbations of psychological symptoms during the pandemic than those who did not report previous diagnoses [12,13].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness amidst social isolation. This finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH.\nThis finding is supported by previous research that COVID-19 mitigation measures, and subsequent effects of those measures including social isolation, may lead to mental health symptoms, loneliness, and psychological trauma [17]. Furthermore, the compounded stress of homelessness during the pandemic further contributed to worsening mental health symptoms with increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression for PEH. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Frontiers | Psychological Consequences of Social Isolation During ...\nContent:\nThe most common psychological disorders emerging are anxiety and panic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insomnia, digestive problems, as well as depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (Rogers et al., 2020). These are not only a direct consequence of the pandemic but also largely driven by the effects of prolonged social isolation – that is the objective lack of interactions with others (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017).\nAs the reality of social isolation persists throughout and beyond the pandemic, loneliness and interpersonal disconnection will emerge, particularly for those most socially vulnerable. Psychophysical exhaustion, anxiety, fear and pain, anguish, trauma, and anger – these emotions alternate, mix, and grow in intensity to the point of overwhelm, leading to clinically significant psychological disorders, such as “reactive depression.”\nChina has experienced a significant rise in separations and divorces, particularly stressful events, which can act as a trigger – especially among the most sensitive – for the development of mental health problems, primarily depression. On the other hand, prolonged social isolation characterized by reduced social connections and contact, generates deep disconnection among those who live alone or cannot rely on an adequate social network, thus increasing the likelihood that depressive symptoms will emerge.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Isolation During Pandemic a Trigger for Depression - WebMD\nContent:\nCOVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.

Linked to this were constraints on people’s ability to work, seek support from loved ones and engage in their communities. Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression.

Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking. ... The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During ...\nContent:\nThere was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.\nWith unprecedented population aging; the consequences of social isolation on the mental wellbeing of older people is emerging as a significant public health concern, now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Previous studies have reported that social disconnection puts older people at greater risk of depression and anxiety (3).\nThey reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population during the pandemic as 33% (28%–30%) and 28% (23%–32%), respectively. Common risk factors for higher psychological impact included being female, having contracted COVID-19, lower socio-economic status, social isolation and spending longer watching COVID-19 related news.\nAlthough no study has yet investigated the associations of smoking and alcohol with risk for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has been reportedly associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors, including increased smoking and alcohol consumption (35).\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published without a specific date, is a report on the impact of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. It highlights increased rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the pandemic and social isolation. The impact is more severe for people with pre-existing mental health conditions and substance use disorders. Social isolation has also worsened mental health symptoms for homeless individuals.\n\nInformation 2, also without a specific date, focuses on the psychological consequences of social isolation during the pandemic.

In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems.\nSome people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells.\nThe loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different—even sometimes unpleasant or foul—than people remember prior to being infected.\nThis can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2013-08-06\nTitle: Permanent Nerve Damage for Some COVID-19 Survivors\nContent:\nMany COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.

This is similar to the claim, but it doesn't mention if the damage is permanent.\n\nInformation 2, from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explains that COVID-19 symptoms are a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection, and this response can damage body systems. It also mentions that some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, which can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. This information suggests that the damage to nerve cells is not necessarily permanent.\n\nInformation 3, published in 2013, discusses COVID-19 complications that may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.

However, this damage is potentially treatable and may not be permanent, as the nerve cells can repair themselves or be replaced by new cells. Therefore, the claim \"Permanent Nerve Damage for Some COVID-19 Survivors\" needs to be clarified to specify that the nerve damage may not be permanent.", "response": "TRUE."}

To put a knife up to your son’s throat is child abuse. I Kings 3:24-25 “And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.” This test was of course given to see who the real mother of the child was.\nAnd the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.” This test was of course given to see who the real mother of the child was.

Coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses named for the crown-like spikes on the virus. SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses, but many of these viruses cause illnesses like the common cold.\nSome Lysol and Clorox products are already proven to fight some strains of coronaviruses. This year’s Novel Coronavirus, otherwise labeled 2019-ncov, hasn’t been around long enough for companies to test the effectiveness of sprays or wipes. Much of how the virus spreads remains unknown, which contributes to public concerns about the epidemic as cases top 20,000 in China.\nSome corners of the Internet are crafting conspiracy theories, claiming that America knew about the coronavirus before it was publicized, and that’s why the companies are able to list the virus on their packaging. It’s important to keep in mind when searching for information online that this year’s coronavirus is not the only one out there.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-02-27, explains that Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels that mention the \"Human Coronavirus.\" However, these labels refer to previously identified strains of the human coronavirus, not the new strain behind the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos are misleading by suggesting that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2020-01-31, discusses false claims on social media that Clorox and Lysol already knew about the new coronavirus. These claims arise from disinfectant product labels listing \"Human Coronavirus,\" which has led to confusion about the different strains of the virus.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-03-06, reiterates the previous information that disinfectant products were tested against a strain of coronavirus that causes the common cold, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nInformation 4, published on 2020-03-13, provides a list of disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), but it does not mention Lysol or Clorox products specifically.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-02-05, clarifies that some Lysol and Clorox products can fight some strains of coronaviruses, but they have not specifically tested their products against the new 2019-nCoV strain.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that a bottle of disinfectant from 2015 shows coronavirus, suggesting that the virus is not new, is not entirely accurate. According to the provided information, Lysol and other disinfectant products have labels mentioning \"Human Coronavirus,\" but they refer to previously identified strains, not the new strain responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media videos have misleadingly suggested that the latest strain was previously known to science.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially false, as it incorrectly implies that the label on the 2015 disinfectant bottle refers to the new COVID-19 strain. It is crucial to understand that the \"Human Coronavirus\" mentioned on disinfectant product labels refers to previously identified strains, not the new strain that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "FALSE."}

Therefore, we cannot use the information to confirm or deny the claim directly due to the sequential relationship between the dates.\n\nHowever, the claim can still be evaluated based on general knowledge and principles. Reducing pensions for current retirees is an extraordinary measure that would likely face significant opposition and legal challenges. Moreover, the Indian government has other ways to allocate funds, such as reallocating the budget or raising taxes, rather than reducing pensions.\n\nConsidering this, it seems unlikely that the Indian government would reduce employees' pensions by 30% and terminate pensions for those over 80 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the available information and general knowledge, the claim is likely FALSE. However, without more specific information related to the claim and the Indian government's actions during the pandemic, it is impossible to provide a definitive classification.", "response": "FALSE."}

The hypothesis was reasonable, but some of the ways in which it has been tested—and some of the people testing it—have attracted intense scrutiny.\nSpeaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump stoked the fires again, seeming to deny that the FDA advice is a thing, and attacking one study, carried out on a group of veterans, as the “phony” work of people who are “obviously not friends of the administration.” (As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale wrote afterward, there are valid reasons to question the study, but it’s not a hatchet job.)

The president does not (as far as we know) have COVID-19 (or malaria), and there’s no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine works against it; Trump’s Food and Drug Administration even warned, last month, that COVID-19 patients should not administer it outside of a clinical or hospital setting because it can cause heart problems.\nIn mid-March, Rigano appeared on Ingraham’s Fox show, and then on Tucker Carlson’s; he told Carlson, who had introduced Rigano as “an adviser at the Stanford University School of Medicine” (he isn’t), that Raoult is “the most eminent infectious disease specialist in the world” (nope), and that he (Rigano) was “here to announce… the second cure to a virus of all time” (he wasn’t). “It’s our job to be skeptical of all and any claims,” Carlson said, calling on the federal government to investigate. “However, I very much want to believe this.” So, apparently, did the president, who picked up on hydroxychloroquine soon after.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: President Trump Says He Is Taking Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive ...\nContent:\nTrump says he consulted with White House doctor on taking antimalarial drug that he has called a possible defense against coronavirus\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Trump says he takes hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Donald Trump <strong>said</strong> Monday that he has been taking anti-malaria drug <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> for over a week to prevent coronavirus infection.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-05-21\nTitle: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, unproven drug he's touted ...\nContent:\n<strong>President</strong> Trump on Monday told reporters he&#x27;s been taking <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, <strong>the</strong> unproven drug he touted for COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-25, states that President Trump announced he finished taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug he had been taking to protect himself from the coronavirus.\n\nInformation 2 provides context for Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine, mentioning that scientists have been examining whether chloroquine, to which hydroxychloroquine is related, might work against COVID-19.

Facebook has taken action against some of these figures, removing or restricting accounts that repeatedly share debunked claims.\n\nInformation 4, published without a specific date, is a survey of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 23 countries in 2022. The survey found that willingness to accept vaccination was at 79.1%, up 5.2% from June 2021.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2022-05-17, is a statement for healthcare professionals about how COVID-19 vaccines work. It emphasizes the critical role of vaccines in preventing deaths and hospitalizations caused by infectious diseases.\n\nClaim Evaluation:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-04-22, states that Facebook posts shared in at least three countries claim to offer a legal way to refuse vaccination. According to Information 1 and 2, these claims are indeed false. Vaccination is not compulsory in most Australian states and Canadian provinces, while exemptions can be obtained in the United States as well as Canada's Ontario and New Brunswick. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate in terms of the posts circulating, but it fails to mention that the advice being shared is false.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-04-22, which is earlier than Information 1 and 2. However, the claim does not provide any fact-checking or debunking of the information being shared in the Facebook posts. Information 1 and 2, published later, clarify that the advice being shared in the posts is false. Therefore, while the claim correctly identifies the circulation of the posts, it does not provide the full context, making it partially accurate.\n\nEvidence:\n\nInformation 1 and 2, published on 2020-04-27 and 2020-04-22 respectively, state that the claims made in the Facebook posts are false. These posts, shared in at least three countries, claim to provide advice on how to legally decline a vaccine, even though vaccination is not compulsory in most Australian states and Canadian provinces, and exemptions can be obtained in the United States as well as Canada's Ontario and New Brunswick.", "response": "FALSE."}

Initial studies implied that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors might increase the risk of viral infection and aggravate disease severity, thereby causing panic given the high global prevalence of hypertension. Nonetheless, subsequent evidence supported the administration of antihypertensive drugs and noted that they do not increase the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with hypertension, rather may have a beneficial effect.\nPreliminary data have shown that RAAS inhibitors upregulate ACE2 receptor expression in animal models, raising concerns about whether these drugs increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and result in poor clinical prognosis. Recent evidence suggests a negative association between the administration of RAAS blockers and the risk of COVID-19. Jiang et al examined whether hypertension or RAS suppression could regulate ACE2 levels.72 The results showed that ACE2 expression was increased in both the lungs and kidneys of older adults. Neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment altered ACE2 expression in the human kidney.\nThe prevalence of hypertension in Chinese patients with COVID-19 was estimated to be between 15% and 25%.8 In the United States, meanwhile, 49.7% of COVID-19–hospitalized patients had hypertension.9 It was reported that a 2-fold to 3-fold higher prevalence of hypertension was a risk for progression to critical illness or even death in the population.10,11 Pranata et al demonstrated that hypertension increased the likelihood of bad outcomes, such as the severity of infection, ARDS, and mortality in patients infected with COVID-19.12 · Presently, no specific drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19.\nThe use of ACEIs and ARBs was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization than the use of CCBs [hazard ratio, 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.83) and 0.84 (0.76–0.93), respectively] and a lower risk of intubation/death. Moreover, risks were slightly lower for ACEI users than for ARB users.75 · Therefore, clinical studies (Table ​(Table1)1) support the hypothesis that the administration of antihypertensive drugs does not enhance the severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-01\nTitle: Study Finds Link Between COVID and Risk for Hypertension – ...\nContent:\nCLEVELAND – Researchers are continuing to learn more about the long-term effects of COVID-19. Now, a new study shows the virus has been associated with a risk for developing hypertension, otherwise known as high blood pressure. “This study provides another important piece of evidence detailing the impact of COVID-19 on cardiometabolic health within the United States, particularly with blood pressure increases,” said Luke Laffin, MD, cardiologist for Cleveland Clinic.\nAccording to the study, at a six month follow up, hypertension was seen in about 20% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and nearly 11% of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Researchers also found those hospitalized with COVID-19 were twice as likely to develop hypertension than those who contracted influenza.\nResearchers also found those hospitalized with COVID-19 were twice as likely to develop hypertension than those who contracted influenza.

A scientific ...\nContent:\nThe viral structural spike (S) protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry to cells; this has led to suggestions that use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) may be implicated in poorer outcomes with COVID-19 [17, 18]. Whilst gaining much publicity, with attendant worry for patients and clinicians, this theory has been debated and ACE inhibitor and ARB treatment has also been associated with improved outcomes in some reports [19, 20]. Polymorphism in expression of the ACE2 receptor gene in association with hypertension and excess cardiovascular risk in ethnic minority groups has also been suggested as a partial explanation for observed excess mortality from COVID-19 in these populations [21, 22]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are currently undertaking a rapid review of this topic [23]. Recent observational studies of confirmed COVID-19 patients have increased confidence that these drugs are \nIt must also be acknowledged that these observational data carry risks of residual confounding [27]. One retrospective cohort study found a positive association between ACE inhibitor or ARB use and admission to hospital (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.38–2.71) or intensive care (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.07–2.51) in small subgroup analyses (N = 421 and 161, respectively) [26]. These secondary outcomes are rightly viewed with caution due to the potential for residual confounding by co-morbidity and also imprecision (as evidenced by wide confidence intervals) due to small sample sizes [28]. Nevertheless, these studies taken together convey a consistent message of absence of harm associated with anti-hypertensive medications during infection with coronavirus, and clinical equipoise should therefore apply. Whilst these drugs appear increasingly unlikely to worsen COVID-19 severity, the consequences of poor blood pressure control, under normal circumstances, are well documented [16]. Consequently, the British a\nHypertension is the single largest global contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost [1]. The majority of the population aged over 60 years have hypertension [2], and it has been suggested that they may be at increased risk from the effects of COVID-19. Despite this, and perhaps due to its ubiquity in the older population, current UK Government guidance does not identify people with hypertension as ʻat risk’ [3], however, other bodies such as the British Heart Foundation and the Health Service Executive in Ireland do [4, 5]. This article seeks to summarise and interpret the current evidence for and against an increase in COVID-19 risk and severity for those with raised blood pressure, and discusses the implications for the choice of anti-hypertensive treatment.\nJournal of Human Hypertension - COVID-19 and hypertension: risks and management.

Another study suggested that nifedipine and amlodipine significantly reduced the death rate and the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 [26]. Regarding the mortality rate and the length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, Nouri-Vaskeh et al. found no significant differences in the administration of losartan or amlodipine in COVID-19 patients with primary hypertension [27].\nTwo other studies concluded that using ACE inhibitors/ARBs was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization in hypertensive patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [51, 52]. Furthermore, prehospitalization and in-hospital use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs also had a protective role in treating this population [53, 54]. In Tian et al.'s study, the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs resulted in longer hospital stays [55]. In general, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued in hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [47, 56].\nSardu et al. found no significant differences in the study endpoints including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, cardiac injury, and deaths between patients in ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs groups [66]. Khera et al. reported that the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs did not increase the risk of hospitalization or mortality in individuals with hypertension [67]. Furthermore, a large cohort study also found no association between using ACE inhibitors and ARBs and an increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [68].\nYuan et al. reported that COVID-19 patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors had a lower risk of death, ICU admissions, and septic shock, and patients who used beta-blockers, CCBs, and diuretics did not show any significant difference compared with the patients with uncontrolled blood pressure [54]. Besides, the patients in the ACE inhibitors and ARBs group had lower IL-6 levels and peak viral load than patients treated with beta-blockers, CCBs, and diuretics [43]. In a detailed meta-analysis, Ren et al. also confirmed that the mortality and severity of COVID-19 were significantly lower in the patients taking ACE inhibitors/ARBs than in controls.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-05-05, is an article that discusses a new study appearing in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Moreover, most of the people who use cannabis also report tobacco use concurrently. This fact may increase the risk of exposure to toxic substances, as certain co-users (for example, blunt users) tend to have higher levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled air and cannabis smoke may have higher levels of some carcinogens than tobacco smoke [7]. Previous studies have indicated that long-term cannabis use is associated with high mortality rates, heart disease [8], metabolic syndromes and changes in the immune system [9].

Too many cytokines may lead to some of the more severe complications of COVID-19. But the studies are still limited, and this is just one of many factors in your body’s response to infection. Early studies have found that the coronavirus can attach to particles in secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosols from e-cigarettes.\nWhen they're damaged, they're less able to prevent the virus from settling into your lungs. The new coronavirus enters cells in your lungs by binding to things called ACE2 receptors. Researchers found that cigarette smoke increases your ACE2 levels, though it’s not clear what effect this might have on your chances of getting COVID-19.\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19. If you smoke or vape, you're one of them. That means it's even more important for you to take steps to protect yourself from the new coronavirus.\nQuit smoking and vaping if you can.

(There were differences among the vaccines, with Moderna’s primary series of two shots showing the highest effectiveness of 62% one month after the series, and Sinovac’s demonstrating the lowest effectiveness at 32%.) After six months, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines dropped further to 14%, and to 9% after nine months.\nFood and Drug Administration will convene its panel of vaccine experts to figure that out: the first step toward turning COVID-19 into a vaccine that’s updated and administered on a fixed schedule. Correction: The original version of this story misstated the time period after which vaccine effectiveness wanes to 9%. It is nine months, not six months\nThe scientists, led by a team from Italy, analyzed 40 studies that documented people’s vaccination status and their subsequent infections with COVID-19, confirmed by lab tests. The studies included data from both the Delta and Omicron surges. Overall, the researchers found that one month after people received two doses of either mRNA vaccine (from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), the vaccine from AstraZeneca, or the shot from Sinovac, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19.\nBooster doses after the primary series restored protection back to levels achieved just after the primary vaccination, but this protection waned too, at a rate similar to that after the primary series, dropping from 60% at one month after the booster dose to 13% at nine months. This drop in efficacy corresponded to rates of lab-confirmed positive tests for Delta and Omicron infections. ... The studies in the review did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against more severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19; other studies to date have shown that protection against more serious outcomes wanes much more slowly than against symptomatic infection, and that the shots continue to protect pretty well against these more dire events.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-09-27\nTitle: Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC\nContent:\nThis protection is sometimes called “natural immunity”. The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19.\nAs the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. FACT: Vaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement.\nAfter getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors.\nBoth messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-09-22\nTitle: Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines Work | CDC\nContent:\nProtein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19.\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-12-13\nTitle: How COVID-19 Immunity Works at This Point in the Pandemic | Time\nContent:\nAntibodies produced after an infection peak a few months after recovery, then start to wane (just like the initial wave of antibodies generated by vaccines). That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people wait about three months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting a booster shot, since their immune systems are already stimulated and may react more aggressively with side effects to the shot.\nIt’s clear that vaccinations and boosters will continue to play an important role in protecting against COVID-19. It will take time for the latest BA.4/5 boosters to generate the broadest range of immunity via antibodies and T cells, so public-health experts may need a few more months of data to decide whether people will need to get additional boosters, and if so, which ones.\nImmunization is the most effective way to launch this antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the virus itself also triggers the process, but to a lesser extent. Studies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected. However those antibodies are produced, they tend to wane after a few months.\nStudies show that levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 virus are higher among people who are vaccinated than among those who are unvaccinated and get infected.

However, now the first evidence is emerging · On 1 April, Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose.\nThe good news is that there is reason to believe that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines will last at least longer than six months. Natural immunity (i.e. immunity in people who have been infected with COVID-19) can last for up to eight months, according to research published in Science. Vaccine-derived immunity can sometimes be stronger and longer-lasting, but this is by no means always the case, and so with COVID-19 vaccines the jury is still out.\nMillions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being delivered across the world, but what do we know about how long will immunity last?\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2023-05-05, provides an analysis of 40 studies on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies showed that one month after being fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), AstraZeneca, or Sinovac vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was 53% in protecting against symptoms of COVID-19. After six months, the overall effectiveness dropped to 14%, and to 9% after nine months. Booster doses restored protection, but this protection also waned over time. The studies did not delve into how well the vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2023-09-27, explains how vaccines work and debunks myths about COVID-19 vaccines.

Throughout 2020, the Donald Trump administration repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic, adding further friction to a relationship already strained by a trade war and U.S. responses to China’s rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, among other issues.\nMany critics say Trump’s use of inflammatory rhetoric such as “China virus” and “kung flu” contributed to a rise in anti-Asian bias in the United States amid the pandemic. President Joe Biden has tread more carefully, choosing not to support any one theory about the virus’s origin; but he and top officials in his administration have persistently called for further investigation in China, which has angered Beijing.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-12-26\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China was the first country to experience an outbreak of the disease, the first to impose drastic measures in response (including lockdowns and face mask mandates), and one of the first countries to bring the outbreak under control.\nUntil late 2022, the Chinese government response included a zero-COVID strategy, which aims to eliminate transmission of the virus within the country and allow resumption of normal economic and social activity, making it one of few countries to pursue this approach. By late 2020, China's economy continued to broaden recovery from the recession during the pandemic, with stable job creation and record international trade growth, although retail consumption was still slower than predicted.\nChina's response to the initial Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak has been both praised and criticised. Some have criticised the censorship of information that might be unfavorable for local officials. Observers have attributed this to a culture of institutional censorship affecting the country's press and Internet. The government censored whistleblowers, journalists, and social media posts about the outbreak. During the beginning of the pandemic, the Chinese government made efforts to clamp down on discussion and hide reporting about it.\nIn November 2021, the Chinese government pledged to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million donated doses and 400 million other doses, in addition to the 200 million doses it had already provided. In the same announcement, Xi pledged additional investment in Africa and promised to send 1,500 public health experts.

The study was conducted at Yale University by two trainees and a lead scientist.

Researchers fed mice infected with the influenza virus a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which resulted in a higher survival rate than compared to those on a normal high-carbohydrate diet. The team found the ketogenic diet, or keto for short, triggered the release immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung and trapped the virus before it became worse.\nDuring the study, the team showed that mice infected with the flu virus that were fed the keto diet had a higher survival rate than mice on a high-carb normal diet. The researchers were more excited to find the details behind this event. The keto diet actually triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung -while the high-carbohydrate diet did not. When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.\nThe two trainees are, Ryan Molony who found that immune system activators called inflammasomes can cause harmful immune system responses in their host, and Emily Goldberg who worked in Dixit's lab, which had shown that the ketogenic diet blocked formation of inflammasomes.

The most famous example of pandemics in the pre-modern period was the plague, which repeatedly struck most of Europe and the Near East in successive waves across the centuries.\nIslamic ethical discussions on the themes of plagues and pandemics grew out of commentaries on specific references in the foundational sources: the Qurʾān and Prophetic reports. These references center around a number of moral questions such as: justification for these incidents; relationship between these events and divine destiny as well as the proper view and attitude of a believer towards these events; scope of human intervention and the extent to which such intervention is obligatory; impact of these incidents on ritual deeds; and finally impact of these incidents on social interpersonal interactions.\nHistorical accounts of the various epidemics and plague pandemics that struck different regions at different times show how Islamic normative discussions on topics such as contagion, illness, and medical treatment shaped the attitudes of Muslims during these times. One of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\nOne of the common themes in historiographical surveys of plague pandemics in the Muslim World is the role of Islam in promoting a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.

This article examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the global pandemic during its early months and provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives.\nDuring data collection, the authors identified six newly established pro-Islamic State groups and channels with coronavirus or pandemic names and themes, in both English and Arabic. Examples include the now defunct Telegram channels “The Pandemic,” “korounna,” and “COVID-19,” among others. Naming groups could be undertaken for various reasons to include: supporters exploiting a timely subject, supporters creating groups and channels dedicated to coronavirus news and discussion, or supporters evading pro-Islamic State group and channel shutdowns through the use of non-Islamic State-themed names.25 When considering the content within these groups and channels, the most plausible reasons are utilizing the newsworthy and global nature of the virus, along with a desire to discuss COVID-19 in environments of shared belief.\nIn turn, 11 dominant themes and narratives were identified, highlighting the ways in which decentralized online pro-Islamic State networks create content designed to appeal to a diverse audience, capitalize on a current event, as well as provide a space for community engagement and camaraderie in a time of social isolation. Although the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic brought much of the world to a stand-still, the internet has allowed people to remain virtually connected and updated on the latest COVID-19-related news, including violent extremist groups and terrorist organizations.\nIt is important to note that the framing of this category is not meant to infer that religion does not have bearing on other themes and narratives in the dataset, including the divine punishment and vindictive categories. Islamic State Coronavirus News: content that denotes the sharing of Islamic State news on the coronavirus. Socioeconomic Decay: content includes discussions on what life will look like after the pandemic: social unrest, economic devastation, and the collapse of society.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-14, discusses a specific instance of misinformation spreading on social media related to the coronavirus pandemic. This includes a video of a choir from Bosnia and Herzegovina that was falsely claimed to be a recording of musicians from various religious backgrounds reciting the 99 names of God in Islam during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. Additionally, a photo of an Egyptian doctor was shared with a false claim that he had invented a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nInformation 2, the publication date is not provided, discusses the targeting of Muslims on social media during the coronavirus pandemic.

It highlights how these discussions have shaped the attitudes of Muslims during past pandemics and how they promote a fatalistic attitude in the face of recurrent plague eruptions.\n\nInformation 5, published on 2020-06-29, examines unofficial pro-Islamic State media responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a content analysis of various themes and narratives in pro-Islamic State media related to the pandemic.\n\nClaim:\nThe claim is that the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a wave of Islamic-themed myths on social media.\n\nJudgement:\nThe claim is TRUE based on the available information.

While it is true that there are efforts to promote a digital economy and the use of digital payments, there is no evidence to suggest that cash will be completely eliminated or that people's money will be put on a chip. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that people will be starved if they reject the vaccine and do not have a chip. While there have been proposals to pay people to be vaccinated, these payments are intended to incentivize vaccination, not to punish those who do not get vaccinated. The use of the word \"chip\" in the claim is also misleading, as it could refer to a microchip implant, but in this context, it seems to be used to refer to a payment card or digital wallet, which is not the same thing.", "response": "FALSE."}

The number of confirmed infections outside China surpassed those inside the country on the same day. As of 17 March, there were 179,112 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including 81,116 in China. Of the 7,426 deaths from the disease, 3,231 have been in China.\nBy the end of the day on 26 March, the United States had overtaken China for the highest number of confirmed cases. Italy is also poised to surpass China in the coming days. Italy and Spain now have the two highest death tolls, with Italy accounting for more than one-third of the global total. COVID-19 has claimed the lives of nearly 23,000 people. More than 120,000 have recovered from the disease.\nThe finding comes from the 31 March Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study found that of about 7,000 people with COVID-19 for whom information about chronic conditions had been reported, just over one-third had an underlying condition. People with such conditions made up 71% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 and 78% of those who required intensive care. Data from China and Italy have also shown that underlying conditions correlate with more severe COVID-19 outcomes, but this is the first such study in the United States.\nAs of 17 March, there were 179,112 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including 81,116 in China. Of the 7,426 deaths from the disease, 3,231 have been in China. Europe had the largest 24-hour spike in new infections, with 8,507 reported since 16 March, and 428 deaths.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on April 2, 2020, states that a Facebook post claiming that China and Japan are \"already FREE of COVID-19\" has been shared more than 11,000 times. The post is written in a mix of Tagalog and English. However, the claim is false as both China and Japan have reported new cases of COVID-19 in the days before and after the misleading posts were shared. WHO's daily situation reports between March 24 and March 28 show that China had reported at least one hundred new cases daily.\n\nInformation 2, published on April 5, 2020, also states that a Facebook post claiming that China and Japan are \"free\" of the novel coronavirus is false. The post was shared multiple times in March 2020, and data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows new cases continue to be reported in both countries.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not available, provides information about the COVID-19 disease, its cause, and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2. It also mentions that the disease was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director-General of the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020.\n\nInformation 4, published on March 13, 2020, states that Chinese officials and news outlets have floated unfounded theories that the United States was the source of the virus.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not available, provides a timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the total number of people who have died from COVID-19 outside China surpassing deaths inside the country for the first time since the disease emerged, and the United States overtaking China for the highest number of confirmed cases.\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim that China and Japan are free of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, is false. Both China and Japan have reported new cases of COVID-19 in the days before and after the misleading posts were shared. The WHO's daily situation reports show that China had reported at least one hundred new cases daily between March 24 and March 28.

By allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities.\nThe new prices for COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, has triggered a debate in India. Some argue that the prices are too high for everyone to be able to afford, and some say that it should be free for all and the government should bear the cost. The government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it.\nThe government already has a lot of expenses piling up as it manages the pandemic, and hence, there are also those who see merit in arguing that those who can pay for the vaccine, must pay for it. However, there is a problem with letting private and for-profit companies charge different prices from different customers. These are the prices fixed by Serum Institute of India (SII) for the Covishield vaccine:\nBy allowing vaccine makers to choose the pricing based on who is buying the vaccine, the government may give the producer an incentive to direct more vaccines to the more expensive private hospitals, whereas a majority of the country still depends on state-run facilities. “Pricing should be uniform. Both the central and state governments should pay the same price for the vaccine.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2021-06-10\nTitle: For all its “made in India” pitch, Covaxin is the most expensive ...\nContent:\nRaches Ella, a project lead at the company, tweeted that the last volunteer for Covaxin’s phase 3 trial was vaccinated in mid-March, and it takes time to sift through data and to publish results in a peer-reviewed publication. Covaxin was granted emergency use approval in January. ““Whereas the company says it will not be ready to share phase 3 results even in a preprint before July, it already presented the interim safety and efficacy data of 127 cases to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee in April,” Aisola says.\nAt Rs1,200 ($16.42) a dose, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a Covid-19 vaccine fully developed and manufactured in India, is the most pricey option available at private hospitals in India. The vaccine is not only more expensive than the other locally manufactured option, Covishield, but costs more than even the imported Sputnik V.\nThese prices were announced by vaccine makers in April when the Indian government allowed companies to directly sell to states and private hospitals. Vaccine makers can reserve 25% of their stock for private vaccination centres under this policy. But even in this limited scope, Bharat Biotech’s prices seem unjustified.\nFor one, Covaxin is a homegrown vaccine, developed jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s medical research arm. In fact, the ICMR is entitled to a 5% royalty on Covaxin sales. Such a vaccine should have ideally offered an economic benefit to the Indian government and its citizens, especially since it cuts down the effort of negotiating in an international market.\n\nInformation summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, states that most Indians are being made to pay for their COVID-19 shots and the government is allowing vaccine producers to charge whatever they like. India needs 1.9 billion doses of vaccines to cover its entire adult population. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being administered in India.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing its citizens COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. Private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose.\n\nInformation 3 is a repetition of Information 1.\n\nInformation 4, published after the claim, discusses the debate around the high prices of the Covishield vaccine and the argument that the vaccine should be free for all. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nInformation 5, published after the claim, states that Covaxin is the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine available at private hospitals in India, costing Rs. 1,200 ($16.42) per dose. However, it does not contradict the information in Information 2.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim that \"in India, the vaccine is free of cost whereas other countries are charging for the vaccine\" is only partially true. According to Information 2, the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities, whereas private health facilities may recover a charge subject to a ceiling of Rs. 250 per person per dose. This information contradicts the claim that the vaccine is free of cost in India, but it is still more affordable than in other countries where the vaccine is not provided for free.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks important context. The claim should have specified that the vaccine is free of cost in public healthcare facilities in India, but not necessarily in private healthcare facilities.\n\nReasonable evidence:\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, clearly states that the Indian government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of cost in public healthcare facilities. This information is from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making it a reliable source.

The share of deaths linked to long-term care facilities for older adults is even starker at the state level.

AARP continues to urge elected officials to take action to combat this national tragedy, make sure it does not happen again, and ensure that public funds provided to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are used for testing, PPE, staffing, virtual visits, and for the health and safety of residents.\nWhile high primary vaccination rates for residents and staff have given us hope, and have saved many lives, there remain many nursing home residents who are not vaccinated at all, and more than half are not up to date on COVID-19 boosters. Residents and staff who are not up to date are more susceptible to adverse outcomes from COVID-19 exposure, and staff who are not up to date could place residents at unnecessary risk.\nAll nursing home data are from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File (downloaded most recently on 9/1/2023).

If the content described by the CLAIM is correct, then classify it as TRUE; if the content described by the CLAIM is incorrect, then classify it as FALSE.\n\nCLAIM:\nPublication date: 2020-11-19\nContent: The total number of deaths in the U.S. this year is significantly down compared to previous years, so COVID-19 restrictions weren’t needed.\n\nPRIOR KNOWLEDGE:\nInformation 1:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19\nContent:\nDeath counts were derived from the National Vital Statistics System database that provides the timeliest access to the vital statistics mortality data and may differ slightly from other sources due to differences in completeness, COVID-19 definitions used, data processing, and imputation of missing dates. Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years. Data for jurisdictions where counts are between 1 and 9 are suppressed.\nEstimates by race and Hispanic origin are weighted using the methods described above. Weekly counts are shown for deaths due to all causes, all causes excluding COVID-19, and COVID-19. Because estimates are weighted to account for incomplete reporting in recent weeks, counts of death due to COVID-19 will not match other data sources. For data years 2018 – 2020, race and Hispanic-origin categories are based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, allowing for the presentation of data by single race and Hispanic origin.\nWeekly counts of deaths are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Counts of deaths from all causes of death, including COVID-19, are presented. As some deaths due to COVID-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths (for example, if COVID-19 was not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.\nHowever, regardless of the methodology used, the estimated expected numbers of deaths and corresponding estimates of excess deaths are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as the pandemic has gone on for more than three years as it is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred. More information is available in the Frequently Asked Questions section. ... Select a dashboard: Weekly Excess Deaths Excess deaths with and without COVID-19 Excess deaths with and without weighting Number of Excess Deaths\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The true death toll of COVID-19: estimating global excess mortality\nContent:\nThe COVID TAG considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability and extensibility proposed a negative binomial regression model. The model predicts the number of total deaths for the year 2020 conditional on the population size and expected deaths for the year as well as a predicted mortality rate parameter. This rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables.\nYet preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million, representing 1.2 million more deaths than officially reported. With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19.\nWith the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.4 million, based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 deaths are a key indicator to track the evolution of the pandemic. However, many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death.\nThis rate parameter captures both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 and is modelled using country-specific variables. For 2020, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 is defined as the difference between the total observed deaths for the year and those expected in the absence of COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) - Our ...\nContent:\nBesides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference as we have with the P-scores, we can also look at the raw death count as shown in the chart here. The raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year.\nWe use an estimate produced by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak as part of their World Mortality Dataset (WMD).4 To produce this estimate, they first fit a regression model for each region using historical deaths data from 2015–2019.5 They then use the model to project the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020–2023.6 Their model can capture both seasonal variation and year-to-year trends in mortality. For more details on this method, see the article Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset.7 · Previously we used a different expected deaths baseline: the average number of deaths over the years 2015–2019.8 We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality.9 The WMD projection, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it acco\nThe raw death count gives us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 470,000 excess deaths in 2020, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that year. However, this measure is less comparable across countries due to large differences in populations. You can still see the death counts for other countries by clicking “Change country” on the chart. ... Many countries have not reported any data on all-cause mortality during the pandemic. If we want to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths in those countries, as well as globally, we must find a way to estimate this death toll.\nThe excess mortality includes not only those who have died from COVID-19, but also those from all other causes — and these numbers may also be changing due to the overall pandemic conditions. This means both metrics are needed to understand the total impact of the pandemic on deaths. Excess mortality data is unfortunately not available for many countries, and because the required data from previous years is lacking this will continue to be the case.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: U.S. Deaths Spiked as COVID-19 Continued\nContent:\nIn 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, surpassing all other causes except heart disease and cancer and driving the large increase in total U.S. deaths for that year. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths increased by 0.82%. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality.\nDeaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, an indication that despite widespread availability of vaccines, COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. U.S. deaths have regular annual cycles — normally increasing in the winter and declining in the summer months (Figure 2). Every year between 2010 and 2019 followed suit with the highest number of deaths in December, January or February. The lowest number of deaths occurred in July and August. These patterns held true throughout the decade, even as the level of deaths rose each month. COVID-19 disrupted seasonality the same way it disrupted annual mortality patterns.\nDeaths in the United States increased by 19% between 2019 and 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 — the largest spike in mortality in 100 years. And deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S.\nAnd deaths remained elevated in 2021 as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2021, population estimates. County-level estimates were released today and national estimates in December. Prior to the pandemic, mortality patterns were predictable. Deaths had been increasing slowly but steadily. Additionally, mortality followed a seasonal trend, peaking in the winter months. The annual increase in deaths in 2020 was the largest in 100 years. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has disrupted these patterns and it is unclear when or if the regularities of pre-pandemic mortality will return.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nContent:\nCOVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. The provisional data presented on this page include the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; by week ending date, month, and year, and specific jurisdictions.\nDeath counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nDeath counts are delayed and may differ from other published sources (see Technical Notes). Counts will be updated Thursdays by 5pm. The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System.\n\nInformation 1 is from the CDC and provides a method for estimating excess deaths, which is the difference between the number of deaths that occurred and the number that would be expected under normal circumstances. This method takes into account various factors such as incomplete reporting, differences in data sources, and the use of race and Hispanic origin categories. Information 2 is a report from the COVID-19 TAG that proposes a negative binomial regression model to estimate the number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The report suggests that the true death toll of COVID-19 is likely higher than the officially reported number, with preliminary estimates indicating at least 3 million global deaths in 2020. Information 3 is from a source that uses the World Mortality Dataset to estimate excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw death count for the US in 2020 was roughly 470,000, compared to 352,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Information 4 is from a source that reports on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in the US. In 2020, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death and drove a large increase in total US deaths. Deaths in 2021 were still up 19.7% from 2019, indicating that COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact on mortality. Information 5 is from the National Center for Health Statistics and provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 in the US.\n\nBased on this information, the claim that the total number of deaths in the US in 2020 is significantly down compared to previous years is false. In fact, the opposite is true. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a large increase in total US deaths in 2020, with deaths still up 19.7% in 2021 compared to 2019. The claim appears to be an attempt to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in the US.", "response": "FALSE."}

Social Distancing via TikTok: Using Humor and Facts to Educate During COVID-19 - Medscape - Apr 16, 2020.\nIn fact, the US Surgeon General asked social media influencers to use their platforms to engage and inform younger Americans about COVID-19. In response, I shifted my content to focus on COVID-19 and what each individual person can do to help prevent spread of this illness. And guess what? It is definitely working. After creating a video explaining why social distancing is so important, a follower replied, \"I didn't used to understand it.\nSocial distancing has left many people feeling isolated and searching for answers about COVID-19.

Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease. ... Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild and patients usually recover without complications or treatment.\nAs a common immunological defence mechanism, immune cells respond to foreign infection by producing large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy invading organisms [22]. Previous pathological and histological examinations showed that coronaviruses and influenza induced significant downregulation of the airway antioxidant system, leading to lethal lung injury and death from ARDS due to oxidative damage [23]. The autopsy pathology of the novel coronavirus is similar to other virus-induced ARDS. In a report of 29 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 27 (93%) showed increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of oxidative stress injury [24].

The study was stopped early by an operational and safety monitoring board due to futility after 40% of the planned 520 participants were enrolled (n = 214).\nSince the most recent revision of this section, the results from several cohort studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses on the use of vitamin C in patients with COVID-19 have been published in peer-reviewed journals or have been made available as manuscripts before peer review. However, most of these studies had significant limitations, such as a small sample size or a lack of randomization or blinding. In addition, the study designs had different doses or formulations of vitamin C and different outcome measures, and the study populations included patients with varying concomitant medications and COVID-19 disease severity.\nIn addition, the study designs had different doses or formulations of vitamin C and different outcome measures, and the study populations included patients with varying concomitant medications and COVID-19 disease severity.

Results from adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide further guidance on the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published before the claim, is from PolitiFact and FactCheck.org stating that there is no evidence that high doses of vitamin C can slow or stop the spread of the coronavirus. A Facebook post by Andrew Saul, also mentioned, claims that vitamin C can slow or stop the coronavirus, but this is not supported by evidence.\n\nInformation 2, published after the claim, explains that vitamin C is being investigated for its potential to prevent or treat COVID-19, but there is currently no evidence to suggest that it can treat or slow the virus. Vitamin C, especially in the form of an intravenous (IV) infusion, is thought to help manage complications, but it cannot treat or cure coronavirus.\n\nInformation 3, the publication date is not clear, mentions that a pulmonologist and critical care specialist, Dr. Andrew G. Weber, is giving his intensive-care patients with the coronavirus 1500 mg of vitamin C intravenously, with that dose repeated three or four times a day. Dr. Weber stated that his patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C.\n\nInformation 4, the publication date is not clear, suggests that high-dose vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterials, and antiviral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive, and toxic, complicating the disease course.\n\nInformation 5, the publication date is not clear, mentions that an open-label trial conducted at 2 sites in the United States, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to receive either 10 days of oral ascorbic acid 8,000 mg, zinc gluconate 50 mg, both agents, or standard of care.

A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain.\nResearchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest.\nSome people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness.

The test can be performed in environments where the patient specimen is both collected and analyzed, such as doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, using an instrument about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage.\nThe performance of the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer was validated in a large study of 2,409 individuals, including those with and without symptoms. In the study, the test was shown to have 91.2% sensitivity (the percent of positive samples the test correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the percent of negative samples the test correctly identified).\nWhen the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer detects the presence of VOC markers of SARS-CoV-2, a presumptive (unconfirmed) positive test result is returned and should be confirmed with a molecular test. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as they do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions.\nInspectIR expects to be able to produce approximately 100 instruments per week, which can each be used to evaluate approximately 160 samples per day. At this level of production, testing capacity using the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer is expected to increase by approximately 64,000 samples per month.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2023-07-31\nTitle: Scientists develop breath test that rapidly detects COVID-19 virus ...\nContent:\nLouis have developed a breath test that quickly identifies those who are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

In a national cohort of 6 million veterans in the USA, Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested and to test positive for COVID-19 than Whites.[4] In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysed all deaths in England and Wales with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nPeople in ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with higher exposure to coronavirus infection, which could result in more cases of COVID-19.[1] On the other hand, ethnic minority populations tend to be younger on average than the UK population, and younger people are less susceptible to severe illness following infection. The total numbers of deaths recorded in hospitals are similar per capita for Black African and White ethnic groups.\nThe difference was particularly large for Black men and women, who were more than four times as likely to die from COVID-19 than White men and women.[5] Can these differences be explained in terms of exposure to coronavirus infection, or susceptibility to severe illness and death following infection, or both?\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds are more likely to die ...\nContent:\nAfter adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian backgrounds were 1.49 times more likely to die compared to those from white backgrounds, and patients from black backgrounds were 1.30 times more likely to die.

Recently, a team of investigators affiliated with the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), decided to investigate the potential of a common antibiotic — azithromycin — in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization.

To learn more about the trial, and understand why the researchers chose to study azithromycin, despite specialists typically · advising against antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, Medical News Today spoke to one of the trial’s principal investigators, Catherine Oldenburg, Sc.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nIt is something that you definitely see: Short term increases in isolation of resistance, following a course of antibiotics, and for the long term, the effects of that are unknown. I think, in terms of doing a trial of azithromycin, the resistance point is really key for doing a trial because if we know that azithromycin does not work for COVID-19, that means that providers won’t be prescribing [it] for COVID-19. But if there’s this sort of general feeling — which I think there is right now — that’s kind of, well, maybe it might help, maybe it doesn’t hurt, then we might actually, paradoxically, see more prescribing of azithromycin.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Inadequate use of antibiotics in the covid-19 era: effectiveness ...\nContent:\nSome researchers have concentrated on the use of macrolides in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are being studied not only for their anti-bacterial activity, but also their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. They could be particularly useful in viral infections such as COVID-19, which are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, through the antibiotics’ attenuation of cytokine production [21,22,23]. Likewise, azithromycin has shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 or Zika virus [24, 25].\nProspective clinical studies on antibiotic prescription and systematic analyses of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co-infection must conducted in order to evaluate the influence of current and future viral pandemics on antimicrobial resistance and the development of superinfections. This line of research is critical for avoiding unintended consequences resulting in broad antimicrobial resistance in the near future.

There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.\nInclusion criteria were journal articles reporting clinical studies on treatment of Covid-19 patients with antibiotics. Case reports, non-clinical studies, reports on coronavirus other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and articles not mentioning the use of antibiotic in these patients were excluded from the review. Studies for which data about antibiotic treatment were too scarce were excluded. Research was limited to English-language articles relative to adults.\nNo study investigated the type of empiric antibiotic therapy chosen according to the severity of the patient. Future studies in this area are critical to ensure an optimal antimicrobial usage in the Covid-19 patients. Finally, further research is warranted regarding the supportive role of laboratory panels to optimize antimicrobial stewardship.\nThis review presented data from nineteen studies regarding antibiotic usage in 2834 patients with Covid-19 disease. Mean rate of antibiotic usage was 74%. Only 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections and half of the patients who received antibiotics were not severe, indicating a significant tendency to initiate antibiotics in mild or moderate patients. Four retrospective studies reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on mortality. Detailed data on antibiotic use are lacking in most articles. Further research on this matter is critical to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 describes a clinical trial called ACTION, which is investigating the potential of the antibiotic azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 that do not require hospitalization. The trial is being conducted by researchers from the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and recruitment started on May 26, 2020.\n\nInformation 2 discusses the use of macrolides, including azithromycin, in patients with COVID-19. Some macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be useful in viral infections such as COVID-19. Azithromycin has also shown effects against virus replication and internalization processes in other viruses. However, the article also notes the importance of conducting prospective clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration to avoid unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance.\n\nInformation 3 explains that antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a risk of excessive use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 4 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\nInformation 5 is a review of studies on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The review found that antibiotics were used in 74% of patients, mainly in an empirical setting, but there is no proven efficacy of this practice. The review also notes the importance of further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients and to ensure optimal antimicrobial usage.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that a COVID-19 trial lead researcher explains why an antibiotic might work is partially true. The Information 1 describes a clinical trial investigating the potential of azithromycin in treating mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, but the trial has just started and it is too early to say whether the antibiotic will be effective in treating the virus. Information 2 provides some evidence for the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin, but also emphasizes the importance of conducting clinical studies and establishing standard guidelines for antibiotic administration. Information 3, 4 and 5 emphasizes the importance of appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19, as antibiotics are not effective against the virus and their unnecessary use could lead to antibiotic resistance.", "response": "TRUE."}

Kerala, known for its palm-lined beaches on the Arabian Sea, is still reeling with a caseload of 4 million coronavirus infections since the pandemic began.\nBut the virus is not as transmissible as some other viruses. \"There are occasional Nipah superspreaders who infect a lot of people,\" says Luby. \"But the average transmission rate is less than one person per infection.\n\"However, each time a person is infected, the virus is in an environment that selects for human adaptation and transmissibility. The risk is that a new strain that is more efficiently transmitted person to person could generate a devastating outbreak. Indeed, since 70% of people who are infected with Nipah virus die, such a strain could represent the worst pandemic humanity has ever faced.\"\nKerala, known for its palm-lined beaches on the Arabian Sea, is still reeling with a caseload of 4 million coronavirus infections since the pandemic began.

This outbreak resulted in nearly 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths, and caused substantial economic impact as more than 1 million pigs were killed to help control the outbreak.\nWhile there have been no other known outbreaks of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999, outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in some parts of Asia since then—primarily in Bangladesh and India. The virus has been shown to spread from person-to-person in these outbreaks, raising concerns about the potential for NiV to cause a global pandemic.\nNiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it initially spreads between animals and people. The animal host reservoir for NiV is the fruit bat (genus Pteropus), also known as the flying fox. Given that NiV is genetically related to Hendra virus, another henipavirus known to be carried by bats, bat species were quickly singled out for investigation and flying foxes were subsequently identified as the reservoir.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2021-09-12, discusses the recent Nipah virus outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala, which is also dealing with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

While there is a risk of increased childhood obesity due to sedentary behavior during stay-at-home orders, it is also possible that kids could be getting more physical activity at home. The key takeaway is that parents should make a concerted effort to maintain healthy eating habits and promote physical activity during the pandemic. The study mentioned in the information provides evidence that school closures could contribute to a rise in childhood obesity, but it does not necessarily follow that all kids will become obese as a result of stay-at-home orders. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is important to consider the full range of factors at play.", "response": "TRUE."}

This statement of nonmedical exemption from parents and guardians must explain their reasoning based on personal or religious beliefs. Senate Bill 163 still allows for nonmedical exemptions. It requires families to fill out a standardized form and follow a submission process to claim them. Parents or guardians who want an immunization exemption can either submit a certificate of medical exemption with a medical professional’s signature, a nonmedical exemption certificate with a medical professional’s signature or a completion certificate from the state’s online module, the bill's summary states.\nIn an attempt to raise Colorado’s low vaccination rate, state legislators have passed Senate Bill 163, known as the School Entry Immunization Bill. Online misinformation about how the new legislation may affect those who oppose vaccinating their children is sparking confusion. “Mandatory vaccines with no exemptions. Mandatory flu shots? Hah.

Colorado's Senate Bill 163 does not remove exemptions for vaccines. Instead, it changes the process for obtaining nonmedical exemptions, requiring families to fill out a standardized form and follow a submission process. The bill does not force vaccination, include the flu or HPV shot for school children, or require a COVID-19 vaccine, as the claim suggests.", "response": "FALSE."}

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020.\nMandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nThis study adds complementary evidence to the literature on the impacts of widespread community use of face masks on COVID-19 spread from a natural experiment based on whether or not US states had mandated the use of face masks in public for COVID-19 mitigation as of May 2020.\nStates differ in whether or not they require their citizens to wear face masks (covers) to limit COVID-19 spread. Between April 8 and May 15, governors of fifteen states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask do so in public settings (for example, public transportation, grocery stores, pharmacies, or other retail stores) where maintaining six feet of “social distance might not always be practicable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-11-05\nTitle: FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nExplanation: A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of face masks to reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19. However, face masks only confer partial protection and should be combined with other public health measures, such as physical distancing and proper hand hygiene.\nDue to the use of a wide variety of face masks, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of different types of masks and mask material in various community settings, such as public spaces, schools, or workplaces.

And because the PR firm won’t release more details, it’s ultimately untrustworthy. Respondents, for instance, were asked if Corona is related to the coronavirus but were never told it isn’t.

The original press release from 5WPR notes that in a survey of 737 beer-drinking Americans, 38 percent said they “would not buy Corona under any circumstances now.” By presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans’ reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus.\nHave you heard that 38 percent of Americans won’t drink Corona beer, because they are afraid of contracting the coronavirus? For the past hours, this finding has spread across the internet like wildfire (or, more apt, a dangerous disease). CNN, the New York Post, and Vice all wrote up the poll. On Twitter, where “38% of Americans” was the top national trend for parts of the day, many writers with large followings used it as an occasion to condemn their fellow citizens as idiots.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published by PolitiFact, is an article fact-checking a claim about a poll that found 38% of Americans saying they will not drink Corona beer because of the virus. The article explains that the poll was conducted by a PR firm, 5W Public Relations, on American beer drinkers and not Americans overall. The specific question asked in the poll is unknown, and the firm did not release more details about the poll. The article also mentions that the question asked was leading and suggested a correlation between the beer and the virus.

The scam asks for personal information such as bank details, and is not a legitimate government scheme.

Rural Hospitals Prepare for Two Vastly Different Scenarios - Medscape - May 02, 2020.\nNow these stretched-thin hospitals face the added burden of not knowing which scenario to prepare for. Medical care in rural America for decades has been challenged by a population that is older, poorer, and sicker than its urban counterparts. There are fewer ICU beds per capita, fewer options for backup staffing, and less access to specialists (outside of Omaha, there are only two infectious disease doctors in the entire state of Nebraska). It all adds up to make the rural areas vulnerable to the pandemic and its course unpredictable, said Angela Hewlett, MD, MS, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the medical director for the state's Biocontainment Unit.\nSuch wide variation from county to county suggests that rural hospitals may need to prepare differently than their big-city counterparts. While cities have been gearing up for or are already in the midst of a patient surge, some rural areas are experiencing micro-outbreaks — such as the one in Hall County — while others anticipate a slower, more sustained outbreaks that could last for months. Many rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.\nMany rural hospitals already suffer from strained finances, leaving them understaffed or on the brink of shuttering.

The Importance of Rural Hospitals\nContent:\nThere are two very different types of hospitals in the U.S: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and large rural hospitals. There are over 1,000 small rural hospitals, representing nearly one-fourth of all the short-term general hospitals in the country, but they receive only 2% of total national hospital spending.\nAs the country searches for policies that will control or reduce hospital spending while maintaining access to quality care, it is essential to recognize that the nation’s hospitals fall into two very different categories: (1) small rural hospitals, and (2) urban and larger rural hospitals. These two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve.\nHowever, in most cases where small rural hospitals have closed, there is no longer an ED in the community or nearby.18 In many cases, the nearest ED is 30 minutes or more away, and those people who already had to travel a distance to reach the hospital that closed now have to travel 45 minutes or more to reach a hospital. These types of closures cause two different kinds of problems for the residents of the community:\nThese two groups of hospitals differ dramatically in terms of both the amount they contribute to healthcare spending growth and the size of the financial challenges they face in delivering healthcare to the communities they serve. ... Almost one-half of the nation’s short-term general hospitals4 are located in rural areas.5 Rural hospitals differ from urban hospitals both in terms of their size and their distance from other hospitals:\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2022-01-08\nTitle: Rural hospitals theorem - Wikipedia\nContent:\nRoth proved the two parts of the full theorem in two respective papers. ... We will prove the theorem for the special case in which each hospital has only one position. In this case, Part 1 says that all stable matchings have the same set of matched hospitals and the same set of matched doctors, and Part 2 is trivial. It is useful to first visualize what different stable matchings look like (refer to the graphs on the right).\nIn this case, Part 1 says that all stable matchings have the same set of matched hospitals and the same set of matched doctors, and Part 2 is trivial. It is useful to first visualize what different stable matchings look like (refer to the graphs on the right). Consider two different stable matchings, A and B.\nThe rural hospitals theorem answers this question negatively assuming all preferences are strict (i.e., no doctor is indifferent between two hospitals and no hospital is indifferent between two doctors). The theorem has two parts:\nThe rural hospitals theorem (RHT) is a fundamental theorem in the theory of stable matching. It considers the problem of matching doctors to hospitals for residency, where each doctor is matched to a single hospital but each hospital has several positions for doctors.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Why Health Care Is Harder to Access in Rural America | U.S. GAO\nContent:\nMore than 60 million Americans—about one-fifth of the U.S. population—live in rural areas. On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents. But while they may require more medical attention and care, they also might have more limited access to health care.\n\nInformation 1, published on May 2, 2020, is an article discussing the challenges faced by rural hospitals in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic. These hospitals serve older, poorer, and sicker populations with fewer resources, including ICU beds, staffing options, and access to specialists. The unpredictable course of the pandemic and varying outbreak patterns in rural areas require hospitals to prepare for different scenarios.\n\nInformation 2 is not relevant to the claim, as it is an introduction to a public eye health education resource for the state of North Carolina.\n\nInformation 3, while not directly related to the claim, provides context on the differences between small rural hospitals and urban or larger rural hospitals. Small rural hospitals face financial challenges and often serve as the only healthcare access point for their communities.\n\nInformation 4, published on January 8, 2022, discusses the Rural Hospitals Theorem (RHT), which is a theorem in the theory of stable matching. The RHT has two parts, and Part 1 states that all stable matchings have the same set of matched hospitals and doctors. However, this information is not directly related to the claim.\n\nInformation 5, while undated, provides context on the challenges faced by rural residents in accessing healthcare. Rural residents are older and have worse health conditions on average, but they might have limited access to healthcare.\n\nBased on the available information, the claim is partially supported. Rural hospitals are indeed facing challenges in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in Information 1.

Even though the Chinese government discredited the possibility of a lab origin based on genetic studies, the distance of the epicenter from the bat caves raises questions. Moreover, it is widely known that studies involving the study of the transmission of bat SARS-like coronaviruses using cell culture and animal models such as laboratory mice have been conducted for many years all across the world.\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology report stated that the source – bat-related coronavirus – was found in the southern area of Yunnan, same as the origin of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak [11]. Comparatively, the adjacent Wuhan Institute of Virology had raised a higher possibility of this disaster pandemic by spending $44 million on the National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4). Naturally, the origins of the epidemic were investigated. All the studies of Shi Zhengli, the lead virologist from the institute, on bat related coronaviruses were centered in the southern, subtropical areas of Yunnan. However, the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, which is almost 900 km from Yunnan. This cliffhanger seems to point to a possibility that this novel strain of coronavirus was leaked out artificially.\nUp to 96% similarity was found between SARS-COV-2 and the bat coronavirus using whole-genome analysis [7]. This theory was supported by other studies that have been summarized in detail elsewhere [8, 9]. A study supported this suggestive finding by using sequence-based analysis and artificial intelligence on the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus [10]. Snakes were found to be the most probable wildlife repository for the virus compared with other animals [11]. Conversely, another study suggested that SARS-COV-2 could have originated from bats but with pangolins as the possible intermediate hosts [12].\nIn conclusion, all these specific features observed in SARS-COV-2 helps scientists to rule out the idea that this pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is the result of a man-made action that could be either engineered in the laboratory or further created as a bioweapon out of conspiracy.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2021-06-14\nTitle: Nature-based or lab leak?

This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.\nNarrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has. So creating a new, deadly backbone is pretty much impossible. But there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\nBut there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.

It mentions genetic studies that found up to 96% similarity between SARS-COV-2 and bat coronaviruses, and also suggests that pangolins could be possible intermediate hosts. However, the information concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action.\n\nInformation 2, published on June 14, 2021, reports on satellite images showing increased auto traffic around major hospitals in Wuhan in the fall of 2019, suggesting the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present before the outbreak was reported to the world.\n\nInformation 3, published on June 12, 2020, explains that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 was manmade or laboratory-created. It also explains that creating a new virus with significant devastation is currently impossible, but notes that a virus could be created in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 1, 2020, is a fact-check that debunks the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory. It cites the genetics of the virus as evidence that it has natural origins.\n\nInformation 5, published on March 26, 2020, reports on scientists analyzing the coronavirus to reveal its natural origins and debunk conspiracy theories suggesting that it was created in a lab.\n\nClaim Verification:\n\nThe claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory is not supported by the available evidence. Information 4 and 5, both published before the claim, debunk this theory and provide evidence for the natural origins of the virus. Information 1 also concludes that the scientific evidence does not support the idea that the pandemic is the result of a man-made action. Therefore, the claim is likely false.\n\nIt is important to note that Information 2, published after the claim, suggests the possibility of the novel coronavirus being present in Wuhan before the outbreak was reported to the world. However, this information does not support the claim that the virus was artificially created in a laboratory. Additionally, Information 3 explains that while it is possible to create a virus in a lab using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point, there is no evidence to suggest that this is what happened with SARS-COV-2.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the novel coronavirus was artificially created in a laboratory is not supported by the available evidence. The scientific consensus is that the virus has natural origins, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was created in a lab. Therefore, the claim is likely false.", "response": "FALSE."}

As suggested in the apt title of a recent paper by Platje et al. (2020), the COVID‐19 pandemic appears to have been “both an expected and unexpected event.” However, many of the critical challenges that vexed the Trump Administration's response were not only foreseeable but were, in fact, foreseen.\nTrump, sobered by worst‐case scenario death projections (McGraw & Oprysko, 2020), accepted Fauci and Birx's public health framing that a shutdown was needed to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed and save lives (White House, 2020h). Trump was then persuaded to extend the shutdown for an additional 30 days. In addition to the shutdown, to cope with the economic fallout of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Trump supported, and, on March 27, 2020, signed into law, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) (AJMC, 2021).\nIn the US alone, the horrifying costs of the pandemic can be measured in the millions of Americans infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the many hundreds of thousands confirmed dead with or from COVID‐19 to date (Johns Hopkins University, 2022). While the pandemic came as a rude awakening to many nonspecialists, the predominant view among health security professionals was that the question was not whether but when the next major pandemic or public health emergency would strike. Yet, despite these insights, decades of preparedness work, and considerable investment, President Trump, in March 2020, claimed, “Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\nWarnings were regularly made in the media (e.g., Yong, 2018), by prominent individuals, such as Bill Gates in a widely viewed 2015 TED talk, and by Trump's own experts, who predicted, based on a 2019 influenza simulation, that the US would be underprepared, underfunded, and would be unable to respond effectively to a pandemic. With over 400,000 deaths in the US as a result of COVID‐19, at the time Trump left office, this assessment appears tragically prescient. Multiple studies have concluded that many of the deaths in the US were avoidable.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2020-09-19\nTitle: AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s virus revisionism; Biden on the hoax | ...\nContent:\nThe institute now forecasts more than 378,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by Jan. 1. In early April, U.S. officials estimated at least 100,000 would die from the pandemic even if all conceivable steps were taken against it — a thorough and enduring lockdown, full use of masks and more. A death toll up to 240,000 assumed aggressive mitigation. Trump has often cited a potential death toll of 2.2 million or so — a number that puts the reality of several hundred thousand deaths in a better light.\nFirst and most notably, the U.S. is not running “substantially” below projections that 100,000 to 240,000 would die from COVID-19. The death toll is close to 200,000 and the pandemic is far from over. Tens of thousands of new infections are being reported each day. The White House and federal public health authorities have often pointed to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington as a source for their pandemic projections.

TRUMP: “If you look at what we’ve done and all of the lives that we’ve saved … this was our prediction, that if we do a really good job, we’ll be at about a hundred and — 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-10-13\nTitle: The Two Million Lives President Trump has Saved from COVID-19 | ...\nContent:\nKamala Harris claimed that President Donald Trump is personally responsible for the more than 214,00 Americans who have perished from COVID-19. This is factually wrong, disingenuous, immoral and disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working every day to defeat this virus. It completely ignores the real, successful efforts by the Trump administration to save lives.\nBiden, Harris, Democrats and the media may continue to lie about COVID-19. But in the end, the American people will recognize the lives which have been saved and the real efforts which have been made to save them. The virus has tragically killed 214,000 Americans. President Trump—and the brave men and women in our public health system—have saved 2 million.\nIn fact, Biden already has a terrible track record of failing to deal with pandemics—his previous tenure as vice president is part of the reason federal agencies were strapped for resources at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In May, his own former chief of staff, Ron Klain, told Politico it was \"purely a fortuity\" that the Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 outbreak didn't turn out to be \"one of the great mass casualty events in American history.\" Klain continued, \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck.\" We don't need to ask Biden how he would have dealt with the current pandemic, because we know how badly he handled the last major viral event.\nIn the first two debates of the 2020 presidential contest, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen.

The first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to quantitively and reproducibly assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection has been published by a team of Italian experts with experience of using the technology on the front line.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients. The National Health Service in England does not even mention lung ultrasound in its radiology decision tool for suspected COVID-19, specifying instead chest X-ray as the first-line diagnostic imaging tool, with CT scanning in equivocal cases.\nWith regard to the use of wireless technology, the Italian team says that \"in the setting of COVID-19, wireless probes and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment,\" as they can \"easily be wrapped in single-use plastic covers, reducing the risk of contamination,\" and making sterilization easy. Stone suggests that integrated portable devices, however, are no more likely to cause cross-contamination than separate probes and tablets, as they can fit within a sterile sheath as a single unit. Volpicelli, for his part, doesn't like what he sees as undue focus on wireless devices for lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 protocols.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: 2020-04-09\nTitle: First protocol on how to use lung ultrasound to triage COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nThe first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to quantitatively and reproducibly assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection has been published by a team of Italian experts with experience using the technology on the front line.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients.

But Giovanni Volpicelli, MD, University Hospital San Luigi Gonzaga, Turin, Italy, who has previously described his experience to Medscape Medical News, says many patients with COVID-19 in his hospital presented with a negative chest X-ray but were found to have interstitial pneumonia on lung ultrasound.\nIn developing and publishing their protocol, Demi, senior author of the article, and other colleagues from the heavily affected cities of Northern Italy, say their aim is “to share our experience and to propose a standardization with respect to the use of lung ultrasound in the management of COVID-19 patients.”\nTheir research, which builds on previous work by the team, offers broad agreement with industry-led algorithms and emphasizes the use of wireless, handheld ultrasound devices, ideally consisting of a separate probe and tablet, to make sterilization easy. Firms such as the Butterfly Network, Phillips, Clarius, GE Healthcare, and Siemens are among numerous companies that produce one or more such devices, including some that are completely integrated.

Now a team of Italian physicians has developed a formal protocol for this use of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool, published in the Journal of Ultrasound Medicine and reported on in MedScape.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients. The National Health Service in England does not even mention lung ultrasound in its radiology decision tool for suspected COVID-19, specifying instead chest X-ray as the first-line diagnostic imaging tool, with CT scanning in equivocal cases. But Giovanni Volpicelli, MD, University Hospital San Luigi Gonzaga, Turin, Italy, says many patients with COVID-19 in his hospital presented with a negative chest X-ray but were found to have interstitial pneumonia on lung ultrasound.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-04-09\nTitle: First protocol on how to use lung ultrasound to triage COVID ...\nContent:\n\"The advantages of using lung ultrasound [in COVID-19] are too great to be limited by something that is not important in my opinion,\" he concluded.

The first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to quantitively and reproducibly assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection has been published by a team of Italian experts with experience of using the technology on the front line.\nHowever, lung ultrasound is not yet universally accepted as a tool for diagnosing pneumonia in the context of COVID-19 and triaging patients. The National Health Service in England does not even mention lung ultrasound in its radiology decision tool for suspected COVID-19, specifying instead chest X-ray as the first-line diagnostic imaging tool, with CT scanning in equivocal cases.\nWith regard to the use of wireless technology, the Italian team says that \"in the setting of COVID-19, wireless probes and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment,\" as they can \"easily be wrapped in single-use plastic covers, reducing the risk of contamination,\" and making sterilization easy. Stone suggests that integrated portable devices, however, are no more likely to cause cross-contamination than separate probes and tablets, as they can fit within a sterile sheath as a single unit. Volpicelli, for his part, doesn't like what he sees as undue focus on wireless devices for lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 protocols.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: The role of lung ultrasonography in COVID‐19 disease management ...\nContent:\nThen we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID‐19 care pathways.

Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak in December 2019 in China, lung ultrasound has been increasingly utilized in patient assessment and management from triage stations to high dependency or intensive care unit (ICUs). In their publication, Huang et al reported the first recognized lung ultrasound features, which follow a peculiar pattern along the chest in an upper anterior‐to‐lower posterior crescendo distribution.\nWe propose 11 lung ultrasound roles for different medical settings during the pandemic, starting from the out‐of‐hospital setting, where lung ultrasound has ergonomic and infection control advantages. Then we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID‐19 care pathways. Finally, we present outpatient use of lung ultrasound to aid follow‐up of positive case contacts and of those discharged from the hospital.\nThe current application of lung ultrasound into triage flowcharts is limited by the lack of standard scanning protocols and operator experience, which may influence the validity and interpretation of test results. Although prospective studies have not yet validated lung ultrasound‐based triage, this concept paves the way for further research efforts aimed at preventing an overwhelmed healthcare system during a possible second wave of a viral pandemic.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 discuss the first protocol for the use of lung ultrasound to assess the degree of lung involvement in patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection. The protocol was developed by a team of Italian experts with experience using the technology on the front line.

The incidence of vaping-related illnesses—mainly e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI)—went from a peak in September 2019 to a low in February 2020, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to discontinue the collection of EVALI case reports.

Most importantly, our results suggest that investment in other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be prioritized for COVID-19 randomized clinical trials,\" say the authors.\nFuture studies are needed to explore the relationship with vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes in other populations, say the researchers. “In the past Mendelian randomization has consistently predicted results of large, expensive, and timely vitamin D trials. Here, this method does not show clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation would have a large effect on COVID-19 outcomes,\" says Butler-Laporte, who is a microbiologist and an expert in infectious diseases.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2023-01-26\nTitle: Can vitamin D protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?\nContent:\nFind out what the research says about <strong>vitamin</strong> <strong>D</strong> and coronavirus disease 2019 (<strong>COVID</strong>-<strong>19</strong>).\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Vitamin D | COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines\nContent:\nVitamin D deficiency (defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤20 ng/mL) is common in the United States, particularly among people who identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black.2 These groups are overrepresented among cases of COVID-19 in the United States.3 Vitamin D deficiency is also more common in older patients and patients with obesity and hypertension; these factors have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.4 High levels of vitamin D may cause hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis.5 · There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\nThe studies summarized below are those that have had the greatest impact on the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s recommendations.  · Although multiple observational cohort studies suggest that people with low vitamin D levels are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes after infection (e.g., higher mortality), clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation provides protection against infection or improves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.6,7\nAlthough multiple observational cohort studies suggest that people with low vitamin D levels are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes after infection (e.g., higher mortality), clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation provides protection against infection or improves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.6,7  · In a double-blind trial conducted at 4 hospitals in Mexico, frontline health care workers were randomized to receive vitamin D3 4,000 IU or placebo for 30 days.8 Participants were enrolled before COVID-19 vaccines became available.\nRead information about vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nInformation 1, 2, 3, and 5 are sources that discuss the potential role of vitamin D in preventing or treating COVID-19.

Researchers are intent on finding out why. “For almost every infectious disease, the most vulnerable populations are at the extremes of age — the very young and the very old,” said Stanford Medicine professor of microbiology and immunology and of pathology Bali Pulendran, PhD. “But with COVID-19, the young are spared while the old are emphatically not.\nThe scientists pivoted to a study of COVID-19 in kids. Florian Wimmers, PhD, then a postdoc in Pulendran’s lab, and his colleagues got hold of nasal and blood samples collected from 54 infants who’d become infected with SARS-CoV-2 before reaching age 2, and from 27 other children who’d tested negative throughout the observation period. For comparison, the researchers obtained similar samples from several dozen adults. All infected children in the study were, at most, mildly symptomatic.\nAnother difference: In the blood of adults with even mild COVID-19 cases, there was a big increase in levels of a number of inflammation-promoting signaling proteins, previously shown to be associated with more-severe symptoms. In infected kids’ blood, this increase wasn’t seen.\nPulendran wants to see if any of this nasal magic extends beyond COVID-19 — he is now collaborating with the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital group on influenza and other viruses. He suspects that his COVID-19 findings may not translate directly to other respiratory infections.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID-19 in Early Life: Infants and Children Are Affected Too - PMC\nContent:\nThis meta-analysis revealed that 3.2% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had positive nasopharyngeal tests after birth (19). The virus was also detected in the cord blood and placenta and fecal or rectal swabs of neonates. Among cases where serology was tested, 3.7% was confirmed positive based on the presence of immunoglobulin M. These results have come mostly from case reports, and there is still not consensus over whether SARS-CoV-2 is vertically transmitted via the placenta to the fetus.\nAlthough COVID-19 infection is most commonly asymptomatic or mild in children, severe disease can occur as well. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37). Older children are also more likely to present with symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell (38).\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever (37).

The study, conducted by researchers at UC San Francisco and part of the PRIORITY project, found that most infants are well even when their mothers are infected by COVID-19. Among 263 infants in the study, adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, NICU admission, and respiratory disease did not differ between those born to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those born to mothers testing negative.

Furthermore, these posts noted how \"corona\" was an anagram for \"racoon,\" the city at the center of \"Resident Evil.\" This eerie coincidence wasn't too eerie on second glance. For starters, the picture on the left did not show the logo for a biotech company in Wuhan.

The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.\nBut you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.\nIf you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated.\nYes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: ...

Though more research is needed to sort out these leads, they represent potentially high-quality clues to the pathways that this virus uses to cause illness, and help to explain why some people are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to develop severe disease.\nMany factors influence our risk of illness from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. That includes being careful to limit our possible exposures to the virus, as well as whether we have acquired immunity from a vaccine or an earlier infection. But once a person is infected, a host of other biological factors, including age and pre-existing medical conditions, will influence one’s risk of becoming severely ill. While earlier studies have tied COVID-19 severity to genetic variations in a person’s antiviral defenses and blood type, we still have a lot to learn about how a person’s genetic makeup influences COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\nSo, I was pleased to see the recent findings of an impressive global effort to map the genetic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, which involved analyzing the genomes of many thousands of people with COVID-19 around the globe. This comprehensive search led to the identification of 13 regions of the human genome that appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection or severity.\nThe new study, published in the journal Nature, includes data collected through the initiative as of January 2021, and represents nearly 50,000 COVID-19 patients and another 2 million uninfected controls [1].

How does the immune system remember and recognize viral invaders it has encountered in the past? A trio of newly published studies of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated against the virus or both, are providing tantalizing new clues about the factors that influence the speed and magnitude of the immune system’s response to subsequent infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe three studies, published in Science Immunology and led by investigators at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, provide intriguing answers about how long COVID-19 immunity lasts and the nature of immune recall after infection, vaccination, or both.\nThe team analyzed the immune system’s response after infection, vaccination, and boosting by studying blood samples from individuals with different medical trajectories — those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but were not vaccinated, those who recovered from infection and were then vaccinated against COVID-19, or those who were never infected but had been vaccinated and boosted.\nIn addition, the researchers found evidence suggesting that memory of prior infection with common cold coronavirusesmild viruses that circulated before SARS-CoV-2—might be responsible for the robust, sustained immune response in a small subset of unvaccinated individuals who recover from COVID-19.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity - PubMed\nContent:\nTherefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

The state of alarm is regulated by Article 116 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and Organic Law 4/1981. The government can declare a state of alarm for a maximum of 15 days, after which it requires authorization from the Congress of Deputies to extend it.

Disclosure: Anna Sayburn has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. For decades, we've been promised that telemedicine will save primary care money and time. Yet somehow, for most NHS GP services, face-to-face consultations have remained standard operating procedure. Why go to the hassle of introducing video consultations, when everyone can pop down to the surgery? The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly changed all that.\nProfessor Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, has produced a guide on introducing video consultation for practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. She agrees that infrastructure is a problem: \"Some of them [GPs] are making it work and some are really struggling because they haven't got the infrastructure. Infrastructure issues are going to be mission critical.\" The move to online working has exposed weaknesses in the technology available to primary care, says Dr Jameel.\nBut do remote consultations work as well as face-to-face visits, even when the technology is in place? Primary care researcher Dr Helen Atherton, from the University of Warwick, had been investigating patient and clinician experience of using video consultations before the COVID-19 outbreak began.\n\"It's the lacking infrastructure which is the main problem, not the will to use it,\" she says.

One of the more comprehensive looks at this topic was a systematic review of telemedicine practice in primary care before the pandemic, including 81 studies conducted both domestically and abroad.30 The results from this study have been supplemented by other publications conducted during the pandemic, and general conclusions about patient outcomes for different categories of careare summarized below.\nThe typical model for direct-to-consumer telemedicine is a single encounter between a clinician and patient who have no preceding relationship, and the clinician is often limited by lack of on-site testing, no means to bring patient in for a face-to-face examination, and little way to ensure the patient will access follow-up care if they get worse. Telemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care.\nTelemedicine outcomes may look different when delivered within a context where physicians and patients know one another, a consistent medical record is available, on-site testing may be achievable, and there is more readily accessible follow-up care. An observational study in this type of setting (a large integrated health system) analyzed more than 1 million visits: telephone, video, and office visits, for any type of initial concern (excluding routine physical examination) during a 2-year period.\nIt seems clear thattelemedicine is likely to remain pervasive in some fashion, and this author’s review of telemedicine both prepandemic and during the pandemic shows that it is widely agreeable to those who use it and it can stand alongside standard care for a variety of acute and chronic medical conditions, with the opportunity for more research ready to be explored in the future.

However, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the government introduces new measures likely to breathe new air ensuring the survival of the ‘toxic’ gambling industry.\nThe Macedonian gambling industry has seen an exponential rise in recent years. The capital accumulated by gambling businesses has been accompanied by a simultaneous dispossession of the local and regional population, resulting in numerous socio-psychological consequences.\nThe extension of neoliberal values in the Macedonian capitalist periphery has meant the elevation of quick profit to the level of the highest social and personal goals.

Confirmed cases of the virus have been reported across the globe including Germany, the U.S. and Australia.\nCLAIM: A man in Wuhan, China, was sanitizing his apartment with alcohol when the air conditioner came on and caused an explosion and fire.

The COVID-19 has then rapidly spread to all over China and the world. It can cause symptoms including fever, difficulty in breathing, cough, and invasive lesions on both lungs of the patients [1]. It can spread to the lower respiratory tract and cause viral pneumonia.\nWuhan is a transportation hub of China, it is a highly dense city and has a large population of more than 14 million in 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) had a meeting on January 30, 2020 and they declared the coronavirus outbreak from China a public health emergency of international concern.\nIt just took 1 month for China to recognize the existence of a novel coronavirus after the first case was reported, followed with a series mandatory actions in both Wuhan and all over China. In contrast, it took more than 4 months for SARS. On December 31, 2019, delegates of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) went to Wuhan for field investigations, and the sample of new virus was isolated and further identified as a pathogen of unexplained pneumonia on January 6, 2020.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 and 2 from Lead Stories (published on 2020-02-14) both fact-check a claim that a residential building was set on fire in Wuhan to control the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit.\nThey may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible.\nRather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach.\nThus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: San José del Guaviare Jorge E.

Its death toll is unknown but is generally considerd to be more than 50 million. \"The death rate in 1918 was very high ... somewhere between 2 and 2 1/2%,\" Nancy Bristow, a history professor at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., told NPR.\nBristow, Adalja and other academics generally agree that the flu pandemic sickened around 500 million people. In comparison, worldwide coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million on Thursday. As much as medicine is struggling with the current illness, doctors had even less to fight back with a century ago. \"The 1918 pandemic was the most severe pandemic that we have on record,\" said Adalja. \"We had no ICUs at that time.

The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920.\nBy May of 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global coronavirus emergency, almost 7 million people had died of COVID-19. Each of these modern day pandemics brings renewed interest in and attention to the Spanish Flu, or “forgotten pandemic,” so-named because its spread was overshadowed by the deadliness of World War I and covered up by news blackouts and poor record-keeping.

Pharmaceutical companies worked around the clock to come up with a vaccine to fight the Spanish flu, but they were too late. The virus disappeared before they could even isolate it. America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918, by Alfred Crosby, tells the chilling story of the world's deadliest flu pandemic from a U.S. perspective and also offers many details of the epidemic's international reach.\nHowever, as historical records dating from the 1700s show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu pandemic, the result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and is left defenseless. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate, produce and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918. \"History tells us we are ready for another pandemic,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Spanish flu researcher and author of Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus.\nIn 1918, hundreds of thousands of American troops headed to Europe for the closing offensives of World War I. Estimates of the number of deaths from the pandemic range from 21 million to 50 million worldwide.

The destruction caused by that pandemic a century ago may sound familiar. Yet, direct comparisons of the 1918 flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic may not be completely fair, according to one scientist.\n“We’re talking about young individuals who were in a congregate setting at a time when vaccination overall was not that prevalent,” he says. “We didn’t fully know about disease spread as much. We knew about hygiene but didn’t understand that with a highly transmissible virus, basic sanitation measures such as hand washing weren’t going to cover you.” · Had certain conditions that occurred during the 1918 flu pandemic been replicated a century later, Srivastava suggests, we might have seen a greater impact of COVID-19 on young adults.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2020-04-03, states that the 1918 flu pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, killed more than 50 million people worldwide.

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), named by the International Classification Committee of viruses, has brought new health threats and challenges to the world. In March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by WHO.\nOn the contrary, the position statement in EASL-ESCMID recommended [43] that the dose of immunosuppressant drugs can be adjusted according to antiviral treatment regimens, because it is likely that the drugs in both regimens will interact with each other. During the pandemic, for patients undergoing liver transplantation, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected to prevent infection. In conclusion, in COVID-19 disease, elevated liver enzymes are usually mild and generally recover without treatment.\n(5) In patients with autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplantation, patients with elevated COVID-19 activity and liver biochemical reactions should not be considered to have sudden onset of disease or acute cellular rejection without biopsy confirmation.

A federal district court judge ruled last week that several of Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional—and for good reason.\nReviewing the record, which included voluminous testimony from Pennsylvania officials, Stickman found that the governor and his aides view their COVID-19 restrictions as the “new normal.” To simply give them unfettered discretion forever, therefore, “risks subordinating the guarantees of the Constitution, guarantees which are the patrimony of every citizen, to the immediate need for an expedient solution.” · That risk is ever higher, Stickman explained, where—as in Pennsylvania—the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented by executive fiat outside the normal legislative or administrative processes.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: 2020-09-29\nTitle: Federal Court in Pennsylvania Finds Governor’s COVID-19 ...\nContent:\nAs the pandemic continues, courts may be less tolerant of restrictions on civil liberties if they are no longer seen as “temporary.” Moreover, as our scientific understanding of the novel coronavirus evolves, wholesale business closures and shutdowns of society may no longer be viewed as the least restrictive means to stop the spread of COVID-19. The ongoing nature of the pandemic also raises questions regarding separation of powers and the legal authority of governors to impose restrictions without legislative approval. Courts may no longer give deference to executive actions that stray into legislative territory. For example, in May, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the state’s “safer-at-home” order and ruled that Secretary of Health Services, acting under the Governors direction, could not continue to extend stay-at-home orders indefinitely without seeking approval from the state legislature required under Wisconsin law.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, states and local governments issued sweeping orders to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. While these orders have been credited with saving lives,[1] they have also had a profound impact on the economy. Numerous legal challenges have been filed with respect to these restrictions in both federal and state courts.[2] Many of these cases raise questions regarding constitutional limits on governmental authority to restrict social and economic activity to protect the public’s health.\nExecutive actions to address the predicted fall surge in coronavirus cases should state their strategic purpose and goals, elucidate the necessity for the restrictions, and set forth criteria to determine if the actions are working and when they will be lifted. Moreover, governors may need to work with their legislatures or follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures to continue to impose restrictions. The need to protect public health from the threat of COVID-19 will continue; however, the nature and source of the protections may need to evolve to survive judicial scrutiny.\nDistrict Judge William Stickman IV of the Western District of Pennsylvania ruled that certain restrictions imposed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf and his administration were unconstitutional.

The Court concluded that these orders violated the 14th Amendment by restricting the right to intrastate travel, right to privacy (i.e., “the right be let alone while otherwise acting a lawful manner”), and the “fundamental right to simply be out and about in public.” The Court held that “[b]road population-wide lockdowns are such a dramatic inversion of the concept of liberty in a free society as to be nearly presumptively unconstitutional.”\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n* The COVID-19 virus is mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets that carry the virus.

Protest against the COVID-19 vaccine in Dublin, Ireland. In order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus which gave rise to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019, governments brought in health measures at varying levels of strictness to restrict the movement of people and transmission of the virus.\nBetween August and October 2021, several protests were held across New Zealand to protest official lockdown measures, vaccination, and spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Key groups and individuals that were involved in these protests included FACTS NZ, Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa, the NZ Liberty Movement and Jami-Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika's Advance New Zealand party. In January 2021, Te Kahika led a \"freedom rally\" outside the New Zealand Parliament; protestors opposed lockdown policies, while expressing support for US President Donald Trump and QAnon.\nOn this day, the stay-at-home order had been in place for 90 days, making it the longest mandatory quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our study did not find evidence of increased COVID-19 hospitalization rates after protests occurred in California counties. While the limitations noted underscore the need for caution with interpreting a causal relationship from our findings, the results do support the notion that it is possible to protest safely in the midst of a pandemic, ostensibly, so long as evidence-based precautionary measures are taken [48]. As the pandemic continues into its second year, public demonstrations related to COVID-19 and societal issues remain fixtures of daily life around the world [49]. Further research is needed to understand both the individual-level relationship between protest participation, SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality, particularly with more virulent strains such as the Delta variant resulting in breakthrough cases among vaccin\nThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship between public protests and county-level, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization rates across California. Publicly available data were included in the analysis from 55 of 58 California state counties (29 March–14 October 2020). Mixed-effects negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between daily county-level COVID-19 hospitalizations and two main exposure variables: any vs. no protests and 1 or >1 protest vs. no protests on a given county-day.\nThree spline variables were created to represent the three time periods in our models based on visual observation of average changes in county hospitalization rates over time (see Supplementary Figure S1 for observed vs. predicted COVID-19 hospitalization rates using this time trend). The knots (1 June and 21 July) were also selected since they provided the best model fit to predict COVID-19 hospitalization using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). To explore patterns in the data, graphs were used to describe (1) the daily average COVID-19 hospitalization rate and the total number of protests across the total sample of 55 counties, and (2) the proportion of protests by protest type, overall and for the counties with any protests.\nEthical review and approval were waived for this study since only publicly available data were used.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an upsurge of protests. The emergence of civil resistance movements is often associated with various conditions of social systems. The analysis of social systems also shows the importance of considering the behaviour time scale and in particular slow-fast dynamics. The fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon.\nThe fine-grained datasets of the sudden and dramatic disruptive force of the pandemic can be used to better grasp the different dynamics of this social phenomenon. This paper proposes a holistic approach to explore the relationship between societal conditions and the emergence of protests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the following sections we introduce a holistic analysis approach to the emergence of civil resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we discuss the theoretical basis of our approach and develop a casual loop diagram to capture these findings and conceptually model the emergence of civil resistance at a societal level. Using this conceptual model, several hypotheses on the impact of societal conditions to the emergence of protests are tested.\nWith this computational approach, we can test whether existing theoretical models for the emergence of protests provide a realistic explanation for the emergence of protest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our CLD and statistical analysis, we can model latent processes that yield protests as a function of significant factors identified with our statistical analysis.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\n1.

The findings also demonstrated a significant moderate correlation between PTSD and BOS.\nOne of the limitations of this study was that nurses' psychological and physiological conditions could not be evaluated before taking care of COVID-19 patients because the COVID-19 pandemic occurred abruptly. Moreover, PTSD is associated with some psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as depression, panic disorders, other psychiatric problems, and problems in marital, family, and social relations. Furthermore, cross-sectional correlational studies cannot determine the cause of outcomes. Therefore, one cannot use this methodology to detect and examine the outcomes, especially PTSD, easily.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic can lead to chronic BOS and acute pandemic-induced trauma by creating chronic stress in the workplace. If BOS accompanies increased workplace stress due to the pandemic, it can increase PTSD among the staff. Co-occurrence of PTSD and BOS and their consequences can lead to the combined effects of these two phenomena (40). Regarding COVID-19 as a traumatic event, Restauri and Sheridan (2020) believe such stressful events can cause acute stress disorders and PTSD if continued.\nGiven the role of PTSD especially as a predictor of burnout and the significant impact of these disorders on occupational and non-occupational activities, immediate and appropriate measures are necessary to monitor and reduce their effects on the nurses who are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic.

The results can be used by nurse leaders to inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nursing staff members working during COVID-19.\nInterventions can improve the recognition of psychological symptoms among nurses exposed to traumatic events. Other techniques, such as mindfulness and resilience training, may help mitigate the effects of PTSD. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses is not yet fully known.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with ...\nContent:\nAs people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2–5 times) [44], the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45], and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46]. Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological\n[8], the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks. According to ICD-10, PTSD typically involves symptoms that can be classified into three groups: (1) intrusion—recurrent images, dreams or memories related to the traumatic experience; (2) avoidance—of places, people or topics related to the traumatic experience, accompanied by a general decrease in activity; (3) arousal—understood as increased psychophysiological reactivity in the form of attention-deficit disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, or increased vigilance [9]. In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in nurses ...\nContent:\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected among patients with pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to many countries and regions [2]. South Korea’s first large outbreak in February 2020 occurred in a church in Daegu [3]. To handle the surging demand for hospital care at the onset of the outbreak, the government recruited additional healthcare workers [3]. Research shows that healthcare workers may experience psychological stress because of their overwhelming workload, insufficient psychological preparation, and lack of understanding of COVID-19 in the early stages [4]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can affect people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event [5]. Healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to PTSD owing to highly stressful work-related situations, such as witnessing death, trauma, and working overtime and in overcrowded settings [6, 7]. Frontline healthcare \nCOVID-19 patients were transferred to another designated hospital [20]. Since nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals can also be in a post-traumatic situation after providing direct care to COVID-19 patients, they can be examined to identify PTSD-related factors in the post-COVID period.\nExamining the factors related to PTSD in nurses working in non-COVID-19 hospitals after their direct involvement with COVID-19 patients can provide valuable insights into the post-COVID period. This study aims to investigate factors related to PTSD among nurses who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients.\nHence, it is recommended that hospitals allocate additional personnel to psychologically support nurses who provide direct care to COVID-19 patients [37]. Additionally, although it is difficult in an emergency, this study found that proper support and leadership for nurses after a traumatic event can lower PTSD.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in 2013, mentions that living in close quarters like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient units can increase the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing mood disorders.\n\nInformation 2, with no specific publication date, is a study examining the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Experts around the world have found that COVID-19 -- which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year -- is caused by a virus rather than bacteria. Scientists at Oxford University, with experience in dealing with Ebola virus, Zika virus, and SARS virus also agree that the disease is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.\nUnlike bacteria, viruses need a living host to survive and cannot be treated with antibiotics. Health authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control have rejected claims that antibiotics can cure the disease because it is not caused by bacteria. The posts also make claims connecting coronavirus to 5G networks. AFP Fact Check has debunked that here. Italy's health ministry rejected claims that painkillers such as paracetamol and aspirin could cure COVID-19.\nItaly's health ministry rejected claims that painkillers such as paracetamol and aspirin could cure COVID-19. “(Paracetamol) provides pain relief, which is very useful in case of high fever, but it does not cure coronavirus,” it said on its webpage dedicated to debunking misinformation and disinformation around COVID-19. As of June 8, 2020, the Italian health ministry maintains that “there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\nFacebook posts shared thousands of times claim that the novel coronavirus disease is caused by bacteria and can be cured with household painkillers.

When evaluated by media analysts, the effect of broadcast misinformation has been found to influence health outcomes in the population. In a natural experiment (an experiment that takes place spontaneously, without human design or intervention), two similar television news programs that were shown on the Fox News network in February–March 2020 were compared.\nIn a hearing the next day, US senator Rand Paul alleged that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan, accusing researchers including epidemiologist Ralph Baric of creating \"super-viruses\". Both Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins have denied that the US government supported such research. Baric likewise rejected Paul's allegations, saying that his lab's research into the potential in bat coronaviruses for cross-species transmission was not deemed gain-of-function by NIH or the University of North Carolina, where he works.\nReza Malekzadeh, Iran's deputy health minister and former Minister of Health, rejected claims that the virus was a biological weapon, pointing out that the US would be suffering heavily from it. He said Iran was hard-hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus, and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza.\nReza Malekzadeh, Iran's deputy health minister, rejected bioterrorism theories. An Iranian cleric in Qom said Donald Trump targeted the city with coronavirus \"to damage its culture and honor\".

The researchers also noted that: For temperatures lower than 65°C (149°F), a longer exposure time should be used. For example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed.\nFor example, the coronavirus may need to be exposed to temperatures of between 50 and 55°C (122 to 131°F) for 20 minutes to be killed. To ensure that all coronavirus particles are killed, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature by 10°C (18°F). This would mean heating the virus to 75°C (167°F) for at least 3 minutes.\nThe model estimated that the virus would be killed after an average of 2.5 minutes at 70°C (158°F). A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases assessed different ways to decontaminate N95 respirators. The researchers found that temperatures of 70°C (158°F) killed the new coronavirus on N95 respirators after about 1 hour.\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Using heat to kill SARS‐CoV‐2 - PMC\nContent:\nWe provide a reasonable estimate for near complete thermal destruction of coronavirus.

For temperatures between 55 and 60°C (131‐140°F) heating should last 5 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that these findings agree with WHO guidelines which report a 4 log reduction of coronavirus for 56°C (133°F) with 15‐minute exposures 14 and is consistent with information for killing other infectious agents. 15\nHowever, for temperatures in the range 50‐55°C (122‐131°F) we recommend 20 minutes or longer of exposure. At these levels, we expect the viral concentration to be lowered by log 5‐7, near or below the detectable limit.

The original postulates are as follows:\nIn summary, the article’s claim is false.

In most cases, the individuals used to fulfil the third postulate tend to be animals. This makes it impossible to fulfil this postulate, and by extension, the fourth postulate, in diseases specific to humans (here). Postulate Four: “The microorganism can be transferred from the infected and diseased individuals back into a pure culture.” While not an original postulate of Koch’s (here), this is essentially a repeat of step two using a different source.\nAn article that claims that researchers have not proven that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 uses outdated criteria and presents incomplete facts to make its arguments. The article focuses on how researchers have not fulfilled Koch’s postulates - a 19th-century set of criteria to show a microbe causes a disease - as they were originally understood.\nUpdated criteria for determining viruses that cause disease are sometimes still referred to as Koch’s postulates (here) These involve animals being infected with the suspect virus (here and here) and viruses being grown in cells (here), which would not be considered a “pure culture” as Koch would have understood it (here) and would not fulfil the purification criteria mentioned previously even though other microbes are removed (here). VERDICT False. Koch’s postulates, as they were originally understood, do not need to be demonstrated in order to establish that a microbe causes a disease. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and has been shown to do so by modern standards, including criteria modelled on Koch’s postulates, as well as genetic techniques that were not developed until decades after Koch’s death.\nWhile purposeful infection of humans with disease has been done historically, this is rare due to ethical concerns. However, the UK clinical trials ethics body last month approved a COVID-19 challenge study, in which healthy young volunteers will be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a safe and controlled environment (here).

Estimates suggest that about 250,000 people were infected daily at the peak of the first wave in the UK, when only 5000 daily cases were being reported by the government. For high-income countries, we do have a fair idea of how many people have died of covid-19 but there are uncertainties.\nThis study concludes that in high-income countries, more than 1 in 100 people infected by the coronavirus died in the first wave. “The death rate is at least 10 or 20 times higher than flu,” says Nicholas Brazeau at Imperial College London. More of the people admitted to hospital with covid-19 are surviving now, suggesting that the death rate has fallen slightly.\nThe death rate should be lower now because healthcare workers have more experience treating covid-19, and trials have revealed which treatments are effective. Figures from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland show that people admitted with covid-19 after 1 September were about 10 per cent less likely to die than those admitted before then. 16% Estimated coronavirus infection fatality rate for people over 90\nThe best way to work out how many people have been infected is to test the blood of thousands of people to see how many have antibodies to the coronavirus, and then extrapolate the results to entire countries. But antibody surveys can produce a misleading picture because of false positive and false negative results. The number of confirmed cases that countries report can't be used to calculate the infection fatality rate because most cases aren't detected – not everyone has symptoms, and not all who do get tested.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published in Scientific American, explains that the mortality burden of COVID-19 is growing in certain groups of people nearly three years into the pandemic.\n\nInformation 2, published on January 6, 2023, states that the number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. passed one million in 2022. It also mentions that the CDC provides numbers in a COVID Data Tracker that refreshes every weekday, but those numbers are based on modeling and could be revised with new data.\n\nInformation 3, with no publication date, states that more than 1.1 million Americans have died from COVID-19.\n\nInformation 4, with no publication date, presents official daily counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, along with vaccination rates and other vaccination data, on the World Health Organization Coronavirus disease situation dashboard.\n\nInformation 5, with no publication date, explains that the number of confirmed cases that countries report can't be used to calculate the infection fatality rate because most cases aren't detected.

Meanwhile, Fauci sometimes received criticism from Trump while serving as the former president's advisor, including after contradicting false claims Trump made about the severity of the pandemic.\nIn the interview, Gates also offered up praise for Fauci, who is now advising President Joe Biden on the pandemic, as well as Dr. Francis Collins, who Biden has retained as the head of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

There would have been approximately 80% fewer COVID-19 deaths in the United States by March 29, 2020, if the country had employed mandatory BCG vaccination since at least 2000, according to the new research.\nIn their analysis, the scientists also tried to account for other factors that could have affected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. These included the median age of populations, population size and density, and gross domestic product, or GDP, per capita. They found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied.\nThey found that having mandatory BCG vaccination significantly “flattened the curve” of the initial spread of COVID-19 throughout the populations studied. BCG vaccination was first used around a hundred years ago, when TB posed a major threat to public health. Many countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory.\nMany countries, such as China, Ireland, and France, have had universal BCG vaccination, at least until very recently, whereas others never made it mandatory, including the U.S., Italy, and Lebanon. Interestingly, the new study found that COVID-19 spread just as rapidly in countries that had only made BCG compulsory in the past 20 years as it did in countries where it was never compulsory. This suggests that a large proportion of a population must be protected by the vaccination for it to prevent COVID-19 from spreading easily, the researchers say.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nCountries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b = −0.007, P = 0.772. In terms of control variables, larger population size and higher median age predicted a faster growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.\nOur analysis shows that mandatory BCG vaccination is associated with a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, our model estimates that the total number of COVID-19–related deaths in the United States as of 29 March 2020 would have been 468—19% of the actual figure (2467)—if the United States had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary analysis 5).\nHence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (33, 34) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (11, 35). While the current analysis provided no evidence, this possibility must be addressed in future work.\nAll these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is the first to conclusively show a significant advantage of universal BCG policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19, thereby justifying a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: BCG Vaccination: A potential tool against COVID-19 and COVID-19-like ...\nContent:\nOne hypothesis links the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 to BCG vaccination rates: these substantial differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 may be associated with the universal BCG vaccination policies of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America [14]. To confirm this hypothesis, one study compared the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination or not (until at least 2000). The results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible.\nThe results revealed that mandatory BCG vaccination may have played a positive role in the fight against COVID-19 [87]. In epidemiological analysis, the interference of potential confounding factors must be considered and excluded as much as possible. Escobar et al. performed an epidemiological study, after eliminating the potential confounding factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic stages, geographical distribution, population density, and age structure, they found a 10% increase in the BCG index resulted in a 10.4% decrease in COVID-19 deaths [88]. Interestingly, a large number of subsequent ecological studies have found a similar phenomenon that BCG vaccination rates and years of implementation of the BCG vaccination policy are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [14], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113].\nAnother example is that if studies are carried out during a rapidly progressing pandemic, the number of cases and deaths may be underestimated in many low- and middle-income countries vaccinated with BCG, as these countries have fewer COVID-19 tests and more underreported / misclassified deaths [84], [114], [115]. In addition, although BCG vaccination coverage in South America and South Africa is high, the number of COVID-19 deaths in both of them is still rising rapidly with the global spread of the epidemic. A follow-up analysis from South America and South Africa found a remarkable negative correlation between BCG coverage rate and deaths of COVID-19 reported on April 22, 2020, but this negative correlation was not observed on August 1, 2020 [116], suggesting that the stage of COVID-19 transmission progression is a confounding factor that seriously affects epidemiological statistics.\nMeanwhile, the association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 mortality varies according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) in 140 countries, indicating that differences in structural health systems and policies may further confuse linkages at the population level [111]. The early effective epidemic prevention strategies of these countries may also partly explain the low COVID-19 mortality in the early stage of the epidemic, which has been successfully proved by regions or countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and South Korea [117]. Hensel J et al. found that after correction for confounding factors, no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality was observed anymore [118], as several other studies reported [119], [120]. In summary, the results from ecological studies, though most of them support the hypothesis, are highly controversial and not very credible or persuasive. Therefore, more plausible clinical trials ar\nInformation 4:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Previous BCG vaccination is associated with less severe clinical ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination, originally used to prevent tuberculosis, is known to “train” the immune system to improve defence against viral respiratory infections.

Cases were subjects with severe COVID-19 (O2 saturation < 90%, severe respiratory effort, severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock).\nThis protection may be relevant for public health in settings where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is still low and may have implications for research to identify vaccine candidates for COVID-19 that are broadly protective against mortality from future variants. Further research into the immunomodulatory effects of BCG may inform COVID-19 therapeutic research.\nGiven the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG against viral respiratory infections, the hypothesis that BCG vaccination might offer some protection against COVID-19 was raised early in the epidemic, and a number of analyses of existing data were conducted, with conflicting results [9,10,11,12,13]. More recently, original research was conducted, again with conflicting results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2020-04-07\nTitle: Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts ...\nContent:\nBCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nOur analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19. One sentence summary The presence of national policies for universal BCG vaccination is associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and resulting deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.\nThis effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

This is especially true of N95 respirators for providers and even of surgical masks to be utilized by everyone. In some locations, the shortage is critical, forcing the providers to work under unsafe conditions. In part because of the shortage, the cost of PPE is high. Many hospitals are having difficulty paying for PPE.\nThere are many disputes between providers and hospitals regarding what is appropriate PPE in each setting. Many hospitals are requiring providers to reuse their own PPE that may no longer be sterile or protective. Some hospitals that do not provide adequate PPE still restrict the providers from using PPE they own and bring to the hospital.\nAlthough some providers have lived apart from their families, it is recommended that providers continue to stay at home with their families [33-35]. This preserves everyone’s mental health. Providers should carefully follow standard precautions including utilization of appropriate PPE at work and washing hands as indicated.

They should avoid sharing utensils and items of personal use.\nAccording to unpublished accounts, as of 23rd April 2020, more than 21,800 U.S. providers had contracted COVID-19 and 71 had died.

Equally worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death3 partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.4\nThe situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million.1 The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilator\n\nInformation 1, published around May-July 2020, discusses the factors contributing to the PPE shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two specific nose cell types have been identified as likely initial infection points for COVID-19 coronavirus. Scientists discovered that goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins that the COVID-19 virus uses to get into our cells, which could help explain the high rate of transmission. The study with Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network found cells in the eye and some other organs also contain the viral-entry proteins.\nWhile it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, uses a similar mechanism to infect our cells as a related coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, the exact cell types involved in the nose had not previously been pinpointed. To discover which cells could be involved in COVID-19 transmission, researchers analysed multiple Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium datasets of single cell RNA sequencing, from more than 20 different tissues of non-infected people. These included cells from the lung, nasal cavity, eye, gut, heart, kidney and liver.\nThe global HCA Lung Biological Network continues to analyse the data in order to provide further insights into the cells and targets likely to be involved in COVID-19, and to relate them to patient characteristics. Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said: \"By pinpointing the exact characteristics of every single cell type, the Human Cell Atlas is helping scientists to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases including COVID-19 in a completely new way.\nReported today (23rd April) in Nature Medicine, this first publication with the Lung Biological Network is part of an ongoing international effort to use Human Cell Atlas data to understand infection and disease.

Researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard had been studying cell types in the human respiratory system and intestine, including the nasal cavity, lungs, and gut, where the virus has been detected. They found that the ACE2 gene, which the virus uses as a target, is critical in protecting people during lung injury but may also be exploited by the virus to infect cells.\n\nInformation 5, published in December 2001, discusses the effects of a different coronavirus (HCoV) on human nasal ciliated respiratory epithelium. However, this information is not directly related to the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and does not contradict the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered TRUE. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is most likely to target specific cells present in the nasal passages, lungs, and small intestine.", "response": "TRUE."}

The post's Thai caption translates to English as the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown, and this family was left with nothing to eat and the whole family committed suicide. However, a Google reverse image search found that the image was published in a report by Indian news website Sakshi TV on June 19, 2019, showing a mother who murdered three children by drowning and later committed suicide. The image was shared on Thai and Hindi Facebook with similar claims.\n\nInformation 3, published on 2020-04-08, also debunks the claim that the image shows a family who committed suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. The investigation found that the image has no connection with the current lockdown in India nor the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic something is, on a scale of 0-14. Something that is alkaline is on the basic end of the scale, or greater than 7.\nSome studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments – in other words, environments with a low pH. Proponents of the alkaline diet believe that if you eat a diet high in alkaline foods (high pH) and limit acidic foods, you can raise the body’s pH levels (make the body more alkaline) and make your body a poor environment for cancer.\nMore importantly, there’s no way the foods you consume can alter the pH levels of your blood.

We’ve seen such claims before and they’re still not true. Diet does not affect the pH of the body and diseases such as cancer live in slightly alkaline environments anyway.\nThe body naturally maintains a pH level that is overall slightly more alkaline than acidic, but pH also varies in different parts of the body. Your body can digest food because your stomach is acidic, while the pH of urine and saliva changes based on various factors, including diet. But the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses.\nBut the pH of the blood is kept constant, slightly alkaline, by the body, except during some illnesses. This means that, contrary to what some wellness fads would have you believe, you can’t change your body’s pH in any substantial way with diet. You can’t move the body into an “alkaline state”, any more than it naturally is.\nBut the alkaline diet consists of lots of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes. This kind of diet is considered healthy. Although you can’t cure disease from it, eating these kinds of foods could make you feel better. But this is because these are, simply put, healthy foods – not because of any changing pH levels in the blood or the body.\nInformation 5:\nPublication date: 2017-06-16\nTitle: NO DISEASE CAN EXIST IN AN ALKALINE ENVIRONMENT — Natural Food ...\nContent:\nThe pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.

As cancer progresses, the body becomes more and more acidic as its pH drops below 7.35. His discoveries were revolutionary for their time, and contributed greatly to what we know about cancer today. The pH scale ranges from 1 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline), while your body’s pH usually hovers between 7.35 and 7.4.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on 2019-05-08, explains the concept of the alkaline diet and its origins. It states that the body's pH level is tightly regulated and cannot be significantly altered through diet. The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, with 0-6 being acidic, 7 neutral, and 8-14 basic. The body strives to maintain a pH of 7.365. Eating an 80/20 ratio of alkaline to acidic foods is recommended for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nInformation 2, published on 2019-07-03, further emphasizes the importance of maintaining an alkaline state in the body to prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health. It suggests a breathing technique to alkalize the body.\n\nInformation 3 and 4, undated but published by the same source, reinforce the idea that diet does not affect the pH of the body. The body maintains a constant, slightly alkaline pH in the blood, and diseases like cancer live in slightly alkaline environments.

It promotes alkaline water as a means to maintain health and prevent illness.\n\nClaim Assessment:\n\nThe claim, published on 2020-02-26, states that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. However, the information presented suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body. The body tightly regulates its pH, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments. Therefore, maintaining an alkaline state does not provide protection against contagion.\n\nReasoning and Evidence:\n\nBased on the information provided, the claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that maintaining an alkaline state in the body can help avoid contagion. In fact, the information suggests that diet does not significantly affect the pH of the body, and diseases like cancer thrive in slightly alkaline environments.

Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) continues to hit-hard on many countries across the world. Uganda reported its first case of COVID-19 on the March 21, 2020 (Coronavirus Disease, 2020).\nIn addition to the truck drivers, two cases of local transmission have been reported among Uganda Police Force officers, which may indicate an on-going community transmission of COVID-19. ... Cumulative COVID-19 cases in Uganda (Source: Ministry of Health Uganda.\nInformation 2:\nPublication date: None\nTitle: Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and ...\nContent:\nOn March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai.\nOther countries have reported lower proportions of asymptomatic patients among their initial cases [8,9,10,11,12,13]. The high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Uganda is undoubtedly due to the national strategy, implemented on March 13, 2020, of testing all incoming travelers from high-risk countries and subsequently recalling and testing travelers from all countries, regardless of symptoms. As one of the last countries to be affected by COVID-19 globally, Uganda benefitted from the knowledge accrued during outbreaks in other settings and selected an initial testing strategy based on risk rather than presentation with symptoms, as was used in many other countries.\nThis is consistent with accruing data from around the globe demonstrating that an even higher proportion of cases than initially suspected are asymptomatic or are minimally symptomatic [25,26,27]. The relatively young age of most case-persons in Uganda may also have contributed to the outcomes, however. Severity of the disease is known to increase with advanced age and co-morbidities [8, 28, 29]. The mean age of our case-persons was 35 years. In contrast, in Italy, where the case-fatality rate was 12% in mid-March 2020, the median age of the COVID-19 patients was 64 years [30, 31]. Although approximately two-thirds of the case-persons were male, this is likely a result of a gender bias in incoming travelers, many of whom were businessmen, rather than a meaningful epidemiologic pattern specific to Uganda.\nPorous borders in particular pose a major risk in Uganda, as they did with Ebola [33]. Focusing of strict border security and screening interventions, including testing of all persons crossing the border, is critical to the continued protection of Uganda. Identification of community-based approaches to ensure identification and testing of persons traveling through informal crossings will also be critical. For a coordinated strategy across East African regional member states to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as uniform application of testing strategies, could also facilitate improved control in the region.\nInformation 3:\nPublication date: 2023-11-06\nTitle: COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda - Wikipedia\nContent:\nThe case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

The confirmed case was a 36-year-old male who had travelled to Dubai on 17 March 2020 for a business trip. On returning to Uganda on 21 March 2020 at around 2 am aboard Ethiopian Airlines, his temperature was said to be 38.7C during the screening process at Entebbe Airport which prompted the health team at the airport to isolate him at the airport for further follow up.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Uganda in March 2020. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

The new measures, which will be effective from Monday morning, include the closure of all educational institutions, some bans on travel, the shutdown of weekly open markets, and the suspension of church services. Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa's tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle.\n[1/2]A civilian receives relief food during a government distribution exercise to civilians affected by the lockdown, as part of measures to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kampala, Uganda April 4, 2020.

At the end of January 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC). The PHEOC was established in 2013; since then, it has been the MoH’s “central focal point for organizing, coordinating, supporting, and managing all aspects of evidence-based public health emergency response efforts.”1,2\nThe COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan managed the key pillars of Uganda’s direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including coordination and oversight, surveillance and laboratory systems, case management, risk communication, community engagement, logistics, and the continuity of essential health services (EHS).3 It also activated and coordinated response teams for key pandemic response activities such as surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in local districts nationwide, even before most had reported a single case of COVID-19.3\nIn response to the delta surge in the early part of 2021, authorities in Uganda developed a National Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Resurgence Plan to cover the period between June 2021 and June 2022.11 The new plan reintroduced COVID-19 control measures, including a lockdown, and restricted travel from high-risk countries.12 It updated interventions in all the key areas the previous plan covered. For instance, the new plan shifted focus to home-based care for COVID-19 patients instead of institutional case management, to make more efficient use of limited resources as case counts increased, and it proposed the establishment of new regional emergency operations centers to improve subnational pandemic response.\nOn March 18, 2020, even before Uganda reported its first COVID-19 case, President Yoweri Museveni closed the country’s airports and territorial borders, quarantined travelers when they arrived in the country, and suspended all mass gatherings—including worship services, concerts, rallies, and cultural gatherings.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1 provides details about Uganda's first 100 COVID-19 cases, including the first case being a 36-year-old businessman who had traveled to Dubai and presented with fever and flu-like symptoms upon his return to Entebbe International Airport.

Specifically, Information 2, 4, and 5 all confirm that New Zealand had no hospitalized COVID-19 patients and no new cases for at least five days prior to the claim's publication date. Therefore, the claim is likely true based on the available information.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe claim was published on 2020-06-12, and the information provided in the sources supports the claim.

While the original post likely overstated the threat from hand sanitizer exploding (see below), there is a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\nThe main concern from leaving alcohol-based hand sanitizer in a hot car, however, could be for a different reason than fire ignition. Alcohol in hand sanitizer can partially evaporate in hotter temperatures, and alcohol is what the Center for Disease Control recommends for effective hand-washing and disinfecting.\nBut, fortunately, you don’t need to add “take the hand sanitizer out of the car” to that list, although it’s probably a good idea for a different reason than you might think. A viral social media post last week from a Wisconsin fire department warned about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding inside a car during hot weather.\nOther investigations have determined that there is a chance that hand sanitizer could create a fire or an explosion, but it would likely be far smaller than those indicated in social media posts.

Keeping it in your car during hot weather, exposing it to sun causing magnification of light through the bottle,” WLFD wrote.\nOn May 22, NFPA published another video to debunk alcohol-based hand sanitizer car fire claims. “Despite some information currently being released on social media and in the news, the short answer is no,” Verzoni wrote. “From a fire safety standpoint, it is not unsafe to leave hand sanitizer inside a hot vehicle.”\nGreg Boyce, Florida Gulf Coast University department of chemistry and physics associate professor, said hand sanitizer should not be kept in a car for more than a few hours during a March 26 interview with ABC. “If you are running errands and want to keep it in the car, that’s fine,” Boyce said. “But you shouldn’t be leaving it in the car indefinitely.” · Cathy Pagendarm, Quanta Services Inc. and WLFD have not responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment. We rate the claim that alcohol-based hand sanitizer stored in hot cars can ignite FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\n\nInformation Summary:\n\nInformation 1, published on May 22, 2020, from an article on Car and Driver, discusses a warning issued by the fire department of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, about the potential for alcohol-based hand sanitizer bottles to explode in cars. The National Fire Protection Association also echoes this warning, stating that hand sanitizer has a low flashpoint and can emit flammable vapors even without an external heat source. The CDC considers alcohol-based hand sanitizer a flammable liquid that can readily evaporate at room temperature into an ignitable vapor.\n\nInformation 2, published on May 28, 2020, from an article on Global News, shares a statement from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal and the National Fire Protection Association. They tested alcohol-based sanitizers and found that they would not ignite or explode if left in a hot vehicle, even in temperatures as high as some lava. However, hand sanitizer should be stored out of direct sunlight in an upright position and should only be applied to dry hands.\n\nInformation 3, published on May 26, 2020, from an article on The Denver Post, discusses a viral social media post from a Wisconsin fire department warning about the possibility of alcohol-based hand sanitizer exploding in a car during hot weather. The article explains that while the threat from hand sanitizer exploding might be overstated, there is still a possibility that it could cause an explosion if exposed to enough heat and/or sunlight.\n\nInformation 4, published on May 24, 2020, from an article on WFTV, shares a statement from a fire expert who explains that a car's internal temperature would need to reach 572 degrees to cause hand sanitizer to explode. The expert also recommends keeping hand sanitizer with you and allowing it to dry for about a minute after applying it.\n\nInformation 5, published on June 2, 2020, from an article on USA TODAY, states that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable but can only ignite if a flame is introduced. Experts say that although leaving small amounts of ABHS in your car does not pose a significant fire risk, it should not be kept in vehicles because high temperatures can lower its disinfectant ability.\n\nClaim Accuracy:\n\nConsidering the information provided, the claim that a car blew up in Belém, Brazil, because the driver cleaned his key with alcohol-based hand sanitizer is likely false. The information presented in the sources indicates that while alcohol-based hand sanitizer is flammable, it requires a flame source to ignite, and the possibility of it exploding in a car due to heat or sunlight is minimal.
