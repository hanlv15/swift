If the content described by the CLAIM is correct, then classify it as TRUE; if the content described by the CLAIM is incorrect, then classify it as FALSE.\\n\\nCLAIM:\\nPublication date: 2020-02-20\\nContent: Social media posts claim Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, can cure COVID-19.\\n\\nPRIOR KNOWLEDGE:\\nInformation Expansion and Summary:\\n\\nInformation 1 describes the FDA's review of safety issues related to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for these drugs in treating COVID-19 due to serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure. The FDA also warns of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions and reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin and other QT prolonging medicines.\\n\\nInformation 2 is a fact check by Reuters, debunking the claim that a 2005 chloroquine/SARS study proves hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against COVID-19. The article states that existing evidence on the drug’s effectiveness against COVID-19 remains inconclusive. The NIH recommends against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial. A recent study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents found that unsupervised use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19 can expose the public to serious adverse drug effects.\\n\\nInformation 3 states that quinine, along with its synthetic relatives chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are chemical compounds normally used as anti-malarial drugs. They are not proven to work as treatments for COVID-19, nor approved by the FDA as such. Social media posts recommend tonic water and zinc as a cure for a novel coronavirus infection, as the drink contains quinine, whose synthetic relative hydroxychloroquine is on trial as a COVID-19 treatment. The claim is false; quinine in tonic water is too diluted to have any effect, and there are no drugs proven to cure the disease.\\n\\nInformation 4 is a review of studies on the effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating people ill with COVID-19, preventing the disease in people at risk of getting the disease, and people exposed to the virus. The authors do not think new studies of hydroxychloroquine should be started for treatment of COVID-19.\\n\\nInformation 5 discusses the role of antimalarial drugs – namely chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – in the management of COVID-19 patients. The results of preliminary large-scale randomized controlled trials have failed to show any survival benefit of such drug therapy in COVID-19. Most experts are against the use of HCQ in treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Indiscriminate unsupervised use of these drugs as a prophylactic or therapeutic weapon can cause serious side effects, mostly related to cardiotoxicity.\\n\\nClaim Verification:\\n\\nThe claim that chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, can cure COVID-19 is false based on the available information. The FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 due to serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues. Existing evidence on the drug’s effectiveness against COVID-19 remains inconclusive, and the NIH recommends against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial. Social media posts recommending tonic water and zinc as a cure for a novel coronavirus infection are also false, as quinine in tonic water is too diluted to have any effect, and there are no drugs proven to cure the disease.

      "NH4Cl exhibits a more pronounced effect than does chloroquine on terminal glycosylation, highlighting the novel intricate differences between chloroquine and ammonium chloride in affecting the protein transport or glycosylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and its receptor, ACE2, despite their well-established similar effects of endosomal pH elevation. The infectivity of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV are also affected by chloroquine, as exemplified by the human CoV-229E [15]. The inhibitory effects observed on SARS-CoV infectivity and cell spread occurred in the presence of 1–10 μM chloroquine, which are plasma concentrations achievable during the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria (varying from 1.6–12.5 μM) [26] and hence are well tolerated by patients.\n",
