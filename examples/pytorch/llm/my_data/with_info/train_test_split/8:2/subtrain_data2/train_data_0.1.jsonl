Results\n3.1. Rapid weather variability preconditions influenza epidemic\n2. the deadly influenza epidemic in many countries over northern mid-latitudes in the winter of 2017–2018, one of the warmest winters in recent decades. Here, we reveal that the widely spread 2017–2018 influenza epidemic can be attributed to the abnormally strong rapid weather variability. We demonstrate, from historical data, that the large rapid weather variability in autumn can precondition the deadly influenza epidemic in the subsequent months in highly populated northern mid-latitudes; and\n3. We posit that warm winters are more likely to be succeeded by early and severe influenza seasons due to fewer people being infected due to the warm weather, thereby leaving an unnaturally large fraction of susceptible individuals in the population going into the next season. The severity of the next season could potentially be exacerbated by the early onset, if the onset occurs before most of the population has had the opportunity to be vaccinated.\n4. In the event of continued global warming, warmer than average winters are expected to occur more frequently, but variability in seasonal temperatures will of course remain, and average winters will still occur with regularity for some time to come. Our work suggests that mild influenza seasons during unusually warm winters are a harbinger of the likelihood of an unusually severe season to come. Hence, these findings could guide improved prevention efforts, including progressive vaccination\n5. deadly influenza epidemic in the subsequent months in highly populated northern mid-latitudes; and the influenza epidemic season of 2017–2018 was a typical case. We further show that climate model projections reach a consensus that the rapid weather variability in autumn will continue to strengthen in some regions of northern mid-latitudes in a warming climate, implying that the risk of an influenza epidemic may increase 20% to 50% in some highly populated regions in the later 21st century.\n", "response": "TRUE."}

Zinc and COVID-19\n2. 2. Zinc and COVID-19\nIn view of the global COVID-19 pandemic, potential protective effect of zinc is of particular interest. Zinc is considered as the potential supportive treatment in therapy of COVID-19 infection due to its immune modulatory effect, as well as direct antiviral effect (36). However, the existing data will be only mechanistically discussed in this review, as direct data on anti-COVID-19 effects of zinc are absent to date.\n3. Background COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital\n4. Due to the clearly demonstrated role of zinc in immunity (2), and impaired zinc status in ageing (35), metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases (13), it is speculated that zinc compounds may be used as an adjunct therapy in COVID-19 treatment (36) for increasing antiviral resistance (37). Of note, zinc was earlier suggested as the potential agent for immune support and prevention of H1N1 influenza ('swine flu') (38).\n5. Data also suggests patients with low levels of zinc in their blood fare worse with COVID-19 than those with normal levels. But again, there is no evidence that supplementing with zinc improves COVID-19 outcomes.\nResearchers have suggested that melatonin, a natural sleep aid, may help reduce inflammation and therefore provide benefit to COVID-19 patients, though studies into its effectiveness are just beginning.\n", "response": "TRUE."}

Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 to date significantly alter viral transmission. To do so, we developed a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified\n2. We measured SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in terms of the basic (R0) and net (Rt) reproduction numbers. These quantities represent the mean number of secondary infections generated by 1 primary infector in a fully susceptible population (R0) and in the presence of control interventions and human behavioral adaptations (Rt). When Rt decreases below the threshold of 1, the number of new infections begins to decline. Estimates were obtained through a Bayesian approach applied to case-based\n3. but more studies are needed to quantify this association more precisely. If both the proportion and transmissibility of asymptomatic infection are relatively low, people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection should account for a smaller proportion of overall transmission than presymptomatic individuals. This is consistent with the findings of the only mathematical modelling study in our review that explored this question [19]. Uncertainties in estimates of the true proportion and the relative\n4. To evaluate the impact of the D614G substitution in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmissibility, we set up eight pairs of hamsters for each virus similar to previous studies (11, 12). Each pair comprised a naïve hamster adjacent to a cage with an infected animal 1 day after infection (fig. S2, E and F). Viral titers in the nasal wash samples from all animals were monitored. Both WT and D614G viruses were transmitted efficiently to naïve hamsters, as evidenced by positive nasal wash samples detected\n5. To figure out transmissibility for certain, scientists have to bring B.1.1.7 into the lab and see if it's better at infecting cells and spreading between animals.\n- Even if the variant is more transmissible, it might not change the course of the pandemic.\nSARS-CoV-2 is already spreading quickly around the world.

In a Quinnipiac University national poll last month, four out of five likely voters said they believed masks to be effective at slowing the spread of the virus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the C.D.C., told Congress that wide use of face masks would bring the pandemic under control and might offer more protection than a vaccine.\nOutside a Giant food store in Hershey, Joanne Clark, who said she worked part time in a hospital, added that she, too, did not trust C.D.C. statistics.\n2. It’s important to note, however, that wearing a mask is only one of several preventative measures that people should be taking during this pandemic, such as frequently washing their hands and maintaining a safe social distance (6 feet apart) while in public. Or, as Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said: “Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic.”\n3. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an updated scientific brief earlier this month that for the first time emphasized the ability of masks to protect wearers, based on lab studies that find masks can block virus particles and some observational and epidemiology studies.\nThe other editorial — by experts with the public health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, including former CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden — highlighted several limitations of the study.\n4. Masks alone are not enough to stop the spread.\nThe experts all emphasized that mask use is just one tool that can slow the pandemic. Social distancing, ventilation and hand hygiene are also important.\n“None of those is 100 percent effective by itself,” Dr. Marr said. “But when we combine them, then we can make a big dent in the risk of transmission.”\n5. “The more people who wear a mask, the more the community is protected and therefore the more you individually benefit,” said Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Covid-19 response program. “It’s like a herd effect.”\n", "response": "TRUE."}

(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Wednesday its coronavirus antibody cocktail - the experimental treatment that U.S. President Donald Trump received - significantly reduced medical visits in a trial of nearly 800 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.\nRegeneron said patients given the treatment, REGN-COV2, made around 57% fewer COVID-19 related medical visits than those given a placebo over a 29 day period.\n2. The test results only involved 275 patients, but doctors not involved in the drug's development said it appeared promising. The treatment showed positive trends for reducing patient medical visits, none of whom were sick enough for hospitalization, Regeneron said.\n3. Regeneron hasn’t yet accumulated enough data to show the same protection. Its trial had only 12 patients who had “COVID-19–related medically attended visits.” Although there was a trend toward more of these in the placebo group than treatment arms, only one was hospitalized.\n4. The drug maker Regeneron said on Friday that it would stop enrolling very sick people in a trial of its antibody treatment in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, in another sign that the treatments appear to not work well in patients who have advanced forms of the disease.\n5. Although Regeneron's antibody therapy is unproven, it is \"a promising treatment,\" Frieden told CNN.\n\"There's a report that only fewer than 300 patients have received it,\" he said. \"It seems to be most effective early in the disease, especially before patients make antibodies of their own.\"\n\"We don't know if it'll be helpful, but it's something that is not unreasonable to try,\" Frieden said.\n", "response": "TRUE."}

This analysis finds:\n3. About 18% of them were 45 to 55 years old, and 20% were 20 to 44 years old. It's not clear from the CDC analysis whether these younger patients had underlying medical conditions or habits (such as smoking) that would make them more vulnerable.\nAnd while children and teens can spread the coronavirus, they appear to be much less vulnerable. The CDC report found no deaths among people 19 and younger — and less than 1% of hospitalizations involved people in that age range.\n4. In fact, recent modeling based on Chinese data shows that asymptomatic carriers of the virus may have been responsible for its initial rapid spread there.\nAnd the virus seems to be affecting young people in the United States more than it has in China.

But with the added induction of the trained innate cells, the MMR vaccination could provide protection against the worst sequelae of COVID-19. In direct support of this concept, it was recently reported that the milder symptoms seen in the 955 sailors on the U.S.S.

If our hypothesis is correct, MMR (booster) vaccination in adults represents a “low-risk–high-reward” preventive measure to save lives during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n3. We propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing “trained” nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent\n4.

Objective\nTo determine if school closure and its timing were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\n2. In this study, changes in COVID-19 incidence and mortality associated with school closure were isolated to the extent possible by adjusting for other state-enacted policies and testing rates. In adjusted models, school closure was associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and deaths. These analyses do not incorporate the risks of school closure on child education and development or from a societal perspective. However, the analyses suggest that school closure may be effective in curbing\n3. Between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, school closure in the US was temporally associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality; states that closed schools earlier, when cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was low, had the largest relative reduction in incidence and mortality. However, it remains possible that some of the reduction may have been related to other concurrent nonpharmaceutical interventions.\n4. The analyses presented here suggest that the timing of school closure plays a role in the magnitude of changes associated with school closure. As hypothesized, school closure in states that enacted this intervention early (when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was low) had greater associated relative decreases in incidence and mortality.

It cites a study to claim that natural infection produces better and longer-lasting immunity than vaccination. The cited study makes no such conclusions[2].

LONDON (Reuters) - People recovering from COVID-19 may suffer significant brain function impacts, with the worst cases of the infection linked to mental decline equivalent to the brain ageing by 10 years, researchers warned on Tuesday.\nA non-peer-reviewed study of more than 84,000 people, led by Adam Hampshire, a doctor at Imperial College London, found that in some severe cases, coronavirus infection is linked to substantial cognitive deficits for months.\n2. “The trail of the virus, when it invades the brain, leads almost straight to the hippocampus,” explains Dr. de Erausquin. “That is believed to be one of the sources of the cognitive impairment observed in COVID-19 patients. We suspect it may also be part of the reason why there will be an accelerated cognitive decline over time in susceptible individuals.”\n3. “That’s why we’re seeing severe disease and all these multiple symptoms like heart disease, stroke, and all these long-haulers with loss of smell, loss of taste,” explains the senior researcher. “All of this has to do with the brain, rather than with the lungs.”\nKumar cautions that the brain damage may mean that many people with COVID-19 continue to be at high risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, or general cognitive decline, after recovering.\n4. The aim is to understand how having COVID-19 increases the risk, severity, and progression of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, or psychiatric conditions, such as depression.\nOther research adds to the concerns expressed by Dr. de Erausquin, Dr. Seshadri, and their colleagues — specifically regarding the risk of delirium and coma.\n5. The researchers noted several mechanisms by which the COVID-19 virus may cause brain damage, including through the dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system.\n\"Inflammatory response of the CNS to viral infection seems to be another important reason for poor neurological outcome and occurrence of delirium,\" in COVID-19 patients, they said.\n", "response": "TRUE."}

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, RCTs have been launched around the world, including an adaptive trial sponsored by the NIH.3 This unprecedented speed from concept to implementation in just a few weeks is noteworthy and provides proof that clinical trials can be promptly initiated even in the middle of a pandemic. The rapid and simultaneous combination of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to find effective and safe treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak.\n3. China is currently running more randomized treatment trials than any other country, closely followed by the United States. So far, most countries hit hard by COVID-19 are hosting at least one randomized study, with the exception of Spain and Iran. This will likely change over time — the World Health Organization (WHO) is working on a randomized, multicenter adaptive trial that will cover \"multiple sites,\" so far unspecified.\n4.

An estimated 60–75% of EIDs are comprised of zoonotic diseases; of these, more than 70% have purportedly originated in wildlife species [3–5]. Spillover has been largely attributed to changes in anthropogenic activity subsequent to exponential human population growth since the latter half of the 20th century. Large-scale land use change, such as deforestation and land conversion for agriculture, can alter host-pathogen relationships and increase human encounter rates with wildlife and their\n2. pigs. The risks are higher than ever (2, 3) as increasingly intimate associations between humans and wildlife disease reservoirs accelerate the potential for viruses to spread globally. Here, we assess the cost of monitoring and preventing disease spillover driven by the unprecedented loss and fragmentation of tropical forests and by the burgeoning wildlife trade. Currently, we invest relatively little toward preventing deforestation and regulating wildlife trade, despite well-researched plans\n3. We found that the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species increases with host phylogenetic proximity to humans, and that this relationship is significant even when we removed ‘reverse zoonoses’ primarily associated with transmission from humans to primates (Methods). This is the first time this relationship has been demonstrated using data for all mammals and specifically as a determinant of zoonotic spillover, and is supported by previous taxon-specific studies that have examined host\n4.

Samples were also collected from humans (n = 1,124) in seven countries in central Africa and Asia as a pilot to begin to explore the propensity for viral sharing with wildlife. In all twenty countries, wildlife samples were collected from ‘high risk’ interfaces, where direct or indirect contact with humans might promote zoonotic viral transmission. The selected sampling sites included areas of land-use change (deforestation, conversion to agriculture);\n5. Construction of logging roads to extract timber created access to deeply forested areas previously largely untouched by humans, Mr Epstein said, bringing them into contact with disease-carrying wildlife. Displacement of animals that lived in those forests also forced them to find new habitats, increasing the chance of them spreading pathogens to other species, including humans.\n", "response": "TRUE."}

White side out (this is the filter part) for when you’re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in.” Is this a useful tip to stop the spread of diseases? Masks don’t stop\n3.

Soap is very effective at inactivating this virus, and furthermore, when you wash your hands as opposed to using hand sanitizer, then the water actually washes, physically, any particles that might be on your hands off of them.\n2. To curb the virus’ spread, experts stress the importance of hand hygiene: keeping your hands clean by regularly lathering up with soap and water, or, as a solid second choice, thoroughly rubbing them down with an alcohol-based sanitizer. That might sound like simple, even inconsequential advice. But such commonplace practices can be surprisingly powerful weapons in the war against infectious disease.\n3. however, also recognized the limitations to the effectiveness of handwashing. Careful control and monitoring of handwashing resulted in an ∼50% reduction in transmission. They demonstrated that hands of personnel are probably the most important source of transmission to patients but that “at best the available means of control afford only moderate reduction in transmission. Thus, further approaches must be sought” [14].\n4. It seems reasonable to assume that handwashing with soap is also more effective in reducing bacterial load compared to water alone. Future studies could address the effect of different hand hygiene procedures on removing gastro-intestinal or respiratory viruses such as influenza A. Hands have been implicated especially in the spread of Norovirus [16]. Viral studies are more difficult to conduct as viruses may not be as present in the environment as often as are bacteria of faecal origin, but\n5. women. So far, we have seen epidemics in countries with advanced health systems. But even they had trouble coping. As the virus moves to low-income countries, we are very concerned about limpact that could have on people where the prevalence of HIV is high, or malnourished children. This is why we ask each country and every person to do everything possible to stop the transmission. Wash hands helps reduce the risk of being infected.But it is also an act of solidarity because it reduces the risk\n", "response": "TRUE."}

Conclusion It is not true that Shanghai and Beijing have not registered cases of Covid-19.

Data on distances between locations\n5. individuals indicate that Hubei, Lombardy, and New York City could experience new outbreaks in the absence of continued interventions to reduce transmission. Despite this, between-population differences remain substantial; Hubei, Lombardy, and New York City have each had distinct experiences with COVID-19 that must be considered with respect to future policy responses.\n", "response": "FALSE."}

Memory Loss. In studies, people with AFib did worse on memory and learning tests than those without the condition. Dementia is also more common in people with AFib.\nOne possible reason for the link is that AFib raises your odds for a stroke, which can damage the brain. AFib might also affect memory by keeping the brain from getting enough blood.\n2. It is also possible that the harms of the treatments they are offered could outweigh any reduction in stroke risk. In fact, the blood-thinning drugs used to prevent stroke in people with a-fib can make it difficult to stop bleeding and can even lead to an uncommon but serious kind of stroke caused by bleeding into the brain.\n3. There no evidence yet that treating people for a-fib that’s first detected by an Apple Watch will result in a net benefit when strokes averted are balanced against excessive bleeding and complications from procedures for a-fib like catheter ablation or the implantation of a Watchman device. And the Apple Heart Study will not provide this proof.\n4. In 2014, a large-scale two-year study in Finland in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia (the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability, or FINGER Study) reported that a two-year combination therapy simultaneously targeting physical exercise, a healthy diet, cognitive stimulation, and self-monitoring of heart health risk factors had a protective effect on cognitive function.

They're politicizing it,” he said. “They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.’ That did not work out too well. They could not do it.

Rather, the study acknowledges that effective measures for reducing the spread of COVID-19, such as face masks and physical distancing, are difficult to implement in certain situations, such as going to a restaurant, which can lead to an increased risk of infection:\n3.

There is an urgent need for blood donations right now, to meet the needs of patients in hospitals as surgical procedures and treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to COVID-19 resume. At the same time, blood drives continue to be canceled, as many businesses and community organizations restrict the number of individuals at their locations creating challenges for a stable blood supply. It’s important to remember that blood is perishable and cannot be stockpiled.\n2. “We are facing a national blood supply issue. As coronavirus fears intensify, blood centers around the country are experiencing a significant decrease in donations and blood drives are being canceled,” said Kate Fry, CEO of America’s Blood Centers, an organization that represents nearly 50 blood centers throughout the United States and Canada, and collects close to 60% of the nation’s blood supply.\n3.

However, while some neurologic subspecialties lend themselves to this online transition, others face greater challenges.\n2.

COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.\n3. We expanded primary care through telemedicine. If patients called for concerns that they had COVID-19, they were screened through a virtual visit with the use of Cleveland Clinic’s Express Care Online or called their primary care provider. If they needed to travel to our locations, we asked them to call ahead before arrival.

The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in the COVID-19 pandemic has not been fully evaluated. With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to better understand the impact of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID patients. PubMed, Embase and the pre-print database Medrxiv were searched, and studies with data on patients on ACEi/ARB with COVID-19\n3. In such an unprecedented pandemic, the role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in COVID-19 has been questioned. The particular concern emerged given the significant role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-COV-2, which enables entry into host cells [3]. Considering the substantial expression of ACE2 receptors in the respiratory and cardiovascular system, it is not a surprise that\n4.

In response to the recent outbreaks, many European countries are imposing new restrictions, but avoiding total lockdowns. In essence, some experts say, they are quietly adopting the Swedish approach.\n2. Sweden didn’t go into lockdown or impose strict social-distancing policies. Instead, it rolled out voluntary, ‘trust-based’ measures: it advised older people to avoid social contact and recommended that people work from home, wash their hands regularly and avoid non-essential travel. But borders and schools for under-16s remain open — as do many businesses, including restaurants and bars.\n3. It is also the case that Sweden has taken a very broad view of the health challenges posed by a complete lockdown. Mental health and other issues -- perhaps not a priority elsewhere -- are generally just a bigger part of the health strategy here. This is probably the most defining aspect of Sweden's approach and speaks to a culture which values well-being in its broadest form.\n4. Consider too that the effects of intensive restrictions on freedom of movement wanes over time as social disobedience increases. Deploying milder containment strategies, as Sweden has done, which are followed by nearly all, may be more effective than strict interventions that are frequently flouted. Here, it will be interesting to see how Sweden compares to the other Nordic countries, which may have been able to achieve high levels of compliance with voluntary social distancing.\n5. “Many people think that because Sweden did not lock down, the government did nothing,” he said. “In fact it took several key measures. But mainly, it managed to make citizens understand and participate in the fight against the virus, without coercion, mandatory laws or regulations.
